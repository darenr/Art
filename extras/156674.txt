Marclay created this monumental work by unspooling magnetic tapes from music cassettes (by the bands and musicians named in the work's title) and draping them across light-sensitive paper. The dramatic, swirling forms recall Abstract Expressionist paintings of the 1950s, an area of great strength in MoMA's collection. Printmaking is one of the tools Marclay uses in his ongoing exploration of the intersection between sound, performance, and the visual arts, incorporating unconventional approaches, such as printing from inked vinyl LPs.
