In his first book project Dion assumed the role of an eighteenth– or nineteenth–century naturalist, exploring and documenting the flora and fauna of a fictional terra incognita. Assembled as a field guide, the book reproduces writings, drawings, and photographs of the artist's observations and discoveries in this unknown land.
