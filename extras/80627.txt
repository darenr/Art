Ofili here employs African–inspired motifs, glitter, collaged cutouts from popular magazines, and, most notoriously, elephant dung. The latter material has associations for him with African tribal culture, but its unusual use in his paintings has proven an affront to some, particularly in works that confront racial and religious stereotypes. Such notoriety might have obscured Ofili's primary involvement with hip–hop culture as a resource for his art at this time. He has stated, "I'm trying to make paintings that make you hear them, rather than see them."
