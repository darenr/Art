The standard practice for creating color woodcuts is to carve separate woodblocks for each color and then ink and print them successively, one over the other, on a sheet of paper. Munch devised a simplified process in which he cut out each section of the composition from a single woodblock, like a jigsaw puzzle. He then inked each element in the desired color and fit all the pieces back together. With this method, printing required only one run through the press.
