Among the numerous drawings Matisse made of women seen from behind are a group of 1909 works showing a model posed against the slatted wall of his new studio. This drawing, relating to the bas-relief sculpture Back (I), shows the model supporting her weight on one leg, her right foot hidden. The bold pen-and-ink hatchings are analogous to the firm contours Matisse cut with a chisel into the plaster surface of the sculpture.
