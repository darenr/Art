A renowned graphic designer in Venezuela, Leufert was also a printmaker, draftsman, photographer, painter, art teacher, and museum curator. His strong interest in printmaking and draftsmanship led to the founding of the Department of Modern Prints and Drawings at the Caracas Museum of Fine Arts and the establishment of the Art Graphic Workshop, also in Caracas, two initiatives that played an important role in the constitution of modern graphic art in Venezuela.Considered one of Leufert's most important print series, this work incorporates both the geometric and organic elements of his artistic vocabulary. In the title, nenias means "elegies," and Leufert pays homage here to an indigenous Venezuelan and Brazilian tribe, the Yanomami, whose artwork served as a source for his formal language.
