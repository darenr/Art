This large-scale wall stencil—titled Kwakuhlekisa, a Zulu word meaning "amusing" or "absurd"—was created from a digital image and can be scaled up or down, depending on the space available. Spaceships have appeared in Platter's drawing, video animation, and sculpture in recent years as symbols of "ushering in or delivering change when things get out of control on earth," he has said. Platter has remarked that his work is an expanded form of printmaking. He is inspired by the stark idiom of black-and-white linocut, in particular the prints of John Muafangejo.
