Active Object is a painting on canvas wrapped precisely around a long, rectangular piece of wood. Installed perpendicular to the wall, the work is meant to be seen on both sides by the viewer. Because of the active connection it creates between the duration of the gaze and the movement of the body, Active Object is a landmark in the connection of art to phenomenology—the study of objective reality as experienced by the individual. The artist explored the tension between formal stability and instability, conceiving it to be an agent of perceptual activation of the borders and volumes of the visual field. As such, the Active Objects series is not only a milestone in the history of hard–edge abstraction, but also a striking precedent to Minimalism.
