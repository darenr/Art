The XO is the first generation of an inexpensive computer conceived by One Laptop per Child, a nonprofit program begun at the MIT Media Lab, and it is designed to be distributed by governments and nongovernmental organizations to schools all over the globe. XO is made to be the size of a textbook and lighter than a lunchbox. Many of its features serve at least two purposes: the Wi-Fi antennas double as covers for the USB ports, for instance, while the handle serves also as an attachment point for a strap and the protective bumper also seals to protect from dust. The screen has both a full-color mode and a reflective high-resolution mode that makes it readable in bright sunlight, and a wide track pad doubles as a drawing and writing tablet. If electricity is not available, the computer can be recharged by a pull cord that works like a yo-yo.
