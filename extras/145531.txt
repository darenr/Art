Since 2005 Felton has produced a yearly report on his life's quantifiable experiences, adding an r to his last name to make it sound more "corporate." For example, his 2009 report is extensive, containing information provided by every person with whom the designer had a substantial face-to-face encounter. The information, collected via online survey, forms a database of his personality and habits, from facts (where he went, what he drank) to more subjective material (his mood). People in 179 distinct relationships with Felton, such as his dentist, ex-wife, and grill master, reported their perceptions of his state of mind: "Earnestly industrious," "Unhurried and relaxed," and "Pensive (but not in a lame way)." Felton has recently launched a website that allows anyone to collect their own personal data in a similar fashion.
