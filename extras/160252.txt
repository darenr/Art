Emma with the Long Neck, the second monotype depicting the sitter Emma Laforge to enter the collection, was originally a gift from the artist to the American art historian Walter Pach, an important early advocate of Matisse's work. Pach first met Matisse around 1907, in Paris. Over the next several years he became a key connection between the artist and New York City, organizing some of Matisse's first gallery exhibitions here and helping to develop his growing American collector base.
