Biophilia—a hybrid software application (app) and music album with interactive graphics, animations, and musical scoring—reflects Björk’s interest in a collaborative process that in this case not only included other artists, designers, engineers, and musicians, but also invites engagement from the people that download and play the app/album. Upon opening the program, players encounter a galaxy punctuated with ten songs represented by bright, colorful stars. Touching a star launches a mini- app—a smaller world within the larger Biophilia galaxy—in which one may both listen to and contribute to a song. The interactive graphics and animations of the mini-apps relate directly to the theme of each song.Biophilia means, in its most literal sense, an attraction towards all that is alive and vital in the natural world of plants, animals, and the wider ecosystem. Designing an app as an integral part of the album experience, Björk and her many collaborators on this project have made the connection between nature and the natural, fluid place that technology holds in contemporary life.
