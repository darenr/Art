Picasso created Bull during a period in which he was occupied with making sculptures out of thin planes, both of wood and sheet metal. Bull references painting in its near flatness and, more directly, in its incorporation of a painting stretcher to frame the bull's face. Within this stretcher, the heads of two screws represent the bull's eyes, and a small wooden ball forms its nose. Picasso kept Bull in his own collection; it was not exhibited until after his death.
