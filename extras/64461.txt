Although Winters's work is rooted in abstraction, it is informed by an interest in the structure of biological, architectural, and technological forms. This title page from his first print portfolio combines cellular and geodesic domeâ€“like structures. It displays the influence of a wide range of materials, from natural history illustrations to medical diagrams of neural connections and masses of fertilized and dividing cells. While Winters continues to explore natural and synthetic structural systems, his recent work has often centered around loosely structured grids inspired by microchips, circuitry, and transit maps.Painting, drawing, and printmaking play equally integral roles in his creative practice, and Winters often explores ideas across mediums. Ranking among the most dedicated contemporary printmakers, he works in intaglio, screenprint, linoleum cut, and woodcut, and experiments with new ways of using traditional print mediums. Since Folio Winters has made numerous portfolios, a format that is a fitting vehicle for the serial exploration of themes and images and is well suited to his interest in systems and structures.
