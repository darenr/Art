Chaves and Mantilla, partners in life and work, traveled together in South America to create Dibujando América (Drawing America), a larger project to which this drawing is related. Journeying across Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, Chaves and Mantilla's drawings depicted details they observed, from a place’s built environment to its natural history, while also seeking to capture more ephemeral and evanescent aspects, including light and rain. Though the artists’ styles differ, the drawings are meant to be seen together, showing diverse approaches to place. In this, their project refers to the preconceptions that all travelers bring to the sites they visit, and the work can be seen as an alternative to earlier Latin American travelogues. For the duo, drawing is a form of thinking; both activities are mobile at their core. To draw, they have explained, is “to make a move and that is why we go out and draw while traveling.”
