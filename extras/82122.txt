Rossi, one of Italy’s most famous and influential postwar architects, is among the more important representatives of postmodern architecture. His imaginary cityscapes are marked by an exploration of what he called the “type”: the model or norm. In this painting of a fictional urban landscape, Rossi combines painterly illusion and imagination with a passion for structural and spatial types; symbolic volumes stand in for the functional structures that are integral to city life. His work affirms architecture as an intellectual construct, just as his pure, vernacular forms evoke a city filtered through memory and narratives constructed over time. In the combination of these elements, architecture emerges as a cultural practice capable of offering different layers of meaning to those who use it.
