Makhoba produced this linocut for the portfolio Break the Silence!, to which twenty-one artists contributed. The project was spearheaded by Art for Humanity, an organization that uses visual art to address human rights issues, including the HIV/AIDS pandemic in South Africa. Makhoba presents the acronyms as a theatrical graveyard of letters, utilizing the hard-edged contrast attainable with black-and-white linocut. The composition also appeared on billboards throughout urban and rural areas of South Africa where the incidence of HIV/AIDS is particularly high.
