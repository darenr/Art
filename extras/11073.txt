This book is essentially a theoretical and visual textbook of Suprematism, an abstract style based on simple geometric shapes against a white background that Malevich pioneered in 1915. These reductive geometries seem to be the product of extremely rational thinking, but Malevichâ€™s writings confirm that ultimately he was seeking a strong spiritual feeling. Describing a painting he had made of a black square, he said, "The square equals feeling, the white background equals nothingness."
