The portfolio format has always had a central position in Winters's printed work, allowing him to extend his systemic thinking into natural series. At Bill Goldston's suggestion Winters tried etching in 1988 and completed this unusual portfolio the following year. Using different etching techniques he contrasts photographic and hand-drawn modes of image-making, setting up oppositional pairs: figurative versus abstract, human versus celestial, and interior versus exterior.
