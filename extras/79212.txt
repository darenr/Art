In the late 1960s Buren devised a signature visual device: alternating colored and white stripes, each exactly 8.7 centimeters wide (about 3.5 inches), the standard for stripes on commercial awning fabric.  Buren's "paintings" began to appear not only in art contexts but also in urban locationsâ€”on walls of buildings, in store windows, and in subway stations.  In 1977 Buren cut up one of his artworks from 1969 and made a new work, designating that the sections should hang in the corners of a wall, whether that wall was empty, had doors or windows, or even had other artworks hanging on it.
