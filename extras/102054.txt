Nicolai selected the colors for this project from the thousands of hues standardized by Pantone, an international company that specializes in color and whose products are widely used in the fields of art and design. He is fascinated by the effects standardization has had on artistic practice and by functional applications of color in everyday life. Nicolai encourages the owners of this print project to devise their own patterns for installation.
