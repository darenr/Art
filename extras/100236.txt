New Yorkâ€“based artist John Duff works primarily in sculptural relief, and his wall sculptures require a unique casting process. For Reciprocating Wedge, the artist constructed a hollow mold out of plywood, painted the inside of the mold with orange paint, and then filled it with the mixture of fiberglass and resin that would become the sculpture. The paint inside the mold gave the sculpture its orange color, and the bits of natural wood are pieces of the mold that stuck to the resin during the casting process.
