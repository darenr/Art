Kiesler, an architect, set designer, artist, and philosopher, began to explore "endless" architectural space in 1922, and he continued to develop this theme throughout his career. The biomorphic Endless House is Kiesler's vision of a free-form, continuous, human-centered living space synthesizing painting, sculpture, architecture, and the environment. Designed in direct opposition to the static, rectilinear rooms of the sterile boxes that were beginning to dominate modern architecture in the 1950s, this house, he said, was to be "endless like the human bodyâ€”there is no beginning and no end." He saw this womblike form as related to female anatomy; others see an egg, or even the human heart, with the different rooms as aortic chambers.
