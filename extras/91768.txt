Towards the late 1960s Gego conceived the environmental wire sculptures that she called Reticuláreas. Fundamentally geometric, these weblike structures can be configured in an endless number of ways, thereby transforming the exhibition space. Drawing without Paper comes from a series of the same name, created between the mid–1970s and the late 1980s, that consists of three–dimensional metallic structures made of wire, thread, and various found objects. Normally installed close to the wall, casting a shadow, the piece incorporates the space around it by leaving its trace the open field of the gallery. The three–dimensionality of this drawing is related to Greek skiagraphy (shadow writing) and emphasizes the thickness of the lines.
