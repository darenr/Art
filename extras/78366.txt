Kane's 1929 Self–Portrait is considered one of the artist's masterpieces. The portrait is both a shockingly realistic depiction of the male body—veins, chest hair, and all—and an object meant for decorative display, with a frame indicated around the image edges and painted arches defining the figure's head. Like other self–taught artists in this exhibition, Kane produced most of his work in a concentrated period of time—the last seven years of his life.
