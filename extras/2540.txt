Always striving for what he called the "optimal object," Franck reduced forms to their most basic iterations in the interest of enhanced function, affordability, and anonymity. The Kilta kitchen and tablewares are among his most celebrated designs. Each piece in this monochromatic series (produced in white, black, green, blue, and yellow) is meant to perform a range of functions—from food preparation to serving and even storage. Franck veered away from tradition by removing unnecessary handles, reshaping spouts, and designing lids to fit multiple pieces. The service attracted international attention and was manufacturer Arabia’s most popular model for more than twenty years.
