Zorach's sculpture depicts a favorite subject of his, his daughter Dahlov, embracing one of the family's cats. Carved from Tennessee marble, the work retains a sense of the weight and mass of the stone. Zorach allowed his materials to help shape his composition, with his chosen form seeming to emerge organically from them. "Real sculpture is something monumental," he once said, "something hewn from solid mass, something with repose, with inner and outer form, with strength and power."
