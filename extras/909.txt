In the late 1960s, an expressway running across lower Manhattan, linking New Jersey to Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island via the Holland Tunnel and the Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges, was under discussion. Paul Rudolph's proposed Y-shaped corridor was designed to leave the city's infrastructure intact, and suggested a new approach to city building, which claimed that transportation networks could bind rather than divide communities. At key points in the "transportation corridor" (central hub, bridge or tunnel entries) there were multilevel, stacking pedestrian plazas, people movers, and parkingâ€”all above and below existing bridge and rail systems. Tall, stepped-back residential buildings would provide light, air, and views, flanking the corridor at these gateways, and in conjunction with new building types, could become generators of urban space.
