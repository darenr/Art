The title comes from the 1960 Ray Charles/Betty Carter hit Murray listened to while painting this work. The imagery within the jumbled and interrupted maze is at once comic and abject, recognizable and uncanny—an overturned bottle, faces, bodies, and organs, as well as references to the paintings of Joan Miró and Pablo Picasso. Unlike these painters, who applied paint to flat canvases, Murray describes her process as "a construction." "The painting comes to me in pieces and it goes up on the wall," she has said.
