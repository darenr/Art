The Kilta Tableware service is one of the most famous works of this celebrated Finnish designer. Always aiming for what he called the "optimal object," Franck reduced forms to their most basic iterations in the interest of enhanced function, affordability, and anonymity. Each piece in this monochromatic series (produced in white, black, green, blue, and yellow) is meant to serve a wide range of purposesâ€”from food preparation to serving and even storage. Franck veered away from tradition in removing unnecessary handles, reshaping spouts, and designing lids to fit multiple pieces. The service attracted international attention and was Arabia's most popular model for more than twenty years.
