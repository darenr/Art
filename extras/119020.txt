A deep fascination with mathematics and geometric relationships informs Rockburneâ€™s work. For this project she folded the sheets of paper on which the prints were made before they were run through the press so that the edges and folds would create embossed lines. Aquatint, which appears as a velvety off-white against the white paper, was printed on the portions of paper that were topmost after the paper was folded.
