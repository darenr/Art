This clear-cut, angular chair was produced in collaboration with the German company BASF using a single-injected piece of Ultradur High Speed, an advanced plastic usually reserved for the automotive industry. The plasticâ€™s molecular characteristics and its strength allow for a sleek transition from thick to thin cross sections and thus for the cantilever that makes the chair so distinctive.
