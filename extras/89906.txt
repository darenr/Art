Created with pencil, gouache, and stamps on kraft paper, Dittborn's landmark Airmail paintings of the early 1980s were normally folded and mailed in large envelopes to various artistic venues. The creases in this work were created by the constant folding and unfolding of the large sheet of paper throughout its journey, underlining the physical quality of passing time. By repeating the icon of a house in each compartment, Dittborn highlights the concept of a transient place, where one is in constant arrival and departure.
