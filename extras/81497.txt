Four years working on the railroad, according to the artist, "completely tore me away from the pretensions of art, even my own, and I was back on the horizontal lines of steel and rust." With systems of regular units, Andre rejected the notion of sculpture mounted on a pedestal and viewed from a distance. His desire "to make something to be in the world" is realized by the fact that this sculpture can be inadvertently or purposefully walked on. However, recent research into the properties of lead compels the Museum to caution visitors against stepping on this work.
