"La Villette had to be built: . . . the finality of each drawing was 'building."
—Bernard Tschumi  Bernard Tschumi's drawing of the Follies, one of the three components of his winning proposal in the competition for the Parc de la Villette, Paris, in 1982, seems at first glance limited by the architectural-drawing conventions Tschumi eschews in his earlier, theoretical project The Manhattan Transcripts. Evenly dispersed as points in a four-by-four grid, each folly (with the exception of that on the lower right) is represented through an axonometric projection, painted red with gouache. Like The Manhattan Transcripts, the design for Parc de la Villette employs three autonomous systems: points, lines, and surfaces. Superimposed over the 125-acre expanse, each system also corresponds to the architectural method of disjuncture that Tschumi applied in the earlier work: points equal events; lines correspond to systems of movement; and surfaces are equivalent to systems of space. The Follies are the points, or pointlike activities, distributed evenly at 120-meter intervals. Each is a permutation on the same basic 10-by-10-cubic-meter frame. Where Zaha M. Hadid's proposal for the park can be understood through the simultaneity of a vertical section, Tschumi's tripartite system introduces a cinematic quality, or an order of time and sequence, into the landscape. Meaning is derived through the order of experience rather than the order of structure, as one's experience is conditioned by one's movement. Each Folly becomes an isolated frame within which space, movement, and events are contracted and between which architecture occurs. Drawn in 1986, four years after Tschumi made his initial proposal, the Follies read here like built objects in the landscape—static, sculptural forms. Yet as one's eye jumps from point to point and passes from medium to medium, the drawing, like the park, is constructed through movement. Red ink and red and white gouache painted over the white line of the photographic image become interchangeable notation systems in which the event forms the backdrop.Originally from TextEntryID 73728 (TextTypeID 133)removed references to manhattan transcripts...(see 3.1995.2, 3.1995.4, 7.1995.8, 9.1995.3)removed references to Zaha M.
