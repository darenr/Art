"There is no royal road to food conservation. It can be accomplished only though sincere and earnest daily cooperation in the 20,000,000 kitchens and at the 20,000,000 dinner tables of the United States." This was Herbert Hoover's message to the press the day Food Control (an emergency wartime measure to conserve food supplies) was signed into U.S. law, in August 1917. Government agencies have long informed and shaped the trajectory of the modern kitchen through propaganda campaigns, which have historically sought to influence consumer behavior, as well as through taxation, building codes, and health and safety legislation.
