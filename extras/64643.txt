In this radical lithograph, her first, Smith used imprints and photocopies of her own hair, face, and neck, along with a "Cher" wig, to create a wild, dynamic linear web. This print was one of the first in which she used her own body as part of the printmaking process. It signaled the uniquely inventive and sculptural approach that would characterize much of Smith's work at ULAE.
