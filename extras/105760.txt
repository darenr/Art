Yuskavage gained recognition in the late 1990s for opulently painted, provocative depictions of naked young women. She is among the new generation of artists ULAE director Bill Goldston has invited to the studio in recent years and her virtuoso draftsmanship has fostered her creativity with lithography. In this elaborate color work she pushes the medium beyond its conventional boundaries, layering additional printed and hand-drawn elements. In haunting, surreal tonalities that suggest the changing moods of its waiflike subject, this ethereal and dreamlike image exudes a muted eroticism, heightened by the enveloping fertile landscape.
