Gorky created three paintings titled Garden in Sochi. Like the others, this, the earliest example, features an abstract composition inspired by the artist’s childhood memories of his native Armenia. Shortly after MoMA acquired the work in 1942, Gorky wrote to the Museum explaining the imagery: “My father had a little garden with a few apple trees which had retired from giving fruit. There was a ground constantly in shade where grew incalculable amounts of wild carrots, and porcupines had made their nests.” Like many of his peers Gorky was interested in exploring mythic subject matter in his work; uniquely, he located these themes in his personal history.
