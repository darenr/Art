Weber said that he wanted “to put the abstract into concrete terms,” and this arrangement of triangular planes and sharp angles in polychrome plaster is one of the earliest examples of abstraction in sculpture. Weber was an American who from 1905 through 1908 lived in Paris, where he saw early Cubist art featuring fractured planes and multiple viewpoints. Upon his return to New York, he helped to introduce the innovations of the European avant-garde to American artists.
