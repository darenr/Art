Private and discreet and yet able to deliver a powerful jolt, this alarm is very useful for commuters and for people who want to take a small, private nap. The alarm fits comfortably around and into the ear. The two buttons set the waking time at increments of five and thirty minutes. At the determined time, the alarm vibrates against the wearers auricular pavilion, inside the ear.
