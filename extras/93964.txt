Every twenty minutes, someone somewhere is killed or mutilated by a land mine. No one knows exactly how many mines lie in the soil of countries such as Angola, Somalia, Afghanistan, Mozambique, Cambodia, Bosnia, Croatia, and Kosovo; estimates range from sixty to a hundred million.MIMID's lightweight and collapsible design makes it suitable for metal-mine detection in remote areas with limited logistical support. The six–pound battery-powered unit can be carried on a waist belt or in a pocket and can be set up in less than thirty seconds. Operator training requires only a few minutes, which makes it a valuable asset—a first-aid kit of sorts—for humanitarian organizations.
