Banner refers to her Table Stops as “abstract points of focus.” Sleek black objects reminiscent of paperweights on an executive’s desk, these forms are based on punctuation marks (periods, or full stops) as they appear in a range of fonts: Klang, Slipstream, Avant-Garde, Nuptial, Formata, Optical, and Courier. The marks, transformed into three dimensions and enlarged at the same scale, have no fixed arrangement; presented together, they enact what the artist has called “a silent conversation.”
