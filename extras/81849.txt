This highly stylized figure balances on a cagelike throne which, together with the pillory–like board covering her shins, simultaneously supports and restrains her from movement. Her hands, positioned as if holding or offering something, hold nothing, as suggested by the work’s title. Giacometti modeled the figure’s head and face after a protective metal mask. This is Giacometti’s first large–scale, anatomically complete human figure, and his last major work made within the orbit of Surrealism.
