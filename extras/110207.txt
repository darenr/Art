The International Development Center at Adam Opel GmbH, General Motorsâ€™ German subsidiary, has developed three-dimensional optimization software that mimics biological growth. Originally designed for automotive chassis components, the software has been applied by Laarman to the design of furniture. In a transfer of design from the natural world to a man-made object, this chair is based on the generative process of bones. As bones grow, areas exposed to high stress develop the most mass, for strength. Doing away with the superfluous results in an optimized structure that performs with the least amount of material.
