In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Gilbert & George were among the artists creating alternatives to traditional painting and sculpture. Donning conservative business suits, they became "living sculpture," giving performances and generally considering everything they did to be an artwork. They often poke fun at proper behavior in a deadpan fashion and include references to drunkenness, sexuality, and other bodily functions.
