Wojnarowicz was a prominent artist, writer, musician, and activist in downtown New York in the 1980s and 1990s. Inspired by the language of Pop art, this drawing is from a series of works based on supermarket advertisements and comic strip vignettes, and invoking illness, eroticism, and death. Wojnarowicz considered his art practice to be closely related to his music, and he was a member of the postpunk band 3 Teens Kill 4 (3TK4).
