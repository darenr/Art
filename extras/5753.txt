Radio stations can reflect both local culture and particular genres of music. In this poster advertising WQXR, the oldest commercial classical radio station in the United States, based in New York, Silverstein brought a new light touch to the once staid world of classical music. It matched the informal presentation style and mildly irreverent wit of radio host Lloyd Moss, who began his long association with the station in 1954. As art director of the promotion department at the New York Times, the company that owned the station, Silverstein applied consistent graphic standards to modernizing the image of both WQXR and the newspaper.
