Maquiladora is the result of a decade of research by Cruz into the border between the wealthy sprawl of suburban San Diego, California, and the ad hoc, scrappy shantytowns of Tijuana, Mexico. It is a scaffolding system that will allow Tijuana to achieve a greater level of density, a quality Cruz sees as essential to maintaining order in an urban setting already approaching entropy. The scaffolding functions as a frame upon which milk crates, tires, sheets of corrugated metal, rammed earth, and cinder blocks can be arranged, with a particular emphasis on vertical development. Cruz offers the simple modular and rapidly deployable scaffolding system but leaves the rest of the work and design up to the users.
