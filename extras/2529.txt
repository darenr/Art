Gehry’s interest in industrial materials—such as chainlink, plywood, and corrugated metal—is well represented in his early projects. He first used corrugated cardboard in his Easy Edges furniture collection, introduced in 1972. As the material wears, it becomes suedelike, malleable, and soft. The Bubbles Chaise Longue belongs to Experimental Edges, a second collection, introduced in 1979. Gehry’s intention was to make durable furnishings from throwaway material “to suit the homes of young as well as old, of urban sophisticates as well as country dwellers,” he has said.
