Imagined for a site on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, this is one of a number of important theoretical works Denari designed in the 1990s. Devoid of human figures or greenery, the drawing portrays a highly technological vision of architecture produced, ironically, not by machine but laboriously by hand. The heavy shadowing and stark surfaces suggest both the anxiety and the euphoria of the twentieth-century relationship with the machine, a love-hate dynamic still evident today. Denari’s project portrays the moment when the two worlds merge—when, in the words of Italian author Italo Calvino, “The iron machines still exist, but they obey the orders of weightless bits.”
