Over the course of two years, Winters produced Schema, a series of seventy–five works on paper based in part on illustrations of scientific, natural, and mathematical phenomena. Using a range of mediums including graphite, oilstick, gouache, and watercolor, he abstracted from these source images, trusting chance and the properties of his materials to guide the creation of his loosely referential forms. Winters explored new technical possibilities in Schema, creating juxtapositions of composition, color, and scale that served as a foundation for later works. The series debuted at Sonnabend Gallery in 1987, all seventy–five works displayed across the entirety of the space.
