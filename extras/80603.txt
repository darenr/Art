This painting takes its cues from an eighteenth–century British portrait by George Engleheart of the singer and actress Mrs. Isabella Mills, humorously recast by Miró’s title as "Mistress" rather than "Mrs." The figure and background are painted in vivid hues, which fundamentally differ from the naturalistically rendered forms in the original portrait. As with the Dutch Interiors, here Miró rejected the naturalism of his source imagery, aggressively simplifying and distorting it.
