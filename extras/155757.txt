The XO Laptop is an inexpensive computer for children in the developing world. It was specifically adapted to the needs and habits of children: it is the size of a textbook and lighter than a lunch box, with soft edges, a handle, and a rubber keyboard; it is recyclable, drop-proof, splash-proof, and dustproof; it can be manually recharged; and its wireless antennae resemble playful rabbit ears. More than seven hundred thousand of these laptops, many of them equipped with the innovative and child-friendly interface Sugar, have been distributed to schools in Argentina, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Ethiopia, Libya, Mexico, Mongolia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, Romania, Rwanda, Thailand, and Uruguay. A newer model, XOXO, was developed with feedback from children and released in 2010.
