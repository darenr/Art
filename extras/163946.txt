Bruno is a portrait of the artist's eldest son at age ten. With his arms outstretched, the figure calls to mind a saint—possibly Bartholomew, a martyr who was flayed and is typically portrayed holding his skin. By using organic materials that are subject to degradation, Althamer has evaded the timeless quality associated with traditional fine art and religious sculpture. Althamer began the work in the 1990s and completed it in 2012 with the assistance of his son—now an adult—who is also an artist.
