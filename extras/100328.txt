Judith Shea trained as a fashion designer before turning to fine art, and traces of her first profession are visible in her use of clothing. The hollow interior and low placement of Crawl, which takes its name from the swimming stroke, invite the viewer to imagine a swimmer within the bathing suit, and according to the artist's instructions, the pedestal on which Crawl lies is large enough to accommodate the body of the theoretical swimmer. With this work, Shea alludes to the centurieslong tradition of heroic bronze sculpture, but subverts it by suggesting the figure's absence and positioning the work horizontally.
