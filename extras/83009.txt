In 1911 Wright began to experiment with prefabrication in hundreds of drawings, culminating in the publication of American System-Built Houses. The plans in this folio illustrate different ways of configuring standardized building components that were to be precut in an off-site factory. His system incorporated built-in storage and work surfaces in the kitchens, which he conceived as part of the prefabricated whole. Despite a marketing campaign, there was little interest in the scheme, and very few of the proposed plans were realized.
