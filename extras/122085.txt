The five sequences that compose autoreverse show decomposing and recomposing machines made from electric appliances. RS 570, X1, 97 C, FHW 64 D, and AM A202 unfold and reassemble, accompanied by what Kirps calls “electro-techno-mechanic” sounds, to reveal their surreal and redundant functions. “For autoreverse, I initially searched for elements to recycle,” the designer has explained. “I collected an enormous stockpile of objects, which I then photographed from every angle.” Among the accumulations are pieces of household and office equipment, much of it now obsolete.
