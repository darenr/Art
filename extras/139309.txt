Mantinia is a display and titling typeface designed to complement Galliard, an earlier typeface also designed by Carter. It was inspired by the writing of Italian renaissance painter and printmaker Andrea Mantegna, a historical revivalist enamored of ancient Roman inscriptions carved in stone. Mantinia is an all-capital typeface, with a set of small capitals and unusual ligatures (conjoined pairs of letters) that reference the stonecutter's craft.
