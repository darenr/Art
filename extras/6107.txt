In 1929 the first working conference of CIAM (Congrès International d’Architecture Moderne) was held in Frankfurt, focusing international attention on the city’s ambitious housing program. This poster advertised an exhibition about attempts to define the minimum habitable dwelling that featured plans submitted by modernist delegates from many different countries, all drawn to the same scale. Ernst May’s minimalist floor plan for houses on Frankfurt’s Praunheim estate, which included the standardized, built-in features of a tiny kitchen designed by Grete Schütte-Lihotzky, was selected as a paradigm of the conference’s theme.
