Yaunerâ€™s exit sign is controlled by a motion sensor. When people are moving near the sign, it functions as a standard static emergency-exit sign. However, when there is no motion near the sign, the overworked pictogram takes a break from running and participates in a number of activities, from watching TV to taking a nap. By animating the stationary running man we see every day and usually ignore, Yauner gives the exit sign a life of its own and challenges the viewer to notice and observe ordinary objects.
