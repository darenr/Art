Yuskavage's paintings recall the airbrushed and fantasized female bodies found in popular culture. Here a prim schoolgirl (in a picture seemingly tacked on the wall at upper left) contrasts with the exaggerated pinup girl.  In discussing her work, the artist has expressed complex feelings about her own "self-deprecation, social climbing, and constant longing for perfection."
