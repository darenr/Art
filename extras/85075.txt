For the 1938 Ballet Caravan production (premiere Hartford, Connecticut). Choreography by Lew Christensen. Music by Virgil Thomson. Book by Lincoln Kirstein Filling Station was a keystone in the uniquely American repertory of Lincoln Kirstein's concert group, the Ballet Caravan. Founded in 1936, the Caravan represented one in a series of companies that eventually led to Kirstein's establishment of the New York City Ballet. In 1941 the company merged with American Ballet to become the American Ballet Caravan, a  touring group that brought homegrown themes to audiences in South America. Filling Station, which concerns a gas-station attendant's run-ins with various patrons, received rave reviews in the United States and abroad. The ballet's subject matter allowed Cadmus to further explore themes seen in his fineâ€“art practice: the eroticized male body and views of everyday American life.
