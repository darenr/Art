The Vertigo of Eros is what Matta called an “inscape,” one of a series of imaginary landscapes he conceived of as projections of his psyche. In 1939, to escape the war in Europe, Matta emigrated from Paris to New York, where he stayed until 1948. His use of spontaneous, unplanned “automatic” drawing and his interest in mysticism, evident in paintings such as this, had a tremendous influence on many New York–based artists. Together with other Surrealists in exile, he quickly made acquaintance with painters, including Jackson Pollock. “We spoke of automatism,” Matta recalled. “The New Yorkers became aware of these things through contact with us, although, as in a Chaplin movie, we had arrived utterly lost.”
