Since the 1960s, Nauman has experimented with mediums as diverse as video, holography, and neon. This untitled work is the final piece in a series of fiberglass wall sculptures he made in 1965, while still a graduate student at the University of California, Davis. Nauman constructed a mold out of wood and cardboard, then brushed on a layer of fiberglass resin mixed with pigment and glitter. Removed from the mold and illuminated from within by an incandescent lightbulb, the translucent surface (with some wood and cardboard still adhering) seems to flicker and glow. Nauman has said that he enjoyed the process of making fiberglass works—“not knowing what it’s going to be like when you’re finished. You try it out, and then you see what you’ve got, and then you decide if that’s what you want to do or not.”
