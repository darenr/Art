Wind Map is an online application that pulls information from the public National Digital Forecast database maintained by the National Weather Service; its near-term forecasts, revised once per hour, are precise within a range of two square miles. The time stamp shows the time of download. In the designers’ words, Wind Map is a “living portrait” of the wind landscape over the United States: “An invisible, ancient source of energy surrounds usenergy that powered the first explorations of the world, and that may be a key to the future,” they have written. Wind Map creates arrestingly beautiful patterns but also useful visualizations of data that can be analyzed in various ways.
