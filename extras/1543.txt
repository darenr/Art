The geometry of the Pyramat Erosion Mat helps stabilize soil and bolster vegetation even on the roughest of terrains. This three-dimensional woven geotextile matrix is made of polypropylene monofilament yarns woven into a uniform design of pyramid-like cells. The mat interlocks and strengthens vegetative root systems, naturally reinforcing the soil and protecting the surface against erosion.
