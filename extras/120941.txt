The Cabbage Chair is a response to a challenge from fashion designer Issey Miyake to create an application for the heaps of paper that are a by-product of the fabric-pleating process used in many of his designs. The Cabbage Chair “appears naturally” as layers of a roll of this paper, stiffened and made resilient by added resins, are peeled back. Its rough appearance contrasts with its comfort, and the reuse of materials and minimal production and distribution costs—the chair requires minimal packaging—make it a valuable addition to the evolving debate on design and sustainability.
