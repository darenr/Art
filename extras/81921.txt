In 1967–68, Serra made Verb List Compilation: Actions to Relate to Oneself, an inventory of actions that could be employed in making sculpture—“to roll,” “to crease,” and “to fold,” for example—upon which he based a number of later works. Cutting Device: Base Plate-Measure is based on the action “to cut” and is a visual record of its meaning. Serra collected a variety of materials—rolled lead sheets, wood beams, marble slabs, and steel piping—and then used a saw to make two slices through the assembled objects. The sculpture comprises the severed objects, arranged as they appeared directly after having been cut.
