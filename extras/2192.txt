"The seats were a kind of wave which curved down, surged up, and fell once more, thus forming an object without beginning or end," said Kiesler of his Multi-use Chairs, "and in its convex curves the body could take ease." Art collector Peggy Guggenheim hired the former stage designer to design her gallery on West 57th Street, which opened in 1942. Kiesler designed these chairs—constructed for seven dollars each in the Bronx—to fill the unconventional spaces he created for Guggenheim's collection of Post-Impressionist and Surrealist art. The Surrealist-inspired "rest-forms" were meant to be versatile; Kiesler delineated eighteen uses for them, including seating and stands for the display of objects. Their amorphous and organic shape demonstrates Kiesler's experimentation with "continuous tension."
