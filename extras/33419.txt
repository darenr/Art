Mondrian's abstracted pier—the vertical lines at the base of the oval—stretches into an ocean of short lines and crosses that suggest flickering light on the surface of water. The artist forged his approach to abstraction through Cubism, which he encountered during the two years he lived in Paris, from 1912 to 1914. He said, "I wish to approach truth as closely as is possible, and therefore I abstract everything until I arrive at the fundamental quality of objects."
