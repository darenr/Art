Since the late 1970s Holzer has used text as her primary artistic vehicle.  Many works have had a public presence; her pithy, ironic, and often disturbing statements have been presented on posters, T-shirts, baseball caps, and a flashing screen in Times Square, New York. In the Living series, she has adopted the bronze plaque in order "to have the look of a voice of authority, of the establishment," she has said.
