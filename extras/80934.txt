Early visitors to Picasso's studio were bewildered by this work: "What is that?" they asked, according to the poet Andr√© Salmon: "Does that rest on a pedestal? Does that hang on the wall? Is it a painting or sculpture?" Apparently, Picasso responded, "It's nothing, it's 'la guitare!'" For Salmon, one of Picasso's closest friends during the Cubist years, the effect was of radical importance: "We were delivered from painting and sculpture, liberated from the imbecilic tyranny of genres." With its center open to space, Picasso's Guitar was a radical breakthrough.
