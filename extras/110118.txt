Stupía's work represents a tradition of draftmanship in Argentina with precedents such as artists León Ferrari (born 1920) and Luis Felipe Noé (born 1933). This drawing is a landmark in Stupía's work of the mid–1980s, when his stylistic approach was unanimously celebrated in Argentina. One of his typical imaginary landscapes, it features an extremely controlled and complex composition in which the artist obsessively traced linear contours to create an almost imperceptible weblike structure.  Stupía's interest in Oriental calligraphy is evident in this labyrinthine landscape's emphasis on gestural lines and the materiality and liquidity of ink.
