Lautrec is said to have gone twenty times to see the singer and dancer Marcelle Lender in an 1895 revival of the Hervé operetta Chilpéric. When his friend Romain Coolus, who could stand to accompany him only six of those times, asked what the attraction was, he replied, “I only come to see Lender’s back. Look carefully, you will rarely see anything as splendid.” However, only one of the twelve lithographs that resulted from this burst of theater-going depicts Lender from behind.
