In the 1940s and 1950s Blauvelt created some eight hundred drawings on looseâ€“leaf notebook paper and found materials. She appropriated imagery from shopping catalogues and illustrated furniture, clothing, and architecture from her everyday life. Blauvelt drew using her own flattened perspective and organized her selections through careful classifications, enhanced by a methodical layering of line.
