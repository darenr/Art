In Designs for Independent Living, a 1988 MoMA exhibition of therapeutic and assistive products, more than half of the forty-five works displayed were Scandinavian. Sweden was strongly represented by Ergonomi Design, a pioneer of inclusive design founded by Maria Benktzon and Sven-Eric Juhlin. Among the firmâ€™s projects in the exhibition was this mug designed by Juhlin, an example of conceiving design for children based on their needs and comfort rather than simply miniaturizing adult products. Since 1969 Ergonomi has specialized in progressive user-oriented design and demonstrated a commitment to equality as well as quality of life, design principles for which the Nordic countries are still known.
