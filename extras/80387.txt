The artist, Moscow and Petrograd/Leningrad. 1916 - 1927 Hugo Haering, Berlin, 1927 - 1930.  Malevich took approximately seventy works, including this one, from Leningrad to Berlin in 1927, where the work was displayed at Gro√üe Berliner Austellung.  Malevich left these paintings and drawings in the care of a Berlin Architect named Hugo Haering when he returned to Leningrad later in 1927.  In 1930, Haering transferred the collection to the care of Alexander Dorner, director of the Provinzialmuseum in Hannover.  Malevich never returned to Germany to collect the works, and died in Leningrad in 1935 without leaving instructions directing the disposition of his art.   Provinzialmuseum (later Landesmuseum), Hannover, 1930 - 1935.  Dorner exhibited the pictures until the Nazis came to power in 1933, and then placed them in storage to save them from possible destruction.  In 1935, Alfred Barr, acting on behalf of The Museum of Modern Art, bought two paintings and two drawings from Dorner, and borrowed other works.  The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1935 - present.  The works remained on extended loan to The Museum of Modern Art until 1963, when they were acquired into the collection.  The acquisition was confirmed in 1999 by agreement with Malevich's heirs and made possible with funds from the Mrs. John Hay Whitney Bequest (by exchange).
