Of her politically charged paintings and drawings, the British-born artist Sue Coe has said, "My dream is that people donâ€™t discuss the work, but discuss the content." Coe, who has created editorial cartoons for the op-ed page of The New York Times, has addressed in her artwork such subjects as racism, sexism, and the mistreatment of children.
