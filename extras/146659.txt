Whiteread's drawings are not exact plans for her three-dimensional projects, but they also focus on the spare elegance of overlooked details and objects that surround us. "Drawings help me choreograph a space, in terms of placing something or making something work within a space, in doing that with line on a page first," she has explained. Typically executed on graph paper, they often feature white correction fluidâ€”a medium she prefers because it is viscous and yet translucent and its matte finish resembles the plaster she uses in much of her work.
