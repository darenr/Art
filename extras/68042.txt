Mythical characters first appeared in Picasso's work in his Neoclassical period, of the late 1910s and 1920s, and also in the 1930s, under the influence of Surrealism. They could symbolize harmony and serenity or irrational thought. After World War II, when in the South of France, Picasso often depicted fauns and satyrs, as if that locale, steeped in ancient history, prompted them. He once remarked, "It is strange, in Paris I never draw fauns, centaurs, or mythical heroes . . . they always seem to live in these parts."
