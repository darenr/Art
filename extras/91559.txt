Composed of 110 individually printed sheets, this monumental work is a complex technical achievement. A drawing by Kentridge was divided up and transferred in pieces to 110 metal printing plates, then each plate was printed on unbound pages from a 1950 edition of Chambers's Encyclopedia. Featuring an Egyptian temple, stage machinery, and a falcon, as well as familiar Kentridge motifs—including a lightbulb, megaphone, and camera—the composition resonates with Mozart's opera The Magic Flute (1791), which Kentridge directed in 2005, and, given its grand scale, invokes the space of the theater.
