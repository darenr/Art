Repetition Nineteen, III comprises nineteen bucketlike forms, all the same shape but none exactly alike. Like many artists of her generation, Hesse explored repetition as a compositional strategy. However, rather than relying on the strict, hard-edged geometry of Minimalism, she deployed softer, handmade forms. This work is made of translucent industrial fiberglass, one of the artistâ€™s favorite materials.
