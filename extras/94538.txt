The LifePort Kidney Transporter provides an alternative to the standard cooler-and-ice method of organ storage and transportation. The perfusion system, housed in a case light enough for one person to carry, pumps the kidney with a liquid solution to improve its condition prior to transplantation, doubling its storage life and increasing the quality an quantity of available organs for transplant. There are almost 100,000 Americans in need of a kidney transplant; this device can potentially remove tens of thousands of patients from the waiting list and save the health-care system more than $1 billion annually.
