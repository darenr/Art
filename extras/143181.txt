Artificial Biological Clock addresses the contentious subject of modern reproductive technology. In vitro fertilization and related methods, Cohen has explained, are making it hard to retain a realistic view of how long a woman may put off pregnancy. The designer contrasts nature and artifice by highlighting the contemporary social pressures and expectations that dictate a woman’s reproductive vitality rather than her natural body rhythms. “Along with the growing pressure to develop a career,” she has said, habits of modern life are “distorting the body’s reproductive signals.” A woman no longer in touch with her body’s rhythms could rely on the Artificial Biological Clock to remind her of her fertility’s “temporary and fragile nature.” The clock is fed information by her doctor, therapist, and bank manager via an online service. When these complex factors align perfectly, the clock lets her know that she is ready to have a child.
