Mac Low, known more as a poet, a composer of performance pieces, and a performer than as a composer of music, was a student in Cageâ€™s Experimental Music Composition classes at the New School for Social Research and an important figure in the early avant-garde circles in New York, including Fluxus. Mac Low also had a passionate concern for social justice, as can be seen his Social Project works, which were written in response to what he felt were negative approaches to social concerns by other Fluxus members.
