Harvey Quaytman often made his own paints and repeatedly experimented with a form consisting of crossed lines. According to the artist, the cruciform did not have a sacred or symbolic meaning; rather, he saw it as the logical product of the overlapping lines of squares and rectangles. Quaytman saw his work as small triumphs, "inch by inch and year by year, over the arbitrary chaos of visual life."
