The minimalist composition of this poster deploys flat blocks of saturated color and a succinct grouping of rectangles to evoke a modernist urban skyline. Its design reflects the influence of modernist Max Bill, with whom Vieira studied after moving to Switzerland from Brazil in 1951. She also created a three–dimensional relief of the poster at the entrance of the Zurich museum and was one of the Brazilian artists and architects included in the exhibition. At that time Vieira was one of the few women to achieve success in the male–dominated profession of graphic design: this poster was hailed as the best of the year in Switzerland and awarded the Diplôme d’Honneur du Département Fédéral de l’Intérieur.
