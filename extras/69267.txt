Picasso met Surrealist photographer Dora Maar in the winter of 1935–36 and the two were lovers until the early 1940s, through the turmoil of the Spanish Civil War and the outbreak of World War II. In addition to her involvement in Surrealist circles, Maar was active in leftist political causes. Her volatile personality was well–known; Picasso called her his "weeping woman."This image, associated with  Maar, may also reference Picasso's former lover, Marie–Thérèse Walter, and Olga Picasso, to whom he was still married. In addition, it expresses his despair during the Spanish Civil War; it was made in conjunction with his celebrated painting Guernica (1937).
