The light from the LEDs hidden in the mound of concrete that forms the base of this lamp travels along the acrylic rod as if the latter were a super-sized optical fiber. The rod is bent into the shape of a walking stick to deliver light downward, toward a table or the floor. It provides ambient light as well as a dimmable, focused, directional beam.
