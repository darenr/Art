To make these large drawings, Tottie began by creating a single freehand band of india ink at the top of the sheet. Then, with each subsequent band, she followed the minor inconsistencies of the original, amplifying and exaggerating the irregularities to create a wavelike, abstract pattern across the expanses of the sheets. "In this way," Tottie has explained, "the drawing proceeds by way of the first barely visible, then more and more extreme shifts produced by the previous line." Since the 1990s, Tottie has been experimentingwith generating abstraction through an underlying system or concept.
