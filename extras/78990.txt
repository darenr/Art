Duchamp seemed to intuit immediately that the emergence of abstraction spelled the demise of painting as a craft and its rebirth as an idea. He called 3 Standard Stoppages, for example, "a joke about the meter," and the work exposes the metric system, an originally French set of standards now used throughout the world, as an intellectual construct rather than a universal absolute. Duchamp made the work through the use of chance, dropping three threads, each one meter long, from a height of one meter onto three stretched canvases. He then adhered the threads to the canvases, preserving the curves they had assumed upon landing, and cut the canvases along the threadsâ€™ profiles, creating new units of measure, each in some sense a meter long yet all different and all with an element of the random.
