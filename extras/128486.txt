At eighty-six years old, Picasso embarked on his largest print series, Suite 347, named for the number of sheets it contains. This project, completed in less than seven months, was facilitated by Paris printers Aldo and Piero Crommelynck, who had moved to the South of France to set up an etching workshop near his residence. Wide ranging in its motifs, Suite 347 engages spectacle and theater, as if presenting a stage on which Picasso reviews his life and art.
