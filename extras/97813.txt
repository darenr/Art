Zittel lives and works in the Mojave Desert, where she is engaged with questions of lifestyle, nomadism, and productivity. In addition to drawing she makes furniture, clothes, and "station wagons" that refer to and question traditions of homesteading. This series of gouaches documents her experiments in transforming household waste into decorative wall panels, and they illustrate the artist's relationship with nature. Zittel presents herself as an efficient worker who labors from dusk until dawn, adapting her existence to the structures and colors of the surrounding landscape.
