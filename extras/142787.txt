From 1948 to 1951 Stern contributed weekly photomontages for the column "Psychoanalysis Will Help You" in the Argentinean women's magazine Idilio (Idyll). Edited by sociologist Gino Germani under the pen name Richard Rest, the column provided psychoanalytic views on the dreams of working-class women mobilized to social ascendance by the promises of President Juan Domingo Peron and his second wife, Eva Peron. Behind a layer of playfulness, this photomontage expresses a sense of urgency about giving voice to the hidden desires expressed in women's dreams.
