Simmons expends as much energy erasing his drawings as he does constructing them. After meticulously drafting his pictures he attacks the sketch with his hands clad in thin golf gloves, which allow him to feel the surface and vary the amount of pressure needed to wipe out a drawing without completely destroying it. This wall drawing depicts a cloudburst that carries disquieting associations with war imagery while also re-creating the classic cartoon scenario in which two fighting figures clash and then disappear into an explosion. The blast "is a comedic trope for violence," says Simmons. "Cartoons are the first and earliest form of getting pleasure from a violent act."
