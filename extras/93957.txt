Designed to be a wearable shelter, this parka features forty-four pockets that can store food, medicine, and tools. If the weather gets cold, the pockets can be stuffed with newspaper or any other insulating material. All the pockets can accommodate the optional Final Home down cushions, which transform the parka into a down jacket. The parka can be made to suit any body type by simply stuffing certain pockets with extra materials to provide a tighter fit. The Final Home Bear, a snuggly companion, can also be stashed into one of the pockets as insulation.
