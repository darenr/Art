Bhabha is best known for her composite sculptures made from an array of organic and industrial materials. In Bleekmen Bhabha has altered and arranged found objects in a way that suggests a mask. The artist has also described the work as evoking a kind of derelict building. The sculpture has a ritualistic, perhaps totemic gravitas, but with its rough-hewn, decomposing quality, it seems to resist grandeur. Bleekmen variously conjures African, Egyptian, and Native American art, as well as futuristic aliens. In fact, the title of the work comes from the characters in Martian Timeslip, a 1964 science fiction book by Philip K. Dick, and refers to the indigenous people of Mars.
