In his Café Deutschland series Immendorff used a fictitious bar interior as a platform for examining the Third Reich, the division of Germany into East and West, and artistic identity. His paintings are densely packed with political iconography and feature a vast cast of political and artistic figures. In Café Deutschland he reveals his desire to bring politics into the home by depicting a carpet with the motif of the divided Germany. In Café Deutschland III—Partial Construction he refers to the rebuilding of East and West Germany after World War II.
