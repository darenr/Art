Lichtenstein took the image for Girl with Ball straight from an advertisement for a hotel in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. In pirating it, however, he transformed the photographic image, using a painter's version of the techniques of the comic-strip artist. The resulting simplifications intensify the artifice of the picture, concentrating its careful evocation of fun in the sun. The girlâ€™s round mouth is more doll-like than female; any sex appeal she had has become as plastic as her beach ball.
