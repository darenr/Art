To create this wall hanging, stainless steel filaments are placed arbitrarily on the ground and then intertwined using a shuttle or needle. Kumaiâ€™s work, concerned with the natural world, unites the organic and inorganic. Here the designer has chosen an industrial material conventionally used for its strength to create fragile, delicate spatial installations that seem to float weightlessly. The light plays on the undulating metallic strands, creating the feeling of invisible currents of air, billowing and folding.
