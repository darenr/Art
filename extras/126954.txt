Tenori-on (Japanese for "sound in your palm") is a handheld step sequencer that creates and displays synthesized music and light patterns, fusing the sequential and layering logic of electronic music with dynamic visual display. When pressed, each LED pixel emits a preprogrammed sound. Two speakers are located at the top of the screen, and buttons that determine the type of sound and beats per minute are arranged along the sides. Users program a specific sequence of sounds, which are activated with corresponding bursts of light. These patterns can be stored in the device and used during performance.
