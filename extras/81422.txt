Having worked as an impoverished poet for many years, Broodthaers began to make visual art in 1964, announcing rather provocatively, "I, too, wondered if I couldn't sell something and succeed in life. . . . The idea of inventing something insincere finally crossed my mind and I set to work at once." Broodthaers often used found or discarded materials, favoring eggshells, which are "without content other than the air." Using antique-looking furniture and organic materials, Broodthaers critiqued museum display and avoided modern products. In 1968, he created his own museum—called Museum of Modern Art—in his apartment, complete with labels and a catalogue.
