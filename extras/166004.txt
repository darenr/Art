Pardo’s work bridges the worlds of art, design, and architecture, seeking new ways to engage with viewers on both functional and aesthetic levels. These screenprints, executed in a range of lush colors reminiscent of 1960s or 1970s home decoration, feature a series of shapes that appear abstract but are in fact examples of the artist’s biomorphic lamp designs. The motifs represent only three lamps, but, with the help of a computer modeling program, Pardo has presented each from a variety of perspectives, turning these utilitarian objects into elusive, aestheticized forms. Unlike standard print editions, each portfolio in this edition of fourteen is unique; the artist used the same background colors for each group of fifteen screenprints but paired them with different motifs producing 210 distinct compositions.
