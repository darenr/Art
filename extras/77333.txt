Landmark was made during the summer of 1968 using images transferred from current issues of LIFE magazine. Inverted placement, layering, and significant variation in tone initially mask the fact that many of the images of people, animals, and objects are duplicated. Although Rauschenberg took to lithography reluctantly in the early 1960s, printmaking became for him "an artistic recording of an action as realistic and poetic as a brushstroke."
