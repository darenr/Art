Gardens Media Project, a loose collective of students from the University of Cape Town, produced posters and ephemera for various political organizations, including affiliates of the United Democratic Front (UDF), a federation of democratic organizations and trade unions. In 1989 members created a series of screenprinted posters on the theme of workers rights. Printed at Community Arts Project, where much of the groups work was carried out, the prints have the look of black-and-white linocuts but in fact were made using scratchboard, a photocopier, and stencils.
