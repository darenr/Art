With this table, Dutch design group Demakersvan has merged traditional and advanced manufacturing techniques. Using computer software, the designers translated sketches of the profiles of two antique tables into digital drawings and then made a rendering representing the two morphing into each other. Next, using computer-driven woodcutting machines normally employed for mass production, they fabricated the drawing as a three-dimensional object, in thin vertical sections out of sheets of birch. Each slice was glued by hand to the next, forming a unique piece of furniture.
