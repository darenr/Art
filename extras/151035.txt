R.S.V.P. I was included in Nengudi's breakthrough exhibition at Just Above Midtown Gallery in 1977. It is made of dark-hued panty hose that have been pulled, knotted, and filled with sand to create bulging, pendulous sacks and tautly outstretched limblike forms. "I am working with nylon mesh because it relates to the elasticity of the human body," Nengudi has explained. "From tender, tight beginnings to sagging. . . . The body can only stand so much push and pull until it gives way, never to resume its original shape."
