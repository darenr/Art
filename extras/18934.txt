Kokoschka's notorious play Murderer, Hope of Women was first produced in 1909 in Vienna, where its single performance caused a scandal. Set in barbaric antiquity against a backdrop of two chanting male and female choruses, it dramatizes the eternal clash between the sexes in violent, bloody terms. This book, published seven years later, brings together his text and four related drawings. The illustrations emphasize the brutal interactions between the two main characters. Their naked bodies are covered with tattoos, which at the time signified primitivism, criminality, and degeneracy.
