This portfolio, published four years after Schiele's untimely death from influenza in 1918, contains eight of the seventeen prints the artist made during his brief career, including examples of his signature sinuous nudes. The discomfort of their contorted poses seems especially acute in the drypoints, which feature sharply scratched lines and prickled edges. Schiele had been encouraged to try printmaking by his patron, art critic Arthur Roessler, who believed it would provide the artist access to the large German print market. Roessler and Franz Hauer, another supporter, appear in two of the portraits in this portfolio.
