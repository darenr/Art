The Reverend Howard Finster had been preaching since he was sixteen, and had worked in a variety of trades, before turning to art at the age of sixty. His work explores a personal cosmology, inspired by biblical verses, by his conceptions of heaven and hell, and by religious visions he began to experience as a small child.
