Tormented Self-Portrait (Susie at Arles) is an unconventional self-portrait. At the center of the work are brand names that represent day-to-day consumer choices. At the margins the artist repeats "Susie," his signature and trademark for this series, in the graphic style of a corporate logo. The work was inspired by self-portraits painted by Vincent van Gogh, but rather than relying on expressionistic brushstrokes, Bickerton proposes an abstract visage composed of consumer logos as a new form of self-expression and identity for a consumer society.
