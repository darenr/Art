Closely associated with the composer John Cage since the late 1930s, Cunningham established his own dance company in 1953 to explore ways to apply to choreography the same kinds of processes of chance that Cage was applying to music. By using chance operations Cunningham intended to encourage a play of possibilities beyond the range of his own choreographic imagination and memory. As part of his work he made charts like this one for every element of the performance, including movements, durations, and directions in space. Suite by Chance, one of the bestâ€“known of his early works, was first performed at a private studio performance in New York City in 1952.
