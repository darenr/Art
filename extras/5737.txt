As part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program, the Rural Electric Administration (REA) was created in 1935 to bring electricity to impoverished areas where as few as 10 percent of homes had electric power. The REA was able to build on Thomas Edison's success in marketing radios and phonographs to rural communities in the early twentieth century. The poster's core message was simple: radio would relieve the isolation of a lonely homestead. The patriotic color scheme implied that this was in the national interest, creating a more cohesive society through the spread of electrically powered amenities to all regions and social groups.
