Hats are a distinguishing characteristic of Lautrec’s portraits, often drawn with more attention to detail than his subjects’ faces, and several milliners appear repeatedly in his work. In this print, Renée Vert is shown arranging her wares, with a large hatbox at her feet labeled with Lautrec’s remarque (a personalized design commonly added to prints as a form of signature, in this case Lautrec’s monogram).
