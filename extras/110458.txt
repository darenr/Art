“Attracted to Light narrates the erratic behavior of a moth upon the stimulus of light,” Mann has explained. The insect’s path through the air is captured using cinematic technology and materialized through rapid prototyping (also called 3D printing). The design is part of Mann’s Long Exposure series, which also features lamps based on the trajectories of a bird in flight, taking off, and landing.
