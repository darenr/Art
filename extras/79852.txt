Wild, scribbled, graffitiâ€“like marks energize the expansive white surface of The Italians, revealing the artist's sensuous joy in manipulating his medium. The explosion of signs, ironically, is not without order or clarity: the rubbing of charcoal on the far left side of the canvas reveals the stretcher bar beneath it, a red heart can be seen at the bottom, and "roma" is written just beneath the artist's signature at the top right.
