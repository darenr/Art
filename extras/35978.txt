The support used for this work is supposedly wallpaper torn from Max Ernst's own walls. Wheels, screws, rods, and inscriptions are drawn in to create the appearance of a technical diagram of an enigmatic machine. The central wheel is inscribed "Le Curé" (The priest), and warnings such as "Ne touchez pas cette tête" (Do not touch this head) and "Méfiez vous des loueurs de chambres" (Beware of those who rent rooms), along with directives, "Marchez marchez" (Go) and the declaration, "enfant je t’ai...donné ce que j'avais" (Child I gave you...what I had), suggest themes of danger and vulnerability.
