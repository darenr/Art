Kocher designed this chaise in conjunction with a project for the Clarence White School of Photography in New York. Charged with remodeling a townhouse at 34 West 74th Street for the school's relocation, he designed and fabricated furniture for the faculty terrace before funding problems prevented the projects completion. Kocher, an architect, was especially interested in affordability, and through the 1930s he explored the use of new industrial materials in domestic structures, including aluminum with steel and canvas over plywood. He was the Editor of Architectural Record and a professor at Black Mountain College in North Carolina, for which he designed several buildings. He was recognized as an American leader in European-inspired modernism, and his work was featured in MoMAs 1932 "International Style" exhibition.
