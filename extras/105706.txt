This print is made on sheet metal. For each impression, Roth and Hartmut Kaminski, a Düsseldorf-based printer and the artist’s frequent collaborator, screenprinted both sides of an iron sheet. Next, Kaminski watered the plates with a garden hose to accelerate the rusting process. The work depicts a sardine can with its lid partially rolled back to reveal its contents, which appear to be carrots. The title reflects Roth’s love of wordplay and puns: in German, Wurzelbehandlung most commonly means “root canal,” and carrots are root vegetables.
