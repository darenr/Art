Monocoque is a construction technique whereby weight is carried by an objectâ€™s skin instead of an internal structure. In this project, loadbearing areas are thicker, and veinlike elements have been built into the skin where needed to carry weight. The composite prototype models, fabricated by a Polyjet three-dimensional printer, represent three strategies for the design and fabrication of singleshell structures.
