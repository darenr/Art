For as little as three dollars, this dress allowed teenage fans to parade their allegiance to a pop icon and was easily disposable after the novelty wore off. “Toughness is woven into the non–woven fabric for long, l–o–n–g wear,” read the packaging, “and should you tire (which is doubtful), just cut open all the seams and hang it on your wall as a poster, or cover pillows.” Although they were treated for fire– and water–resistance and were surprisingly sturdy, paper dresses required wearers to be constantly on guard against lit cigarettes and spilled drinks. By 1969 the short–lived paper–dress craze was all but over.
