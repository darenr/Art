IN-EI, meaning “shadow,” “shade,” or “nuance” in Japanese, is a collection of nine collapsible lampshades for LED bulbs made from a specially produced, recycled-PET fabric. Each lamp is folded from a single sheet of material thanks to a mathematical program created by Jun Mitani (a professor of computer science at the University of Tsukuba and a master origami artist). The fibers are strong enough to support the lamp’s entire structure, making an inner frame unnecessary.
