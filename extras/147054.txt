Here, the front facade of a house in an apparently typical American suburb has been replaced by glass, and a piece of mirror divides this otherwise very ordinary house into public and private sections. In this situation, the inhabitants of the dwelling would be visible through the enlarged picture window, but they themselves could gaze at the environment and activity outside. Alteration to a Suburban House is a seminal work of both art and architecture, raising questions about transparency and the boundaries between public and private and inside and outside using the format of the architectural model. Together with the reflections on repetition and banality typical of his early work, Graham introduced a critique of the modernist trope that the literal transparency of glass in architecture would lead to social transparency.
