Wallpiercing is a modular lighting system that appears to be inserted directly into walls or ceilings, piercing them like an earring. The system is composed of individual ring-shaped tubes mounted onto plaster panels, which can then be seamlessly integrated into the wall. The units can be isolated, arranged in groups, or linked to create luminescent patterns. The LED lamps radiate light inward, casting their glow onto the surface, and can be dimmed and controlled for color and brightness.
