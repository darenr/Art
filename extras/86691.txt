Film was embraced by the Soviet state in Russia as a potent propaganda tool for communicating with a widely illiterate population. In this poster designed by the Stenberg brothers, bold geometric letterforms, brilliant color, and photographic imagery combine to produce an arresting effect. In emphatic type along the left edge and repeated in each lens of the man's glasses, the poster announces the word Odinnadstaty (The eleventh), the title of the film, which documents eleven years of progress since the October Revolution of 1917. Agricultural and industrial machinery documented in the film are also reflected in the glasses, creating an analogy between the human eye and the camera lens. Despite the Stenbergs' fascination with film and photographic techniques, they hand-drew this and other designs on a lithographic printing surface.
