Like many of Martin Puryear's sculptures, Horsefly, the first of the artist's works to use glass , embraces contradictory elements. In this sculpture, the skeleton of which is formed by steel rods tied carefully together with wrapped wire, the interest resides in the unlikely combination of tar, wire, steel, and glass. Of these contradictions, Puryear has said, "I'm interested in mediating between a feeling of massiveness and fragility to reach a point of extreme vulnerability."
