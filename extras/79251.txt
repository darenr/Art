Echo: Number 15, 1951 is a radical departure from Pollock’s earlier "drip" paintings. In contrast to the explosive energy and multidirectional force of One: Number 31, 1950, made the previous year, Echo: Number 15, 1951 has a lyrical economy, and, though abstract, the painting flirts with figuration. Pollock recognized this, and he wrote in a letter to a friend, “I’ve had a period of drawing on canvas in black—with some of my early images coming thru—think the non-objectivists will find them disturbing—and the kids who think it simple to splash a Pollock out.”
