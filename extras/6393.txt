Poland was devastated during World War II and its infrastructure ruined. In the process of reconstruction, a new social and political order was to be forged through the centralized production of industry. The red-hot 6 in this poster proclaims the ideological superiority of the six-year plan designed to bring Polandâ€™s agricultural economy into closer alignment with that of the USSR. The style and socialist content of political posters was more tightly regulated by state agencies than those for cultural events.
