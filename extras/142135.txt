Founded in 1911, Die Aktion was a weekly journal for politics, literature, and art that featured original prints by Expressionist artists on its covers and interior pages. Along with the periodical Der Sturm it was a leading organ of the Expressionist movement in Berlin. Its founder and editor, Franz Pfemfert, was a Socialist and a pacifist, and the prints often appeared in the context of social criticism.
