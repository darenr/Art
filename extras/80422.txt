This painting is one of a series referencing Ocean Park, the beach landscape near Diebenkorn's California studio. Diebenkorn spent two decades developing this series, in which he gradually moved away from his earlier, more directly representational work. In Ocean Park 115 he evolved a type of abstraction characterized by a geometric division of space, sensuously worked surfaces, and luminous color. Diebenkorn explored new creative avenues in his work while maintaining a clear sense of balance and control. He stated, "My idea was simply to get all the elements right. By that I mean everything: color, form, space, line, composition, what all this might add up toâ€”everything at once."
