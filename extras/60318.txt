This edition comprises eighteen variants. Rothenberg found an oddly shaped block of wood outside the ULAE studio and carved the floating figure and the four circles into it. She reinked the block by hand for each impression, varying the colors every time. She also chose the textured Mexican handmade paper that further distinguishes each print in the edition.
