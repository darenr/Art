At Geopark, a public play area in the city of Stavanger, Norway's oil capital, redundant material from the petroleum industry is transformed into objects of play. The park's form is based on the topography of a vast underwater natural gas and oil field, called Troll, with bright orange buoys, salvaged pipelines, and recycled drilling platforms forming bike ramps and interactive play spaces, delineated on one side by a wall for graffiti. To inform their design, the architects conducted workshops with community groups, in accordance with the idea that sustainable practices depend not only on materials and building methods but also on a supportive network of industry representatives and regular citizens, children included.
