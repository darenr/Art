Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio's Slow House project explores the vacation home as a place that offers escape from a fast-paced urban environment and the ability to reconnect with the city at any time. This drawing shows a series of transverse sections extending from a plan of the building's lower level, tracing the path from the car's rearview mirror (symbolizing travel away from the city) to the houseâ€™s cherished water view. The section images show how the house arcs from the entry facade, which is just wider than the front door, to the double-height picture window framing the view. The split passage between the first and second levels, the building's horizontal curve, and the torqued outer wall of the house thwart direct visual access to this view at the structure's southwest end, slowing the visitor's approach to it. The architects have explained that the house "is conceived as a passage, a door that leads to a window . . . a physical entry to an optical departure."Challenging the conventions of architectural representation, Diller and Scofidio executed this drawing on a translucent sheet mounted on a wooden board and left drawing equipment attached to the final product.
