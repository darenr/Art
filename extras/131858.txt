Each example of Pocket Room consists of a slice of banana pressed onto a card that is rubber-stamped with the image of a table, housed in a plastic playingcard box small enough to fit into the owner’s pocket. The banana slices have gradually grown mold and decomposed; decay has progressed differently in each example, and so each object in the edition is unique. The work was commissioned by VICE-Versand, a German publisher that produced unlimited editions and sold them at modest prices. Issued continuously from 1968 until the late 1980s, this is Roth’s most widely circulated multiple.
