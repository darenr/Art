The foursquare geometry of Cage II and the purity of its medium exemplify the Minimal art of the 1960s, an art of system and order. Although the title is descriptive of the work's form, it is also a pun. The work is a reiteration of the artist's earlier sculpture Statue of John Cage, named after the well-known composer, whose theories on modern music and compositional structure influenced de Maria and other artists of his generation.
