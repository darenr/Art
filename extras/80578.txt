Gallagher's laborâ€“intensive paintings embed racial subtexts in otherwise abstract images. They Could Still Serve takes its title from an etching in Francisco de Goya's series The Disasters of War (1810-20), a caustic meditation on the brutality and futility of human warfare. "Bruised into a kind of caricature," as Gallagher puts it, the disembodied eyeballs in her work are reminiscent of lynchings and other "caprices" of inhumanity. The image suggests a fine line between comic book imagery and outright stereotype.
