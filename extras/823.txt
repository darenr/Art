Between 1967 and 1974, LÃ©on Krier both pursued urban projects and produced numerous drawings of architectural follies. The latter were triggered by vernacular architecture or structural engineering and generally situated in remote locations such as mountain sites, deserts, and Mediterranean islands. These visionary projects, inspired by both real circumstance and dream states, were conceived for specific individuals, such as friends or people whom Krier admired from a distance. In these small, highly personal projects he sought an escape from the formal and social principals of the modern masters, in particular, those of Le Corbusier, and a rediscovery of the essential methods of construction.
