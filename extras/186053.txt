The Stratocaster, Fender's flagship electric guitar,was designed "to become part of the player" with an ergonomic "comfort-contoured" body, a recessed jack to keep amplifier cables out of the way, volume and tone knobs positioned for easy adjustment while playing, and deep double cutouts for better neck access. Its original technical features included three pickups for a bright, glassy sound and a Fender-patented tremolo arm ("whammy bar"). The Stratocaster's user-friendly design and unique sound set an iconic new standard for electric guitar design and performance.
