Parreno belongs to a generation of artists who emerged during the early 1990s advocating an art practice that fosters active exchange with other artists and with the public, often in the form of participatory projects or events. The posters that make up Fade to Black depict images or texts—a photograph from an ephemeralevent, a typewritten document—related to the artist's work from the previous decade, made in collaboration with contemporaries such as Rirkrit Tiravanija and Liam Gillick. As the gallery lights intermittently turn on and off, the posters—printed in phosphorescent ink—fade in and out of visibility. Glowing in the darkness and mostly invisible in the light, the imagery on the posters, as Parreno has said, forms a sort of intangible archive of his formative years—a "flickering memory" of his artistic practice.
