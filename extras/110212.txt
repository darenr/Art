The Splight table lamp was inspired by the interconnected nature of our world. The name is a fusion of “spline,” a mathematical function used for interpolation, and “light.” Splight’s light source is surrounded by glass “fibers,” a cage that establishes a link between two electrical poles. Just as energy flows through a muscle’s fibers, powering appendages in the greater system of the body, energy flows through the lamp, powering the bulb and, by extension, the greater environment. The lamps can stand alone or be grouped into organic formations; they may be autonomous objects or parts of a greater whole.
