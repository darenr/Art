The nocturnal apparition here is a streetwalker, a seeming death mask version of Dix's luridly colored and grotesquely distorted portrait of another prostitute, Leonie. The image may reflect the common fear of syphilis and other diseases associated with prostitution; it is also a scorched, spectral emblem of the ravaged state of German society. In the background at the left is a subtly camouflaged profile of the artist.
