Yayoi Kusama works in a broad range of mediums, from painting and photography to installation and performance art. The possibility of infinite repetition suggested by the intricate netlike pattern visible in this work is one of the artist's signature motifs. The piece was made while Kusama was working in New York City from 1958 to 1968, before returning to her native Japan. She photographed her paintings, then cut up the black–and–white prints and fit them into a grid.
