This oversized nail was designed for the construction of wood-frame buildings in areas that are prone to severe natural events such as hurricanes and tornadoes. It has one hundred percent more uplift capacity (uplift is force applied parallel to the nail shank) and up to fifty percent more shear capacity (force applied perpendicular to the nail shank) than common sheathing nails. Walls constructed with these nails can carry a load up to twenty percent bigger and absorb about fifty percent more force before giving in.
