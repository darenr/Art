The Dream Drawing series is a body of over two hundred works in which the artist depicts visually overwhelming unconscious narratives drawn from his nightly dreams. According to Shaw, he began the Dream Drawings as a way to organize inspirational material from his dreams for potential future artworks; the Dream Objects are the final manifestation of his creative unconscious. Shaw masterfully applies existing artistic styles and inserts cultural symbols into his work, transforming them to suit his personal experiences and preferences.
