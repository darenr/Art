While it cannot take the place of self-defense classes, this accessory can provide a measure of safety to a woman walking alone at night. The ring is an alternative to the practice of a woman placing her keys between her fingers to use as a weapon in case of attack. The ring is more stable, slipping over three fingers; it requires less coordination to be effective; and it frees up the user's keys for easier and quicker access to her car or home. When not used for defense, the ring folds in on itself, taking the form of an elegant stack of three shapes, and it can be worn on one finger as a decorative accessory.
