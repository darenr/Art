Although primarily a painter, Oskar Schlemmer was appointed head of the theater group at the Bauhaus in 1925, inaugurating a period of theatrical experimentation. The Triadic Ballet, created before World War I but only presented as a completed work after 1922, was conceived for three dancersâ€”one female and two males. Schlemmer designed eighteen costumes for the ballets twelve choreographies, which were performed against backdrops of yellow, white, and black. Building on multiples of three, the artist explained, transcended the egotism of the individual and dualism of the couple, emphasizing the collective.
