The NOAQ Tubewall is an efficient and manageable system that protects land from flooding. The labor involved in forming dykes from sandbags can dissuade people from beginning the process until high-alert flood warnings have been issued, reducing the amount of time available to assure effective protection. Using air-filled tubes of reinforced plastic that connect to form a chain, the system requires little manpower and time for installation. A skirt attached along the tube on the flood side of the barrier utilizes the weight of the water above it to anchor the tube securely. The system has been used effectively on lawns, meadows, gravel, and asphalt.
