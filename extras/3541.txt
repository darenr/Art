This hinged, mobile kitchen on castors incorporates a stove, small refrigerator, pull-out cutting board, and a surprising abundance of storage space. It was shown in MoMA's landmark 1972 exhibition Italy: The New Domestic Landscape, which celebrated innovative, flexible designs responsive to new ideas about casual and adaptable living. In considering this dynamic, compact unit, Time magazine noted  its cultural significance: "In a country like Italy, where the kitchen is still a kind of sacred cave presided over by a mother-goddess, the design of a cooking module that can be rolled about and plugged in anywhere has profound implications. Not, perhaps, the immediate death of the nuclear familyâ€”but certainly a substantive critique of it."
