Redon was of the same generation as Impressionist artists Claude Monet and Paul Cézanne, but he believed that their devotion to everyday subjects severely limited the possibilities for their work. His was an art of the imagination and the fantastic. Religious and mystical scenes, like Apparition, are frequent in Redon's work; he rendered them in a personal style—highly colored and textured—without adherence to academic traditions.
