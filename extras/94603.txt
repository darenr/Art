When water is evaporated and condensed, chemicals, sand, and most harmful organisms are left behind, making the water safe to drink. A one-step distillation process, the Watercone is composed of a clear plastic cone and a black plastic pan. Salty or brackish water is poured into the pan; the black plastic absorbs the heat from the sun, evaporating the water, which condenses on the walls of the cone then drips into the lip at the base of the cone, where it is collected. When full, the cone can be turned upside down and the drinkable water funneled into containers. Based on evaporation levels tested in Casablanca, Morocco, each cone can produce up to about 1.5 liters (3 pints) of clean water a day.
