The Landlok Erosion Mat, with its sturdy, three-dimensional matrix of black polyolefin, helps plants resist the stresses typical of steep topography. It provides long-term stability and more than twice the erosion protection than plant life does on its own by interlocking with developing roots and anchoring itself to the soil surface.
