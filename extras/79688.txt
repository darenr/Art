When Louis began making his large Unfurled paintings in 1960, their dimensions often made it impossible for him to extend the canvasses fully in his small studio—the dining room of his Washington, D.C., home. Similarly, few galleries were large enough to accommodate them, and only two of the more than one hundred in this series were exhibited before the artist died in 1962. Although Louis painted on a vast scale, the brightly colored ribbons of paint cascading down the sides of this canvas invite a close look. Perhaps even more remarkable than the immense size of this work is the broad expanse of raw canvas Louis left exposed—an emphatic void framed by exuberant color.
