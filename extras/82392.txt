In 1964 Forberg was commissioned by MoMA, along with the Citizens' Committee for Children and the Park Association of New York City, to design a playground at the Cypress Hills Houses in East New York, Brooklyn, a high-rise development housing more than 1,400 families. Forberg's circular environment, seventy-two feet in diameter, was dominated by a forest of seven-foot-tall vertical concrete slabs that encouraged running and hiding while providing shade and shelter. The playground was admired by critics when it opened in 1967, but there were serious safety concerns, primarily regarding parental sight lines, and the site was eventually renovated with standard equipment.
