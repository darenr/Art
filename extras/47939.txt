This image is part of a series of close-up photographs of abstracted body parts set on the East Sussex coast that were acquired by MoMA after the Museum’s 1961 exhibition of Brandt’s work, which coincided with the publication of Perspective of Nudes. The book marked the culmination of more than a decade of work, distilled into just ninety plates.
