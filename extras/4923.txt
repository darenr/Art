The graphic design firm Chermayeff & Geismar has designed a wide range of public images: trademarks, advertisements, signs, sculptures, and even world's fair exhibitions. Its work revolves around the viewer, whose understanding and acceptance of an image's visual vocabulary are what make it a success. In these posters for Pan Am World Airways, cultural fantasies and ideals are projected through monumental imagery, presenting people and environments as distant objects of beauty. Rather than engaging with each country's everyday realities, the viewers of these images, potential travelers, remain aesthetic observers.
