In the 1980s Bourgeois began to construct enigmatic sculptural environments she calls "cells" that provide settings for her personal narratives. Here she explores the concept of the lair, a dwelling from the animal world. Bourgeois has said that a lair is "a protected place you can enter to take refuge," but she has also acknowledged the possibility of isolation: "The security of a lair can also be a trap."
