Breath comprises four animations on screens placed on the walls of a room. Each screen is a visualization of the imprint of the breath of vocalists expanding and contracting as they hum songs from four religions: Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, and Sufism. The delicate organic forms that register the vocalistsâ€™ breath and the audible succession of chants envelop viewers, immersing them in diverse cultures. On the recurring motif of breath in her work, Houshiary states: "I set out to capture my breath, to find the essence of my own experience, transcending name, nationality, cultures."
