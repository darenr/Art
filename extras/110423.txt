Of the more than two million incarcerated people in the United States, a disproportionate number come from very few neighborhoods in the country's biggest cities. In many places the concentration is so dense that states are spending in excess of a million dollars a year to lock up the offending residents of single city blocks. Using difficult to obtain data from the criminal justice system, Spatial Information Design Lab, in partnership with the New York-based Justice Mapping Center, has created maps of these "million dollar blocks" and of the migratory flow between city and prison in five of the nationâ€™s cities. "The maps pose difficult ethical and political questions for policy makers and designers," Kurgan has explained. "When they are linked to other urban, social, and economic indicators of incarceration, they also suggest new strategies for approaching urban design and criminal justice reform together."
