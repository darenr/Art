Saarinen, an architect, designed this chair shortly after joining Knoll Associates in 1943. Its name expresses its purpose: "It was designed on the theory that a great number of people have never really felt comfortable and secure since they left the womb. The chair is an attempt to rectify this maladjustment in our civilization." Saarinen further explained, "There seemed to be a need for a large and really comfortable chair to take the place of the old overstuffed chair. . . . Today, more than ever before, we need to relax."
