To make these drawings Chan appropriated erotic texts by personages as diverse as the Marquis de Sade's Bishop X, Monica Lewinsky, and Saint Augustine, assigning excerpts to letters of the alphabet. The resulting digital "fonts" can be downloaded from the artist's Web site, allowing users to generate limitless expressions of desire simply by typing. Sitting atop shoes, these human-scaled drawings lend bodies to the typefaces, bridging the gap between the virtual and the corporeal. The body of Oh Untitled (truetype font), with its horizontal ink strokes, is a sort of blank template for the project, while The body of Oh Marys is inspired by Mary Magdalene's relationships with male figures in the Bible. These belong to a cycle of twenty-one font drawings related to Chan's media installation Sade for Sade's sake (2009).
