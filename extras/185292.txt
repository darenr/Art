Since 1902 Roller had collaborated with Mahler on the creation of posters, lighting and set design that would spring "with inner necessity" from the music, creating powerful, cumulative effects on the viewer. The giant initials on this poster indicate Mahler’s dual significance as composer and conductor on the occasion of the symphony’s world premiere. "Imagine that the universe begins to ring and resound ... With evolving planets and suns," wrote Mahler of this musically groundbreaking fusion of song and symphony. The expressive letterforms, dramatic color contrasts and swelling rhythms of Roller's design capture the spirit and ambitious scale of the production.
