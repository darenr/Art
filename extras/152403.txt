This abstract puzzle, created in 1985 by Pajitonov, a Russian computer programmer employed by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, is highly addictive and becomes, when played for extended periods of time, an almost meditative practice. Tetris has become one of the most universal of all video games, appealing to players across lines of age, gender, and geography and adapted for nearly every gaming and computer system. Many people bought Nintendo's Game Boy specifically to play Tetris, which was included with purchase of the device when it was released in 1989.
