Bridge may have the appearance of a primitive rope bridge, but it is constructed of steel wool, a modern industrial product. This is the most ambitious of the works in Pascali's last series, Reconstructions of Nature: besides Bridge, it includes a human trap, jungle vines, and an animal skin all crafted of unlikely materials such as rubber and fake fur. An Italian critic coined the term "Arte Povera" in 1967 to describe the work of Pascali and other Italian artists who worked with "poor," nonart materials. These artists renounced the separation between art and life and aimed to expand or dissolve the traditional parameters of painting and sculpture. "I do not believe you make shows in galleries," Pascali said, "you make the gallery, you create the space."
