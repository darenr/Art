Schendel, one of the major figures of postwar Brazilian art, was a painter, printmaker, and draftsman. A trained philosopher and poet, she used her art to address existential questions and to subvert the traditional hierarchies between artistic mediums. Particularly significant was her interest in the materiality of writing as a visual feature.Around the mid-1960s, Schendel produced a series of three-dimensional works that she thought of as ephemeral sculptures. She called them Droguinha, or "little drug," a slang expression that signifies "nothing" or "something worthless." Like this one, they are composed of knotted rice paper that Schendel intertwined by hand. The formless network of twisted cords evokes the act of weaving and can be placed horizontally or vertically. Neutralizing the tension between figure and support, material and meaning, Droguinha represents a radical artistic example of void or absence materialized as a metaphysical fullness.
