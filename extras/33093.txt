Deaf from birth, Castle never learned to speak, sign, read, or write. His art, intimate in scale and focus, was the means by which he conveyed his inner vision and inventiveness, and he created a visual language inspired by his Idaho home and daily life. Refusing formal art training, Castle devised his own methods. He drew in a mixture of soot and saliva with a sharpened stick on found surfaces and created thousands of drawings, constructions, and books throughout his adult life.
