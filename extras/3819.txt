Composed of hundreds of bound and stacked "ponytail" units, this work assumes a different form each time it is exhibited. The repetitive, tactile process by which it has been constructed and installed reflects Hicksâ€™s preoccupation with gesture in textile fabrication. When intermeshed, individual threads form a textile, but here they are massed, emphasizing their collective volume. The heaped linen threads invite the viewer to reconceive the structural potential of the soft material.
