The poster movement of the 1890s was a new phenomenon that emphasized connections between the graphic and fine arts. In this respect lithography was particularly important, allowing artists to draw directly onto a specially prepared stone and to integrate their own style of lettering into allover designs. The decorative stylization and Symbolist content of Toorop's posters influenced a wide circle of fin-de-si√®cle artists through The Studio, the first of a new generation of magazines that disseminated the New Art to an international audience. The angel at the center of this composition was typical of imagery that challenged conventional ideas about feminine beauty. In many centers the New Art was connected to movements for social and spiritual reform, and this poster advertises a rehabilitation center for the destitute.
