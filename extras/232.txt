Van Doesburg understood modern architecture and modern painting as complementary, arguing that the two media had something basic in common: the flat plane. He believed that painting could serve as a laboratory for testing architectural ideas. This work in gouache was not intended as a plan for a specific building but as abstract explorations of spatial relationships. Van Doesburg began with plans for private houses that he had developed with the architect Cornelis van Eesteren. Then he eliminated the signs of functional architecture: doors, windows, and roof are all absent, and no directional cues distinguish front from back. Instead, the structure floats freely in space and time.
