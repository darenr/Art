Written in 1925, Mikhail Bulgakov's story satirizes the concept of the "New Soviet man," an ideal figure of the state defined, among other traits, by enthusiasm for Soviet collectivism. It features a stray dog, which Professor Preobrajensky—a "rejuvenation" specialist—implants with a human pituitary gland and testicles. The dog becomes more and more human, developing a taste for vodka, politics, and women, and turns the professor’s life upside down until he reverses the procedure.
