Sean Scully's paintings depict geometric forms that are painterly rather than precise. Scully is aware that these abstract works come decades after the style was absorbed into the mainstream: "I'm not fighting for abstraction. Those battles have already been fought. I'm using those victories to make an abstraction that is, in fact, more relaxed, more open, and more confident."
