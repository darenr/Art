This innovative design was inspired by Adler’s grandmother, who took her husband’s medication by mistake and didn’t realize what she had done until she started feeling sick. The new bottles provide an ample flat surface on which prescription information can be hierarchically organized. Each household member is assigned a different colored ring placed on the neck of the bottle. User-friendly icons clearly communicate health warnings. Finally, a removable card inserted in a permanent sleeve on the ClearRx bottle contains important facts and warnings.
