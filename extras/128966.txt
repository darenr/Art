Working out of architect Mies van der Rohe’s Berlin office, Lilly Reich coordinated the redesign of the New York apartment of the architect and Museum of Modern Art curator Philip Johnson. Located on East Fifty–Second Street, this is one of the apartment’s bedrooms. Characteristic of Reich’s interiors is the play between polished and textured surfaces and the use of silk or velvet curtains to define architectural space and atmosphere. Reich began her career as a designer of textiles and women’s apparel, which was one of the few fields in design open to women at that time. This minimalist aesthetic reveals her unwavering and enduring commitment to modernist principles of function and simplicity.
