Clark, a painter, sculptor, and performance artist, studied in Paris then returned to her native Brazil in 1952. Influenced by the abstract compositions she saw in Europe, she rejected her early figurative style and began working with geometric abstraction. The Modulated Surfaces series she created between 1954 and 1958 is one of her earliest experiments with the formal and spatial effects of geometric forms on a flat picture plane.
