This work marries color and light, bringing them into three dimensions. In dialogue with the surrounding space, the vertical and horizontal tubes both illuminate and obscure the corner—a location not typically used for displaying art. Though the emitted light transcends its physical encasement and transforms the surrounding space, Flavin rejected any characterization of his work as sublime. “One might not think of light as a matter of fact, but I do,” he stated. “And it is . . . as plain and open and direct an art as you will ever find.” Flavin began to use commercially available fluorescent light tubes in 1963.
