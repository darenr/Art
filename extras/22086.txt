Stop Traveler (Siste Viator) was conceived for the Sonsbeek international sculpture exhibition, held in Arnhem, The Netherlands, the site of one of World War II's most important battles. Intended as a "literary memorial" to British, Dutch, Polish, and German war casualties, this project features reprints of books and book covers that could have been read by those killed in battle. For each language, one book was reproduced entirely, while the other copies contain blank pages only. The artist inserted ex libris bookplates naming individual casualties.
