The Tuttuno contains a pull-out bed, table, drawers, and shelves below an elevated conversation pit. Internotredici designed this compact unit to combine storage, sleeping, and eating areas with a place for socializing and relaxing. When not in use, the bed, table, and drawers slide into the unit and out of sight. Originally released in 1969, Tuttuno was redesigned and released in limited production in 1971.
