Their spiky tentacles reaching toward each other, the male and female forms in this bronze sculpture are locked in violent opposition. "It is nearly impossible to make people understand each other," Martins said, suggesting the source of the aggressive interaction depicted here. Between 1944 and 1949, she made several versions of this sculpture in different sizes and materials. When a plaster version was exhibited in 1946, a Time magazine reviewer said it "looked like a disagreement between two anthropomorphic snowstorms."
