Looking at the overall shape of this work, what might first come to mind is an intrinsic relationship to pure geometry. However, like many of the artist's works from this period, this study was inspired by empirical observation: one day in 1951, while crossing the Seine River in Paris, Kelly noticed the black shadow of a bridge's arch and its reflection on the water. In 1955, after his return to New York, Kelly executed a wooden relief repeating this shape but making it larger. In this version, which is also in the Museum's collection, he painted the relief white, distancing the motif from its original source and creating an autonomous pictorial statement.
