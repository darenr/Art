Lenica studied architecture and music before turning to poster design and film animation. From 1954 he worked alongside Tomaszewski at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts. Lenica considered this poster a personal favorite; in 1983 he said of it, "For the first time I began to develop a personal interpretation, with a particular Polish resonance. The original title of Felliniâ€™s film, Il bidone, was completely different. But it is a story about a con man, and in Polish a 'Blue Bird' is exactly that." The poster was awarded the 1961 Toulouse-Lautrec Grand Prix at the II International Film Poster Exhibition in Versailles.
