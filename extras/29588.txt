Picasso and poet Pierre Reverdy became friends in the early 1910s. Reverdy composed these poems during World War II, and they are written here in his hand; Picasso responded with illuminations. The book’s publisher, Tériade, was an admirer of illuminated manuscripts, and many of the books he published with artists feature handwritten texts.
