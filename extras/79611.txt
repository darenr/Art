This painting belongs to Rothko’s Black on Gray group of paintings. He divided the canvas into distinct halves, limited himself to two colors, and introduced a crisp, white border. The limited palette and stark composition differ significantly from the atmospheric Color Field paintings for which he is best known. Created during the last years of the 1960s, this painting betrays the influence of Minimal art on Rothko’s work.
