To design these tables, Kram and the Weisshaars created an algorithm that takes into consideration constraints such as size, weight, and tabletop height, then let a computer imagine hundreds of configurations. The designers selected some of the most elegant solutions, then the tablesâ€™ legs and cross braces were laser cut from from sheets of steel, complete with engraved instructions for assembly by bending machine.
