A legendary bartender, Lautrec presided over an infamous party thrown by Alexandre Natanson and his wife in 1895. The invitation promised “American and other drinks,” and when guests arrived they found Lautrec behind the bar concocting extraordinarily strong drinks as well as his inventive “solid cocktails,” which included such ingredients as sardines, juniper, and port.
