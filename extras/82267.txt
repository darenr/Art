Maiolino is concerned with line as a presence in real space. Using sewing thread to mend gaps and create visual connections between her other materials, she questions division and opposition between inside and outside, positive and negative, black and white, and front and back. For her, both sides of a print and drawing are equally important: “I was intrigued by the space at the reverse side of the paper: what is behind it, what is out of sight—the other space of the absent, the latent, the concealed. I began to print both the front and backsides of the paper. Then, through cutting and folding, I was able to discover what was printed on the reverse and to incorporate it in the work together with the void left by the removal of the paper cut from it. Now the print did not only reside in the plane of the sheet, but by adding other dimensions became a graphic object.”
