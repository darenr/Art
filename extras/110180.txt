In this series of diagnostic tools, trained bees perform health checkups, detect diseases, and monitor fertility cycles. "Bees have a phenomenal odor perception," Soares has explained. The Face Object has two chambers. If bees detect an odor in the breath connected to a disease, they will go into the smaller chamber. The Fertility Object has three chambers: the largest corresponds to ovulation, the second to pre-ovulation, and the third to post- ovulation. The Precise Object has an outer curved tube that prevents bees from flying accidentally into the interior diagnosis chamber, making for a more precise result.
