The colorful concentric circles and circuitous lines that compose this painting evolved from Tanaka's performance Electric Dress, premiered a decade before, in which she wore two hundred blinking incandescent lightbulbs and tubes covered with red, blue, yellow, and green enamel paint. The painting vividly records the artist's gestural application of layers and skeins of multicolored acrylic paint on the canvas as it lay on the floor. Such a performative practice was typical of members of Gutai, a group of Japanese artists (including Tanaka) active between 1954 and 1972. Gutai means "embodiment" or "concrete"; through their experimental works, these artists aimed to bring materials together with the human spirit.
