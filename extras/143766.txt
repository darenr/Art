For almost thirty years, the Los Angeles-based artist Andrea Fraser has been engaged in an ongoing investigation of what we want from art. Combining feminist perspectives on subjectivity and desire with the site-specific and research-based practices that emerged with Conceptual art and institutional critique in the late 1960s, Fraser uses performance, video, and a range of other mediums to explore and critique the motivations that drive artists, art collectors, art dealers, corporate sponsors, museum trustees, and museum visitors. The Public Life of Art: The Museum was filmed at The Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Museum of Modern Art. The video, produced by Terry McCoy, was created in collaboration with New York-based artist and photographer Louise Lawler. The first-ever performance Fraser realized for video, The Public Life of Art: The Museum features the artist discussing the social history of the art museum, from corporate sponsorship to economic social policy.
