[3] See exhibition announcement in Art Digest, vol. 12, no. 5 (December 1st, 1937), p. 20: "In the realm of modern art, nothing is quite so rare as a Modigliani stone head â€¦ So it is with special interest that devotees of the Modern French await the coming exhibition (Dec. 6 to 23) at the galleries of Mrs. Cornelius J. Sullivan, New York, which will contain two of these rarities." MoMA's sculpture is reproduced. Included in the exhibition Art in Our Time, New York: The Museum of Modern Art, May 10-September 30, 1939 (lent by "Mrs. Cornelius J. Sullivan"). On January 1, 1939, Mary Sullivan informed Barr: "I am happy that the Modigliani head will have a larger audience than my gallery gives it, and best of all that it will be shown by the Modern Museum."
