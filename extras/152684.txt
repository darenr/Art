Lautrec loved the theater and designed programs for the avant-garde productions of the Théâtre Antoine, where he held season tickets, and the Symbolist stagings of the Théâtre de l’Oeuvre. Assembled by the French bibliophile, print collector, and theatergoer Henri Beraldi, this remarkable album of theater programs, which includes fifty programs by Lautrec, Pierre Bonnard, Edouard Vuillard, and others, offers unique evidence of the cross-fertilization of art and theater in fin-de-siècle Paris.
