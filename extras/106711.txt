Grippo, one of the leading figures in Latin American Conceptualism, considered Life, Death, Resurrection to be one of the most important achievements of his career. In this work, he combined organic materials with found and sculpted objects to depict natural forms of energy, growth, and decay in a display that mimics a scientific experiment. Grippo made several versions of Life, Death, Resurrection; this is the only one that features all the elements of the work's first installation, in 1980. It includes a violin filled and broken by germinated corn; a series of lead forms, half of them broken by the germination of red beans; and a piece of found wood that has been attacked by worms. The work is an allegory of the collisions between life and art, materiality and energy, time and form, and intelligence and nature.
