In numerous texts and a series of eleven houses, Eisenman expounded his theory of an autonomous architecture in which form need not respond to specific requirements. Here, architecture takes on an intellectual role that is distanced from the constraints of reality—a seemingly apolitical attitude that is itself an entrenched statement on the cultural power of design. Thus, elements such as columns and walls are separated from an aesthetic and functional context and used as part of a notational system. The inscription at the lower left of this work —“Building may be the mere representation of an idea first stated in drawing”—indicates the primacy of drawing in Eisenman’s thought process. The sequence of axonometric drawings acts as a diagram for the transformation of a basic cube into a highly developed spatial configuration; shelter is the result of cerebral processes that speak of architecture’s ability to generate its own logic and authority.
