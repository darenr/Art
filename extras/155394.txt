In preparing the title sequence for Goldfinger, Brownjohn—together with his assistant, Trevor Bond, and friend Herbert Spencer—experimented at length with camera angles and projected lighting in a darkened studio with actress Margaret Nolan. Brownjohn explained his exploratory method in an interview a couple years later: “It was all done in the camera, which is the way I like to do films, you know. I hate storyboards and scripts. It’s nice just to have an idea and go on the floor and play around with the camera and the lights, and then shoot what you want.”
