Curator, Paola Antonelli: This collection of therapeutical objects is the work of Mathieu Lehanneur, a young designer based in Paris, France. He thinks that ever since little pharmacies, little apothecaries, in little villages and in various areas of the city disappeared -- with them, a whole piece of the relationship that people have with medicine has disappeared as well. We have lost the narrator, we have lost the person, the guidance that tells us how often, when and how to take the medicines. Lehanneur tried to recuperate this particular narration in the objects, in the packaging of the medicines themselves [...].These objects are still at a purely conceptual stage, of course. They involve the manufacturing of completely new packaging, and in some cases, they also involve the delivery of medicines in a completely different way. Nonetheless, they are a very strong reminder of the humanity of patients, a humanity that needs to be addressed by pharmaceutical companies, by making medicines more approachable, more understandable in their use, and easier to take.
