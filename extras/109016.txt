Blake's animations, which merge allusions to architecture and abstract art with psychedelic effects, have been called "timeâ€“based paintings."  The artist referred to this piece as a "hallucinatory treatment of an imaginary ski lodge." He went on to say, "I hope that viewing my work will leave one in a quietly contemplative but also somewhat disoriented state."
