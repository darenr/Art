In the event of a large-scale emergency, when many communications and power infrastructures are down, this human-powered, battery-free radio can keep its user aware of the current situation. The Freeplay Foundation, a humanitarian organization that works mostly in Africa, sells this radio to subsidize the production of a sturdier version, the Lifeline radio, which has been conceived to operate in the harshest conditions and climates. The Lifeline radio is distributed for free to distant communities that have no access to electricity and cannot afford batteries. One great obstacle to the alleviation of poverty is isolation; radio can play a vital role in its capacity to reach people isolated by geography, conflict, or illiteracy, giving them access to information and education.
