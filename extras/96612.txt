Marshall's Vignette series continues his exploration of the representation of the black figure in art. The artist works in traditional pictorial genres, explicitly referencing various artistic styles and techniques as a part of his critical investigation of the pretensions of art history. In this study for a painting, a couple is posed in a loving embrace in an idyllic landscape, encircled by large, cartoonish pink hearts, a reference to the frivolity and sentimentality that characterizes eighteenth-century French Rococo painting. Deploying nostalgia, Marshall meditates on beauty, love, romance, and harmony in the black experience.
