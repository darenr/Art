Beginning in the late 1960s, Morris, who had previously made geometric plywood and steel forms, began to use more malleable media, such as felt,inviting the material’s properties and chance operations—in this case, gravity—to play a role. He called this Process Art. Morris was active in experimental dance beginning in the 1950s and was interested in the corporeal aspects of felt; its "skinlike" qualities resonated with his own concerns at the time.
