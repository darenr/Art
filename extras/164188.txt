Since the 1970s, Maurer has explored the nature of space and movement though the use of serial sequences of images, signs, and language. Working in photography, film, and graphic design, she makes art based on mathematical and conceptual processes, often reversing, repeating, and repositioning objects for the camera. In Reversible and Changeable Phases of Movement, Study No. 4, she has distilled images of action into a series of images that can be read from right to left, as catching, and from left to right, as throwing, highlighting the subjective nature of interpretation. Maurer’s process–oriented oeuvre unites the concrete and the conceptual in a manner that suggests the centrality of perspective—in art, as in life.
