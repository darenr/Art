Chica (also called Junior) is a modular system of plastic components that can be fitted together in a variety of ways to create seats, tables, and play structures. The elements, made in four bright colors, are light enough for older children to play with and reconfigure, in a product that exemplifies the fun, flexible spirit of Italian postwar design. These prototypes, featured in MoMA's 1972 exhibition Italy: The New Domestic Landscape, demonstrated curator Emilio Ambasz's concept of "contestatory" design: objects with the potential to create environments that were “flexible in function and [permitting] multiple modes of use and arrangement.”
