Zang Tumb Tumb was Marinetti's first published collection of parole in libertà (words in liberty), a form of poetry at the same time verbal and visual. Begun in 1912 and published in 1914, the work is an account of Marinetti's experience of the Siege of Adrianople (now Edirne, Turkey) during the Balkan War of 1912, which he covered as a war correspondent. The title Zang Tumb Tumb evokes the sounds of mechanized war—artillery shelling, bombs, explosions.
