By the 1930s the Coors Porcelain Company was one of the world's largest producers of chemical porcelain, a material developed from chemical experimentation with silicate compounds. Heat- and scratch-resistant, the material was well suited for both industrial and domestic use. Many of the simple vessel shapes that became popular in American kitchens were in fact taken directly from German laboratory wares on which an embargo had been placed in 1915. Coors had strong links with Germany, where one of its directors had received his training as a chemist.
