"I try to show," Bearden said, "that when some things are taken out of the usual context and put in the new, they are given an entirely new character." A strategy of fragmentation and recombination informs Bearden's approach to art-making. The reclining figure at the center of the work resembles those of Egyptian tomb reliefs and its flattened pictorial space recalls Cubist painting. The background is made from collaged fabric that the artist has assembled into a patchwork quilt, invoking a distinctive African American domestic tradition.
