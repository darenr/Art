This textile was one of a series that Raymond designed for MoMA's Organic Design in Home Furnishings competition and exhibition in 1940–41. Like Eileen Gray's lacquer screen (on display on this platform), it represents a creative response to Japanese aesthetic and craft traditions. Raymond had lived in Tokyo for eleven years with her husband and collaborator, architect Antonin Raymond. "The doing away with all but essentials, or discipline, is the basis of Japanese charm," the Raymonds observed in 1935. "Everything serves a precise purpose and is only satisfactory relative to that purpose. The highest satisfaction which a Japanese experiences is to be found in the harmony which he perceives between the idea, the act and the material. . . . It is through increased simplicity and elimination that the man of taste finds elegance. . . . All is the direct result of a necessity, be it material or spiritual.”
