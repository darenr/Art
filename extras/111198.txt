Weiner's main material is language. In 1968 he declared that his works do not have to be constructed by him or even fabricated at all. From that time, his art has consisted of "propositions"—usually texts written on walls—rather than objects. The French publishing house onestar press invited Weiner to design a bookshelf to display the artist's books they have produced since 2000. The company's name is a play on "one–star hotel" and refers to the inexpensive digital rotary press the publisher uses.
