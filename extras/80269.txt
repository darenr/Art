This painting is one of several monochromes in which Reinhardt explored the use of a vertical format. The combination of the white paint with the natural color of the underlying canvas emphasizes the composition.s tonal variations. The rough-edged, horizontal brushstrokes of varying length and paint saturation create a bricklike pattern that is at once structured and painterly. Reinhardt developed these brick forms with greater linearity and modularity in paintings such as Abstract Painting (Blue) of 1953.
