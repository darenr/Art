This work was commissioned by the Museum in 1940 for the landmark exhibition Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art. It was painted by Orozco over a period of ten days, often in front of the viewing public.This six-panel fresco (intended to be arranged in any order) depicts abstracted elements of mechanical warfare, including the tail and wings of a bomber, tanktreads, and chains—as well as a pair of upturned human legs. Ironically, though, Orozco insisted it had "no political significance." He stated, "I simply paint the life that is going on at the present—what we are and what the world is at this moment. That is what modern art is."
