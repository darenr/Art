My Vows brings together hundreds of photographs that each present a small part of a human body: mouth, ear, foot, nose, genitals, hand, breast, and so on. Each hangs from a string, joining and partly obscuring others. Together they make a dense circle whose diameter is barely greater than the height or arm span of a tall person. The individual elements—male and female, old and young, seductive and repellent—form a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Physical, psychological, and sexual identities commingle in an inexhaustible variety of unpredictable relationships, which together threaten to overwhelm the stable patterns of our familiar arrangements.
