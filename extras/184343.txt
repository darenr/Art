The poster's title references both Bob Dylan's version of the folk-song "Blowin' in the Wind" and the electro-psychedelic explosion of "Mister Tambourine Man" that followed. The photograph of Dylan that forms the main image was enlarged from a small photo in a book. Sharp then applied a dense decorative overlay inspired by motifs in art by Leonardo da Vinci and Aubrey Beardsley. "I can remember my dear friend Eija Vehka Aho creating all the beautiful circles that make up Bob Dylan's hair and which contribute so much to the work," Sharp later recalled. Over 100,000 copies were sold for Â£1 through mail order and Big O outlets around the world between 1967 and 1970.
