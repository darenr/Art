Barney's small drawing, mounted on a hinged apparatus of prosthetic plastic, diagrams the three personalities identified in the title of the work: famed magician Harry Houdini, punk-rock star Wendy O. Williams of the band the Plasmatics, and football legend Jim Otto. The artist's identification with athletes and performers indicates his interest in physical strength, endurance, and exaggerated performance. Barney, who draws from his own experience as an athlete, is perhaps best known for his extravagant films featuring bizarre characters involved in ritualized activities. The notational and cryptic pencil map, attached to a movable armature, links seemingly diverse personas and their physical actions with the graphic mark.
