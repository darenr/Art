Telepresence, currently used for military and exploratory purposes, is the experience of being present at a real (nonvirtual) location, remote from ones own physical position. Auger and Loizeau's project explores the application of telepresence in a social context. Social Telepresence consists of a small camera and a binaural microphone attached to the remote, "rented" body or moving object. The user receives images from the camera through a wireless connection and views them with a set of TV glasses. His or her body becomes a host; its senses are replaced by those of the remote body, translated in real time. Use of this remote body could allow, for example, a shy person to visit a sex club or go on a blind date, businesspeople to attend meetings at a distance, and an immobile person to take a walk.
