The designers seek to stimulate debate about the social, cultural, and ethical impact of emerging technologies. Their collaborators and clients range from cultural institutions to industrial research laboratories; their design objects are a medium for exploration and reflection on daily life in the age of advanced technology. Priscila Huggable Atomic Mushroom is part of the collection Design for Fragile Personalities in Anxious Times, prescription products that explore the psychological connections between objects and their users. The designers invite us to embrace our fears, quite literally: to take home a symbol of nuclear annihilation and cuddle it.
