Screen icon and sex symbol Marilyn Monroe was a favorite subject of many Pop artists, and she figures prominently in more than fifteen works in the Museum’s collection. Here, in a tribute to the actress created soon after her suicide in 1962, Rosenquist inverted and fragmented her image and superimposed a portion of her name over it. He also included a segment of the brand name “Coca-Cola” in its trademark script, rendered upside down. Pairing Monroe with this famous logo suggests that she is as iconic an example of American popular culture as the ubiquitous soft drink.
