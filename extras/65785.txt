Warhol based these screenprints on press images he collected in the months following President John F. Kennedy's assassination. He chose iconic scenes of Jacqueline Kennedy just before and after she was widowed and cropped them closely around her face. While Jackie's changing expression amounts to a timeline of the tragedy, the metallic ink surfaces, perfectly flat and devoid of any surrounding activity, render the scenes more abstract, both formally and emotionally.
