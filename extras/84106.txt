Cable Turtle is an ingeniously simple case for shortening and containing cables to prevent tangles. The two thermoplastic rubber shells fold inside out and then back together, allowing the user to wrap a cable around the inner spool then neatly enclose it in the turtlelike casing. The designers decided that no poisonous glues or dangerous assembly methods could be used and therefore opted for a permanent snap-fit that requires no other materials or dangerous solvents.
