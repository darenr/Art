Standardization, objectivity, and impersonal form characterized both modernist architecture and graphic design. For the exhibition Wohnung und Werkraum  (Living and work space) in Breslau, Molzahn designed an integrated campaign in which different types of printed matter—posters, brochures, letterheads, labels, stamps, etc.—affirmed the overriding identity of the event. Of particular note was his synthesis of typography and photomontage. "Today we can express ourselves better and more quickly with the help of photography than by the laborious means of speech or writing," wrote Tschichold. "It is precisely the contrast between the apparent three dimensions of photography and the plane form of type that gives our typography its strength."
