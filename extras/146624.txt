Baas's Analog Digital Clock appears at first glance to be a large, flat wall version of a classic digital clock. In fact it is a videotaped performance of an actor painting or erasing sections of the digital display numbers, minute by minute, by hand, elegantly combining the analog and digital worlds. In Sweepers Clock, using the same technique, the hours and minutes are marked by two men sweeping garbage. Analog Digital Clock and Sweepers Clock are part of Baas's Real Time series, a set of four works in which peopleâ€™s actions, rather than traditional clocks, present the passage of time as a highly physical, even labor-intensive process.
