SIMILAR TO DESIGNING MODERN WOMEN TEXT:In the late 1920s and the 1930s, kitchens were highlighted in many modern architecture exhibitions. This poster for an exhibition in Basel is dominated by an axonometric rendering of a miniscule kitchen by Swiss architect Rudolf Preiswerk. In the exhibition, visitors could see a full-scale model of the same design, which had a footprint little more than thirty-seven square feet (3.4 square meters). In the accompanying catalogue, German design reformer Erna Meyer identified such compact and ergonomic arrangements as the most important trend in modern kitchen design.
