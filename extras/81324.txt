Untitled (Stack) is made of up to twelve rectangular metal boxes—a simple geometric form Judd favored because he felt it carried no symbolic meaning. Depending on the height of the ceiling where the work is displayed, the number of units may be reduced in order to maintain even spacing between them. Judd made this work based on a predetermined system, circumventing the spontaneous decisions artists often face during the art-making process. Like many of his Minimalist contemporaries, Judd used industrial materials—in this case, galvanized iron and green lacquer paint typically used in auto body shops—and had the work fabricated in a metal workshop according to his specifications.
