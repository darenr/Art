The Handkerchief chair, designed for the Knoll furniture company by Lella and Massimo Vignelli and available in a range of colors, offers a playful take on the traditional stacking office chair. The flowing shape of its synthetic seat is ergonomic and suggests weightlessness, like a handkerchief floating in the breeze. The fruitful, collaborative relationship between husband and wife began in 1961, and the couple founded Vignelli Associates in the United States in 1971. Their work together has encompassed designs for graphics (most notably corporate identity and wayâ€“finding systems) as well as interiors, furniture, and industrial products, all executed with an elegant simplicity.
