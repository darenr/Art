This haunting mask expresses its extreme function in its equally extreme form. Richard Armellino, the designer’s father, was a pioneer in the field of body–armor design and founded the company American Body Armor, which first used Kevlar in protective garments for police officers in the 1970s. The designer continued in his father’s footsteps and is now president and CEO of U.S. Armor Corporation.
