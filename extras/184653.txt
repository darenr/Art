James Richards's moving-image works are collaged from a wide range of source material, often eschewing fixed form in favor of remix and improvisation. His works carve out a space for poetics amid the relentless flow of electronic data and images that have defined the twenty-first century.This work is comprised of rhythmic assemblages of sounds and images extracted from various sources, including the Internet and DVDs, as well as diaristic material gathered by the artist and his friends. Various light distortions created with a small portable video camera add further texture to the work. Tapping into seamless image streams proliferated by the mass media, the work teeters between the sensual realm and something more anxious and violent, pointing toward the experience of existing in a constant, at times oppressive, dialogue with technology. Projected on opposing screens, the work switches from one screen to the other, requiring the audience to physically reposition themselves and unsettling conventions of more passive viewing.
