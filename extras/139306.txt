ITC Galliard is a modern revival of the historical serif typefaces French typographer Robert Granjon designed in the sixteenth century. The goal, Carter has said, was to "make a serviceable, contemporary, photocomposition typeface based on a strong historical design . . . not a literal copy of any one of Granjon's facesâ€”more a reinterpretation of his style." ITC Galliard is named for a popular renaissance dance, alluding not only to the time period in which Granjon worked but also to the playful choreography of his letterforms. The typeface is known in particular for its distinctive small capitals and its exaggerated characters and ligatures.
