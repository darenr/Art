Ernst was aligned with both the Dada and the Surrealist movements. Une Semaine de Bonté is one of his visual "collage novels": associative sequences of images made by combining illustrations from nineteenth– and early–twentieth–century pulp novels, scientific journals, mail–order catalogues, and  natural–history magazines.
