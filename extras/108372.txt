This work belongs to a limited series of threeâ€“dimensional drawings Ferrari made in the early 1960s, retrospectively called Writings in the Air after the title of a book produced by the artist and his friend the poet Rafael Alberti in 1964. A boxlike object, Reflections is contained by two flat surfaces composed of intricate, abstract gestural ink lines on paper and glass. The wires contained within it reproduce the convoluted lines of the drawing at the back of the box, one of Ferrari's stylistic signatures of the 1960s.  This three-dimensional duplication of a conventional drawing makes Reflections a material tautology. In that sense this work belongs to a very specific repertoire of Latin American Conceptual art that instead of producing art as ideas addresses material objects as concepts.
