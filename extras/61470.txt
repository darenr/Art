In the 1990s, American artist Kara Walker revived the art of the cut-paper silhouette, popular in nineteenth-century portraiture. Walker transformed this medium to suit her more transgressive aims, using the spare elegance of the black forms to depict scatological and sexually explicit tableaux set in the Civil War South. Walker uses humor and horror to address cultural issues of race, gender, and power. Her characters are drawn from stereotypes and engage in taboo acts of sex, violence, and debasement. African/American, a linoleum-cut print, conflates lyrical lines and disturbing content to elicit a range of emotions and reactions. Walker described the seminude figure as "your essentialist-token slave maiden in midair."
