These ten handmade, meticulously framed paintings are miniature replicas of works from Frank Stella's Protractor Series (1967â€“71). Beginning in the 1960s, Pettibone reproduced the works of many newly famous artists, including Robert Rauschenberg, Ed Ruscha, and Andy Warhol, on the heels of the originals and well before the appropriation of images became a standard artistic strategy in the 1980s. The scale of Pettibone's replicas is typically based on the size of reproductions of the original works in art magazines. While his diminutive copies raise critical questions about originality and authorship, they maintain a rigorous respect for craftsmanship and for the artworks they reiterate.
