When the group Joy Division was working with Saville on this design and asked him what he had in his studio, "out came Pierre Wolff, and images of tombs," as he would later recall, "because I think they look trendy." With hindsight this choice seems to have been aligned with lead singer Ian Curtis's suicidal depression. Saville was interested in creating a frisson from wrapping a neoclassical style of typography and subject matter "around a twentieth-century piece of vinyl, on which is the sound and language of 1980. The graphics are purely historical, but the totality is a modern mix."
