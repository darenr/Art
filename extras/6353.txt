The Deutsche Werkbund, a forward-looking association of manufacturers, designers, and architects that included Margarete Sch√ºtte-Lihotzky and Lilly Reich, helped position Germany at the forefront of the development of the rational kitchen. An international exhibition organized under its auspices in 1927 took the form of a modern housing estate, exemplifying an admiration for scientific rationale and efficiency. Architects collaborated with home-economics expert Erna Meyer on the design of many of the kitchens, including the example featured in this poster.
