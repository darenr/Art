Newman was one of several Abstract Expressionists who made paintings that downplay traceable signs of the artist’s hand. In The Voice, the paint is applied so evenly that the only hint of texture comes from the weave of the canvas itself. The broad expanse of white is interrupted by an off-center “zip” of slightly darker white. The title deftly makes use of paradox, as it contradicts the silent mood of the pure white field.
