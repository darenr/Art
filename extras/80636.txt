A self–taught artist, Sobel invented her own painting process. According to her son, "she would prepare a ground, which would invariably suggest or trigger some 'idea' for her, whose sudden conception was matched by an equally rapid execution. In her efforts to pin down her conception she would pour the paint, tip the canvas, and blow the wet lacquer." She made Milky Way quickly and spontaneously, achieving a jewel–like, allover surface by using fast-drying enamel paint. Her automatic technique has been likened to those of highly theoretical avant-garde groups like the Surrealists. She responded, "I only paint what I feel."
