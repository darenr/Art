The subject of this woodcut  a group of sensuous nude female dancers on stage, one in ecstatic frenzy  exemplifies the Brücke artists' bold rejection of bourgeois norms and academic conventions. The stark contrast between black accentuating lines and white areas removed with a gouge adds a rhythmic quality to the scene, while the looming black hat creates a jarring sense of spatial ambiguity by effectively merging foreground and background. This approach to form shows the influence of Matisse's Fauvism, which Kirchner saw in an exhibition at the Paul Cassirer Gallery, Berlin, at the beginning of the year. This woodcut is part of a large number of nudes and dance scenes that Kirchner concentrated on during his mid-Brücke phase from 1909 to 1911.
