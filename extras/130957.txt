Nielsen, a young metalworker, met his future wife, Marie Axelsen, when she was training to be a hairdresser. When they married, in 1939, Marie opened her own salon in Randers, Denmark, and Holger applied his skills to help furnish it. He designed the original Vipp pedal bin and made three of them for the salon. As his work attracted the attention of customers, he continued to fabricate them on request. With money from the sale of a car he won at a raffle (he had no driver's license), he invested in a metal-turning lathe and set up his own factory. Early Vipp bins were popular for medical offices, but they eventually expanded into commercial, school, and domestic environments. The name Vipp is onomatopoeic, taken from the Danish word for the lidâ€™s movement as it opens and closes.
