This group of Evans's photographs spans the divide between the vast array of New York City's buildings and bridges and the smallest of those structures architectural details. Whether taken from far above a street or construction site or from inches away from a grate, the images capture the gridded regularity of modern architecture, but also cut through it with diagonals made by construction girders or with plays of light and shadow. They suggest their maker's interest in the new forms and energy of a growing and changing city.
