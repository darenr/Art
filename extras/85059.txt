For the 1942 Ballet Theatre of New York production (premiere Mexico City). Choreography by Léonide Massine. Music by Pyotr Ilich Tchaikovsky In addition to designing the decor and costumes for Aleko, Chagall used line and wash to suggest overall stage compositions and body positions for the ballet's choreographer, Léonide Massine. The boisterous group dances accompanied by hand clapping and fiddle playing depicted in these drawings attest to Aleko's folk-inflected spirit.
