A pioneer of Conceptual art who also trained as a pianist, Darboven created a notational visual language based primarily on numbers and indecipherable script. Here, for the first time, musical notations dominate her project.  The scores are derived from a set of correspondences the artist established between numbers and notes; working with a composer, she orchestrated and recorded them. Visitors can hear her compositions alongside their visual equivalents.
