Throughout her career, Roni Horn has combined literature and art, turning her audience into what she calls "reader/viewers." "I'm especially interested in those divergent experiences," Horn has said. "That’s what I'm after. Similar things in different forms are completely different things.” Here, two slabs, each bearing the word "tiger," are presented as sculptures to be read. Together they provide the first two words of William Blake's 1794 poem "The Tiger."
