Reena Spaulings is a fictional artist and art dealer and literary persona.  Under her name, several artists conceived and executed this painting, which features a crudely rendered brick–and–mortar pattern,  The motif was inspired by the Lower East Side neighborhood in New York, where the Reena Spaulings gallery was first located.  Because the birck pattern covers both sides of the unstretched canvas, this work can be displayed in a number of ways: folded, open, lying on the floor, draped over objects, hung as backdrop, or in a combination of these options, as seen here.
