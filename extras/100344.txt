David Webster makes paintings of humans based on X-rays, magnified cellular views, and illustrations from medical textbooks. Every year, the artist switches his focus from one part of the body to another, and Cerebellar Islands is part of a series that concentrates on the human brain. Webster feels that microscopic structures, such as those of the brain, often resemble the things in the larger world; he has said, "The universe can be found within ourselves."
