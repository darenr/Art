This poster, a condemnation of the My Lai massacre of hundreds of unarmed civilians by US soldiers in South Vietnam, was conceived on November 25, 1969, at a meeting between members of the AWC and MoMAâ€™s Executive Staff Committee. The paper and printing were donated and color plates completed by December 18, but the Museum withdrew its support when William S. Paley, President of the Board, determined it could not take a position on any matter not directly related to a specific function of the institution. The AWC nevertheless released and freely distributed fifty thousand copies.
