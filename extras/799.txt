Peter Eisenman designed eleven houses between the late 1960s and the 1970s that explore the principles of autonomous architecture. In the drawing for House IV, designed for a site in Falls Village, Connecticut, but never realized, a sequence of axonometrics illustrates the transformation of a basic cube into a highly developed spatial configuration. Based on a generative rule system, in which each move is a response to the last, the cube is cut, extended, and rotated until the final form is achieved without regard to function and program.
