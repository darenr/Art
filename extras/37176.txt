Starting in the mid-1980s Kippenberger produced hundreds of drawings on hotel stationery. These drawings exemplify the almost absurdly prolific character of the artist's output as well as his refusal to conform to one technical or stylistic approach. An itinerant sensibility was central to Kippenberger's practice and was a constant source of his creativity. But while some of the stationery documents the artists far-flung travels, it also represents places the artist had never been, as he often obtained such sheets from acquaintances. Thus, like much of his work, the drawings both allude to and undermine the assumption that art is autobiographical.
