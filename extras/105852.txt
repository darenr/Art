A cofounder of the Judson Dance Theater in 1962, Hay was heavily involved in emerging performance art and avant-garde dance in the 1960s, and these interests carried over to his work in more traditional media. To create Ground Drawing the artist saturated a piece of cotton cellulose paper with liquid, then allowed it to dry  over a patch of ground in Venice,California, transferring the earth's bumps and irregularities to its surface. He then painstakingly traced each indentation, visually emphasizing the earth's physical unevenness and indicating the precise degree of each bump's incline. Hay's intense focus on an anonymous patch of ground draws our attention to the intricacies of the easily overlooked and ephemeral.
