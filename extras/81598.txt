Smith's work has a long-standing engagement with the body, calling attention to often overlooked aspects of human corporeality and sexuality. This work is composed of glass water-cooler bottles, coated with silver and etched with the names of twelve body fluids. By externalizing and labeling what is usually hidden inside the body—and allowing us to catch our own reflections in the silvered glass—this work emphasizes that we are all, like the bottles, containers for fluid. The German Gothic lettering in which the names are etched is a reference to a medieval book of hours, a Christian prayer book that provided, according to Smith, "some kind of meditation, something you could think about or believe in," for every hour of the day.
