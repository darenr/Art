Scher's groundbreaking identity and graphic campaign for New York's Public Theater set a new bar for typography of the 1990s. Using unorthodox spacing, mixing font colors and weights, and employing uncommon and often historic typefaces, Scher's text-heavy poster presents a large amount of information in a dynamic and expressive way. Fusing highbrow and lowbrow, this eclectic and irreverent approach signals Scher's affiliation with the New Wave graphic designers of the 1980s and 1990s, who rejected modernism's neat grid and cool affect. Scher's identity for the Public Theater places emphasis on the word "public" to position the institution as an affordable and accessible venue for all.
