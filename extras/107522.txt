Caldas's works often function as open questions, addressing such critical formal issues as the meaning of a void, the activation of empty visual fields, the ambiguity of perception, and the juxtaposition between objective names and nameless objects. Pontos belongs to a repertoire of works in which Caldas played with the visual meaning of dots: as chance-ordered forms or as repetitive figures, as a matrix for ideal architecture or as a metaphor for perceptual space. This work set the ground for countless others in which Caldas developed his early intuitions through abstract allegories that stress the complexity of visual surfaces through our experience of time.
