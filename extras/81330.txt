In the 1960s Nauman frequently involved his body in his work, primarily through performance and sculptural casting. Despite the claim made by the title of this work, the holes in the now discolored layers of aluminum foil, plastic, foam rubber, and grease do not actually correspond to the artist's body. The materials and irregular format of this work contrast starkly with the often geometric, industrially produced Minimalist art many artists were making at this time.
