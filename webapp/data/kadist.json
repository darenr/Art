    "artist_description": "Aaron Young's artworks rely on the aftereffects of dynamic, energetic, and sometimes even dangerous performances. He hires participants stereotyped as marginalized rebels, such as skateboarders and motorcycle riders, to perform various stunts in exhibition spaces on specially prepared platforms—such as the performance Arc Light for the exhibition, for what you are about to receive. Like Steven Parrino, Young uses destructive actions as generative force; the traces of his ephemeral acts are recorded as videos, drawings, sculptures, and photographs to constitute artistic artifacts.

    "description": "The artist describes the work as \"very performative video-pieces but they take on a more sculptural feel. The action is simple: I kick a video camera through a site that is embedded with sociological elements, which I try to question through my practice. I chose Red Square as the site to work in Moscow. The square is interesting as a kind of high/low, new/old dichotomy of a new capitalist regime, with the most expensive World-brands of fashion, design and architecture creeping in like a drug that everyone is forced to take but hasn’t been tested long enough to know the effects. All of this is in direct opposition to an almost outdated value system represented by Lenin’s tomb across the road. After summing up this pyramid of power and history, having it laid out in a square where there can be a final point… me as an American here performing a very minimal, radical action of kicking a camera over time within those parameters. The camera breaks down within three to four minutes, creating a time-based situation: the image that is being recorded disappears kick after kick and visually erases all the embedded history, the politics… the finished work lends itself to a social/cultural amnesia that I find exists in this place.\"",

The title is a reference to a building Frank Lloyd Wright designed for Tokyo, which was completed in 1923. In its heyday, which lasted until after World War II, the hotel was reserved for elite personnel, many of them foreigners. With the passage of time it came to be seen as outdated and dingy, and it was demolished in the 1960s. Cruzvillegas’s work ironically and humorously symbolizes the hotel imposing presence. He presents us with the ultimate symbol of democracy—a phonebook—pierced with arrows. The sculpture is a symbol of solidarity imperiled by imperialism. ",

    "artist_description": "Born and raised in Chicago, Adrian Wong was originally trained in research psychology at Stanford University. He began making and exhibiting work in San Francisco while concurrently conducting experiments on young children for his Masters degree. Wong’s training in psychology made him aware of the limitation of research methodology, which ultimately redirected his interest to other aspects of his research subjects: “I’m not looking for universal facts; I’m looking for more subjective and affective entry points.” He has been based in Hong Kong, S.A.R. since 2005, where he is the co-founder and director of Embassy Projects, an arts consultancy and independent production studio. His installations, videos, and sculptures draw from varied subjects and explore the intricacies of his relationship to his environment. These relationships, often relying on collaboration with subjects, take on modes of the experiential, historical, and cultural, at times, filtered by fantastical or fictionalized narratives. \r\n",

The geometric forms in the piece are welded together as a composite replica of a metal grate from a children’s playground next to Wong’s studio, a security grate door from his apartment complex, and the latticework that holds an air conditioner from an electronic store, and a front grate from an elementary school on his bus route. This melding is a recognition of objects that normally recedes into the background of one’s experience in the city by recognizing their role as partitions that break visual fields into parallax spaces or planes of movement.

Her cryptic comments on the cloudy morality of American culture are derived from pop cultural references including political figures like Richard Nixon, Hollywood films, and pop musicians.

Iron is one of nature’s most abundant metals. Smith, a philosopher of human detritus and poetic associations, presents it in this work as simultaneously everywhere yet paradoxically forgotten, lost in the heaps of refuse that fill junkyards and vacant lots. She thereby recalls and reclaims something important and elemental—indeed, a material that is integral to the physical fabric of culture and society, one that we associate with incorruptibility and malleability simultaneously.

Ruppersberg took as source material diverse items stemming from a distinct American form of popular culture of the mid-twentieth century. However, it was perhaps his particular use of everyday rituals to explore different cultural mythologies and narratives that separated him from many conceptual artists of his generation. For a period between the late 1960s and early 1970s, Ruppersberg developed several series of photographs that privileged a certain kind of neutrality, stillness, and emptiness that resembled the seemingly authorless images of mass-produced postcards or calendars. But in his works the artist often hid distinct clues, like an unopened newspaper left on an unmade bed in a hotel room. In this series Ruppersberg was also interested in the suggestion of narrative or uncanny storytelling through the juxtaposition or sequential arrangement of images.",

As with many of his other photographic series, the artist here inserted into each view a constant element that disturbs the otherwise quiet scenes: a hand holding an open magazine. By pairing each road sign with magazines as diverse as Playboy, Look, Hulk comics, Arizona Highways or Rona Barrett’s Hollywood, Ruppersberg teases the viewer to find a connection between the two.

The work underscores the intersection of everyday tasks and fantasy.

As Marcopoulos has continued to document his sons, and as they have become teenagers, the images of them begin to closely resemble the teenagers in much of his earlier work. The boys in Markopoulos' images have become less his sons and more anthropological subjects of study, the youths that started his photographic career over thirty years ago. Jackass is a perfect example of the full circle that Marcopoulos' career has made.",

The video presents us with a reinterpretation of footage from his unreleased avant-garde film, Easter Morning Raga, from 1966. In contrast to his more famous pieces like A Movie (1958) and Crossroads (1976) which are juxtapositions of fragments from newsreels, soft-core pornography, and B movies, the images in Easter Morning serve as a reinterpretation of footage. Here the artist expands the images in duration, gauge, and frame rate, which results in an enigmatic visual transcendence, or “imagelessness,” and distances the viewers from their preconceptions of what they are watching. Accompanied by rhythmical music, the collision of images in EASTER MORNING is not only testament to Conner’s ability to balance order and chaos, control and chance, but further reveals his abiding interest in alternative ways of seeing and experiencing",

It is a formal exploration related to many different things: the Rorschach inkblot testing used by psychologists, Japanese calligraphy, Egyptian hieroglyphs, and the intricate patterning Conner saw everywhere in the world around him.

Beneath the grid is an abstract composition that nonetheless alludes to some spatial arrangement, perhaps referencing an urban setting, with drips of black paint mirroring the look of quickly-sprayed graffiti.

Here, the two-dimensional old-school architectural renderings have become the foundation for new hollow three-dimensional structures.

In his solo work, Chen focuses his efforts on the new forms of perception of urban visions and life imposed by the age of information and global travel.

This “return to origin” reveals an interesting critical reflection on the interactive relation between outside change and internal reflection, and the possibility for more experimental approaches that revive “traditional media.” Chen’s series Collective Memories depicts some of the most important architectural works and urban sites in modern Chinese society, especially those related to the history of revolutions. Instead of reproducing the images himself, Chen invited the public to participate in their making by using their fingers to paint directly on the paper or canvas. The resulting paintings made from hundreds of individual thumbprints embody and metaphorize the fragility and uncertain future of collective memories in a time of rapid urban expansion and globalization.",

Along with artists such as Bahc Yiso, Beom Kim, and Lee Bul, Choi was part of a generation whose unique and varied practices gave rise to Seoul’s burgeoning art scene in the 1990s. Trained in Korea during a period of rapid modernization and economic growth, Choi’s work acknowledges and internalizes the processes of consumption and the distribution of goods and has resulted in his being recognized as the leader of Korea’s pop art movement. Often infusing his works with a hint of humor, Choi creates monumental installation with everyday objects. His works also touch on issues of accessibility in art and contemporary culture, concepts of individual authorship and originality in art, and they comment on the privileged environment of art institutions and the prized status of artworks amidst a consumer-frenzied world.\n",

Ironically, these public sculptures are usually also superficial and made from the same unnatural materials. Thus, while seeming to be a celebration of nature’s beauty and the need for imagination when living in an environment with a diminishing natural aesthetic, Flower Tree embodies the paradox of modern life.",

The perfect graphite renderings freeze the book with its pages splayed, wings perpetually open. But we cannot help feeling that the boundless generosity of Gonzalez-Torres’s piece finds a limit in Jacobsen’s unique, but copied, original.

The combination is peculiar because the role the explosion serves here is non-specific. The image loses its totemic weight, as it seems to not matter what particular explosion this is.

The title of the series is translated from the Khmer phrase Tuol Sleng, which literally means a poisonous hill or a place on a mound to keep those who bear or supply guilt, and the photographs came from the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum in Cambodia, a former prison where at least 200,000 Cambodians were executed during the reign of the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979. In this particular image, three men stand against the backdrop of what looks like a prison interior. Their identities are unknown. The ghostly, illuminated space creates a strange effect of time traveling, transporting viewers back to the historical event depicted. The men’s gazes seem to tell stories that have been buried in collective memory. For Lê, the act of appropriating, recycling, and remixing imagery is a means of rescuing both images and the memories embedded within them.",

    "artist_description": "Doug Aitken’s work started to draw international attention when his installation Electric Earth earned the International Prize at the 1999 Venice Biennale, which was organized by renowned Swiss curator Harald Szeemann. Interested in breaking conventional narratives, Aitken emphasizes circularity and non-linearity in his monumental site-specific installations. This monumentality is usually expressed in Aitken’s tendency to combine apparently disconnected fragments in order to create epic films. Although this aspect of his work differs from the all-encompassing wholes sought by modernism, Aitken’s films play with the imaginary and surreal in a way that flirts with  the notion of utopia. The artist uses pop culture and, especially, the film industry as sources for his compelling and immersive environments. Aesthetic elements such as coloration, light and space and a careful editing process give his films a contemplative mood.",

In this film, Aiken’s allusion to “the frontier” and iconic imagery like the cowboy suggest that the American West Coast as a cultural construction. These notions are reinforced by two key elements in the film: its protagonist, the iconic West Coast artist Ed Ruscha, and its reference to the cinematic and the experience of the movie theater. The film is structured as a journey in time, from day to night. The completed film was shot in different places around the globe, including Los Angeles, Rome, South Africa, and Israel, which suggests the blurring boundaries of the unknown and emphasizes both fictive and real landscapes.",

Through this act, the dogs simultaneously become sculptural obstacles and dancers. The trained dogs, Belgian Malinois, have become the new darling and weapon for both the US military, Border Patrol and US law enforcement in their fight against terrorism and illegal immigration; and well known recently for being the dogs that helped capture and kill Osama Bin Laden. The musical narrative for the video is a free-form cumbia music composed by the artist and members of the Los Angeles-based band OJO that mixes hints of cumbia with electronic and ambient sounds. The video captures encounters between cultural memory and trauma by using both ritual and performance, yielding the appearance and disappearance of a hallucinatory narrative into a psychological sound experiment.",

After the Indonesian Reformation in 1998, Nugroho started to use caricature in his work to criticize the government’s policies about democracy, freedom, and censorship.

In conjunction with the boots’ “arrival” in New York City, the postcards were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art. The project speaks not only to the reproduction and dissemination of images, but also about how the material reality of the images—their settings and their existence in mailboxes—was in stark contrast to the everyday lives of the people who received the cards. As with all “mail art” which had begun with the Fluxus movement in the late 1950s and was on the rise in the late 1960s, using the postal service enabled artists to completely bypass the traditional art-world distribution system, and allowed Antin to expand or compress time as the narrative required.",

The work featured in the 101 Collection, They Were Here (2010), constitutes a clear example. The 16 ft long tableau confronts the viewer with a seemingly paradisiacal scene: a tropical deserted island with white sands and blooming trees appears to be a coveted destination. However the scene quickly turns into a dystopian image, once one pays attention to the small details camouflaged inside it: an erupting volcano or a dead bird. Biernoff places a pair of binoculars in front of the painting to reinforce this idea. Looking through their fake mdf lenses, the painted landscape is rendered blurry. The whole scene acts up as the backdrop of a theater act and the prop quality of its elements suggests a certain lightness associated with utopian dreams.  ",

The movie’s acrobatic tracking shots and idiosyncratic mise-en-scène prompted Hollywood directors like Martin Scorsese to campaign to restore the movie in the early 1990s. In 2006, Dulzaides traveled to Cuba to remake a small part of the film which became Scene I Am Cuba, a two-fold narrative in which one story line is based on a real event, and the other is the process of turning evidence into the theatrical.",

This unforeseen deviation is dissected in terms of affects in the time frame of 5 minutes. The affects that emerge in the piece are characterized by a sense of movement between pain and hope, and a work of association between cancer and expectancy. The concept of resistance and fireflies is taken from [Georges] Didi-Huberman's work on the political relevance of the survival of fireflies as a metaphor for the contemporary importance of an intermittent resistance opposed to an inoperable, redemptive, absolute one.”",

The artist arrived a week prior to the opening with no artwork to install, and created three spontaneous works from locally sourced materials. This one was made of white plastic record sleeves that Orozco arranged on the damp roof of the gallery. He left it out overnight, and by morning there was a layer of ice coating it—a serendipitous frozen portable puddle. The work highlights Orozco’s flexible practice and trust in chance encounters.",

When exhibiting the work, the artist produces a false statement claiming that he has paid an illegal worker from North Korea to wear the suit and to maintain a lounging posture for a certain length of time. But both the performer and the financial transaction existed only in the text, truths concealed by the costume and social propriety. By interchanging physical realities and contexts and obscuring details, Gimhongsok challenges the effectiveness of visual and textual communication to create a potential moral anxiety in the viewers.",

    "description": "The American War, which takes its title from the Vietnamese term for what Americans call the Vietnam War, has toured the United States extensively with the goal of presenting a Vietnamese perspective of that history. The project began in 2005 when Fletcher visited the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City. He was shocked by images that depicted the lasting effects of the war and the atrocities committed by the United States. Fletcher felt it important that these images be seen and discussed within an American context and, using a handheld digital camera, he photographed all of the museum’s images and labels. At that moment, Fletcher’s project resonated directly with the American intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. The artist took extreme care in shooting the pictures from an angle that would diminish the flash reflection on the surfaces, and paid attention to capture the wall colors and the explanatory labels. In this sense, Fletcher’s re-creation of the Vietnamese installation not only shares  important information but also recontextualizes it in a way that comments on the subjective and constructed nature of representation, both artistic and historic.",

Peng sees himself as an intellectual who uses art and aesthetics as critical intervention. Believing that art should be a tool of propaganda with the potential to awaken the collective conscience, Peng explores the coexistence of oppositional poles as a type of cyclical relational structure. The joining of oppositions is visible in the work Both Died of the Nanjing Massacre (2009), which depicts the upper torso of Japanese General Tojo Hideki joined to the lower half of one of the 20,000 Chinese women raped by Japanese troops during the siege of Nanjing in 1937. In another work, Farfur the Martyr (2009), Peng Hung-Chih deployed a similar strategy by joining the body of the crucified Christ to the head of Farfur, a Mickey-Mouse type character, who hosted a children’s television show broadcast by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. Farfur, who was murdered on the show by an Israeli, “becomes a tool for anti-American and anti-Israeli sentiments.” To Peng, such inversions of meaning and intent “can be seen as a real-life theatre of the absurd.” \n",

Yet, the video shows a dog making phrases from the Analects appear by licking a wall repeatedly as if the dog is a medium channeling the spirit of the sage. Dispelling the magical with the wisdom of Confucius by ending with the sentence: “Confucius did not talk about prodigies, force, disorders, and gods,” the performance takes on the form of a miraculous apparition brought on by a prodigious dog, creating an ambiguous status for how the role of Confucius is received. \n",

He takes aim and makes a shooting noise; then, the camera reverses.

Each gesture reflects some essential social aspect of everyday life: hugging is about caring, taking oath has to do with politics, reading relates to acquiring knowledge, and raising a knife indicates violence. As a result of a hidden vibration machine, the images’ projection screens oscillate vigorously and the contradiction between the shaking screens and the static human figures creates an absurd effect.

    "artist_description": "Born in Sichuan Province, China in 1958, Wang Jianwei was trained as a painter at the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts (current China Academy of Fine Arts) in Hangzhou.\nDespite displaying technical virtuosity as a painter, Wang chose a working method that combines video, film and theater. Interested in combining the mundane, the historical, and the mythological, Wang’s works range from depicting the “plight of peasants occupying an abandoned housing project in Sichuan Province to films of post-1949 China during the height of Communist fervor and stories from the Tang Dynasty.” Particularly, poignant is the cognitive dissonance formed between presentations of the past and present in Wang’s work.\n",

The performance begins with two broad-knife-wielding characters circling each other in conventional operatic steps. Oblivious to the presence of these two on stage, additional characters, in a mix of period costume and contemporary dress, enter the stage in increasing droves to consume a various of foods laid out on a table until they collapse and pile on top of each other. Invoking the traditional Chinese theatrical trope of a “three-way fork in the road,” the piece ruminates on the representation of the visible and the invisible and the simultaneity of past and present as critical reflection on the shortcomings of both antiquarianism and technocratic modernity.\n",

Their bases rest in the observer’s space, and their varnished surfaces reflect the surrounding environment.

    "description": "Third Realm (2011) grew out of the artist’s long-term research of Indonesia’s colonial history and the processes of modernization and urbanization that have taken place there. Kuswidananto describes the nation as perpetually in an “in-between” state of transition. Thus he has developed the concept of a third reality, third space, or third body—an identity specifically for Indonesia that reflects its spatial realities and national character. The uniforms and horse saddles in the installation are of the type used in festival parades. Instead of directly commenting on colonial military history, the ghostly and bodiless outfits hauntingly suggest something out of the past. The addition of video and sound exacerbates this effect. This highly theatrical work not only reenacts traditional mythology but also foregrounds its unstable nature. It is intended to represent a shifting and changing milieu of ideas, events, performances, and meanings.",

Early in his career he made traditional, non-realistic, colorful, large-scale paintings that depicted everyday objects. Many of these took a somewhat critical tone that specifically addressed the cultural and societal dilemmas facing Brazil and its contemporary citizenry.

In addition to expanding women’s rights to encompass a greater freedom of artistic expression, Chicago expanded the definition of art and the role of all artists.

Inspired by new technologies in the auto manufacturing, these “Finish Fetish” artists appropriated industrial materials such as car paint or lacquer to create artwork with pristine finishes. Chicago too was interested in using industrial technologies and enrolled in auto body and boat building school. While the geometric forms, meticulously applied finish, and luminous, gradated hues of color in Domes speak to Chicago’s interest in the prevailing artistic themes of 1960s Southern California, its intimate scale, round shape, and triangular formation belie her career-long interest in using “feminine” forms to promote feminist issues.",

Uncommon sensation is a thread that runs through much of Hoeber’s work. The otherworldly springs from the readily available, unusually arranged. His paintings are situated somewhere between Modernism’s emphasis on the physical reality of the painting, Postmodernism’s fraying of that reality, and Op art’s insistence on playing perceptual tricks.\n",

With minimal edits, Gilmore’s formally considered videos feel incredibly intimate, but can also be painful to watch, as the camera unflinchingly documents all of her repeated falls and setbacks. Appearing strong but not invincible, she often dons pumps, pencil skirts, and other incongruously “feminine” attire as she throws herself into these strenuous challenges, suggesting an underlying feminist message about the 21st-century female experience.",

The  minimalist set of a table highlights the intention and persistence of the protagonist rather than technological innovation. The video manipulates the camera angle to distort the appearance of space so that Subbaiah’s repeated attempts at beating gravity can achieve momentary flights. As the flight attempts move into the bedroom, what first appears to be a close up of an alarm clock turns out to be an oversized ringing alarm clock further back to create a distortion of space through manipulations in scale.  Such effects highlight both the proximity and distance between apparent success and distorted perception.",

However, a closer viewing of the videos reveal that they were created by looping the same scene of moving fingers, giving the illusion that many bills are being counted when, in fact, only a few are in the scene.  Beyond commenting on the illusions of transactions and interdependencies in a regional economy, the video calls attention to the way media distort quantity as well as manipulations of values occurring with the transcoding of economic units into visual data. The false appearance of accountability presented in One Million and Two Million highlight the instability underlying the desire for convenience and efficiency in a globalized, media-dependent economy.

It features a flat roof, stone and glass walls, with rooms configured beneath a grid pattern of skylights and supporting cruciform steel columns. Rather than a distanced view of the overall structure—favored by modernist architectural photographers like Julius Shulman—Lambri instead works from the inside, focusing on Saarinen’s windows and the soft, even light. The resulting image is a poetic abstraction, an architectural photograph that yields not only a picture of a building, but suggests what it actually feels like to be in that architectural space.",

The facility was later used as a temporary prison to hold different people coming from Mexico to Los Angeles during the Civil War.

These props are part of a performance; he often sets up his studio in public and uses cues from his own journeys as the inspiration for his work.

Presented as a seven-channel video installation, Making Chinatown is an immersive viewing experience with different scenarios, lines of conversation, and background music, all merged together into one space where the sense of time collapses.

New Town Ghost documents a young female activist who is standing aggressively on a truck, rapping slam poetry through a megaphone to the rhythm of a nearby drummer. The two performers are from the Yeongdeungpo district, which has been drastically transformed by development from an industrial zone into a “new town” full of giant department stores and mega-brands. Yeongdeungpo is symbolic of many transformations witnessed by a young generation of Koreans. For Lim it is a dystopian place where the idea of a better future is simply delusional.

The laborers in the images are holding cans of kerosene and spraying it into the foliage. It was a common practice during the building of the canal for American companies and the military to import black workers from the Antilles Islands to spray kerosene to kill mosquitoes and prevent malaria. This practice resulted in massive health problems for the laborers and the disappearance of many species of local wildlife—not just insects but also plants and animals. With this work, Wheat uncovers and generates a space where the movement of objects (the movement of objects being the function of the Panama Canal) takes priority over life, art, and society itself.

The boxes sit on wooden pallets of the kind typically used for shipping; by painting them white and repurposing them as pedestals, Wheat removes them from circulation as carriers of commodities. The simple cardboard boxes are also discarded shipping materials. \nThe words “Be Oblivion” are a seeming command to fade away into obscurity. This simple phrase resonates as a harbinger of defeat. Perhaps the provocative installation is a pointed statement about our collective loss of power: in politics, commerce, war, international relations, social issues, or all of these.

Instead, McCarthy’s reconstruction divides the pants vertically in two black and white sections. McCarthy’s mistake speaks not only of the fallibility of memory but of a certain kind of queerness that resists any categorical—“black or white”—definition.

Zhang’s works deploy a variety of motifs and styles, at times dabbling in gender-bending photography and engaging in endurance-performances. Particularly, Zhang uses humor as an access point to expose the darker sides of capitalism in works such as Don’t Go So Fast (2009), social commentary on the state of economic disparity among social classes. His recent video installation and mixed media works has developed a sophisticated videographic language, exemplified by CCTV(2011) to address issues of state media, surveillance and privacy. Zhang considers China’s socio-political challenges to be unique to its own cultural-historical background and do not always translate or transfer well into foreign contexts. Thus, contemporary Chinese art can provide special visual entries into these complex socio-economic situations.\n",

The game is furnished with complete uniforms, a referee, and a midfield line.  Initially, the game appears as a whimsical solution to urban ennui. Yet, as the players shuffle the ball around, recklessly knocking down items in the apartment, the viewer begins to wonder if the indoor game marks the increase of air pollution, and the erasure of green space by real estate development has forced all leisure activity to be conducted in the prison of one’s apartment under surveillance.

After the narrative is fully formed, Qiu transfers each image by painting it onto a small canvas with acrylic, which can be quickly wiped away to prepare for the subsequent image or element to be painted on top. Such process distills an aesthetics of over-painting that drives narrative development through changing logical relationships between material and form rather than plot elements.\n",

Language is embedded in Foster’s work, but it is subject to play, often becoming obscured or reoriented. In Ghost I (2009) the word “ghost” becomes ghosted, rendered ominously in white chalk on black paper so that it resembles an apparition. Average Lifespan (2009) calculates the average lifespan of eight famous poets. This seemingly random equation reveals to us the age at which the poets died and forges a posthumous relationship among them. ",

Within my current work, dance and simple movement scores act as a language for simultaneously collecting, mapping and producing volumes of information and knowledge. Moving makes a map and performing is observation. Digital mediations translate bodies into uncanny organisms and minimal dances become distant accumulations of pixelated information. Entanglements between human physicality, technology and natural systems are imagined through a playful aesthetics of information. As every last body and landscape is mapped and measured, through rigorous technologies of ever increasing distance, I look for the newly emerging territories that mineralize at the intersections of the virtual and the physical. These are the territories that we live in, archived in the memory drives of muscles, or through endlessly shifting choreographies of information.\"",

The scene’s self-referential, transparent artifice insists that photography itself is also about performance, and that the medium’s potential to generate vivid fictions might be more interesting than its historical role as a supposed conveyor of objective reality.

When Kiyooka arrived in Vancouver in 1959 he was already one of Canada’s most respected abstract painters. His commitment to modernism at the time inspired a generation of Vancouver painters to reach beyond regionalism. In the 1960s and 1970s, Kiyooka began to write and publish poetry and produce photographic works. The best known of these, StoneDGloves, is both a poetic and photographic project. As Kiyooka began to reject the Greenbergian modernist aesthetic that informed his earlier paintings, he increasingly took up performance, photography, film, and music. He saw the position of the artist as being in opposition to the institutions of art. The shape of Kiyooka’s work, especially his photographs, is only now being recognized.",

In this animation, layers of images, abstract forms, meaning, and metaphorical associations slowly unfold at the same time that more visual myths are created. The identity of the protagonist, a red-coated official, is indeterminate and suggestive of both the mercantilist policies that led to the Opium Wars with China and the cultural authority claimed by the Company school of painting over colonial India. Though situated in a particular historical context, The Last Post remains an open-ended narrative with infinite possible\ninterpretations. The work’s scope and complexity is expanded further by its sound element, which was created by Du Yun, an artist and composer based in New York City.",

She has a background in dance and choreography, and by manipulating sequences of gestures with the traditions and techniques of filmmaking, Spong investigates how dance movements can register particular events in our collective memories. For Spong, the medium of film is an anthropological tool of inquiry in the search for history, narratives, and constructions of time and space.",

In the film, a female body conducts abstract dance movements on a beach, responding to the environment that surrounds her. This particular beach was one the artist loved as a child, but today it is hardly accessible because it is in the hands of a private landowner. Shot on 16-millimeter film through colored filters, the film has intense flashes of magenta, violet, and amber, and other flickering “light leak” effects. The female body appears and disappears intermittently, creating a surreal and mysterious presence. The overall effect suggests a precarious relationship between memory and experience, transience and monumentality.",

He graduated from the print making department of the China Academy of Fine Art in 2005, and, a year later, established π Animation Studio.

Because each frame was drawn by hand with crayon, it took Sun and his animation studio team a few years to complete this thirty-minute film of a surreal journey through mysterious cities, plagues of mosquitoes, broken statues, cawing ravens, waving flags, and flooded graveyards. Here, an ever-present man in a top hat makes obscure, cryptic references in scenarios that include the national anthem, factories belching soot into the threatening sky, and soaring planes dropping leaflets to earth.

Taken by the camera itself with the help of an mirrored optical device, these images narrate and reflect the camera’s own history and identity.  As with most of Lee’s work, this background information is not conveyed in any obvious way, but, instead, through allusions in titles and sleights of formal strategies.

In this, Lee is referencing Bruce Nauman’s multichannel installation Anthro-Socio (1992), which features a man’s head rotating as he calls out commands to the viewer.

Wearing helmets, face masks, and sun glasses, the riders attempt to shield themselves from the environment with armors sutured from cheap plastic material. They meander in a procession through a former scenic town near the Saigon River that has become the busy district of Thu Thiem. The precarious turns in the terse choreography is ushered by a soundtrack featuring Dmitri Shostakovich’s histrionic Suite for Variety Orchestra, Waltz no. 2, in which trombones and cymbals echo the increased tensions between the individual and the collective. As the riders break free of each other in a grand finale, the sacrifice of spontaneity in maintaining the mechanical rhythm of such an interdependent enterprise is underscored in light of individual freedom.",

    "artist_description": "Wallace Berman was one of San Francisco’s more important avant-garde artists and is considered by many to have been the father of the Californian assemblage movement (a title he could probably dispute with Edward Kienholz). Characteristically unruly, Berman was an active member of the San Francisco and Los Angeles Beat communities in the mid-1950s. In 1963 he settled in Topanga Canyon and started to develop the body of work for which he would become most famous. The verifax machine, a precursor of the photocopy machine, lent the name to the series of collages with which Berman experimented until his death in 1976. The structural compositional element that unifies the series is the image, appropriated from a magazine, of a hand holding a transistor radio. By photocopying and reproducing the image in sequential form on top of the canvas, Berman mimics the pattern produced by an old film reel. Inside the frame of each radio, the artist superimposed imagery—people, objects and symbols, often taken from pop culture—pertinent to that particular sequence of the work.", 
    "artist_name": "Wallace Berman", 
    "description": "While Untitled (Shuffle) presents the same formal characteristics as the rest of Berman’s verifax collages, this constellation of specific images inside the radio’s frames—the Star of David, Hebrew characters, biblical animals—have Jewish symbolism and attest to the artist’s lasting obsession with the kabala. The piece’s sub-title, “Shuffle,” suggests the presence of chance and randomness in any given organization of elements.",

These four locations are spiritual symbols and the subject of local cosmological beliefs, and the elephant has long been a cultural and religious icon. But there is something obviously strange about the images. Not only is the elephant proportionally unbalanced and out of place, but it is also upended and tied to a whimsical structure comprised of bamboo posts, wheels, and wood slabs. There is paradox created in the image by the juxtaposition of the immobile and sacrificed elephants and the symbolic sites creating a surreal and absurd effect.",

    "artist_description": "Receiving degrees from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2004 and The University of Leeds, UK in 2005, Wong Wai Yin experiments with a range of media that include painting, sculpture, collage, installations and photography. Her works recall 1960s conceptual pieces that question the process of art making, authorship and the definition of art as a unique original objects. Wong’s works call into question the role of art in contemporary economic structure and the arbitrary value given to works of art. This focus on the commodity also explores notions of quality, utility and value while challenging the beliefs generated about Hong Kong’s favorite middle-class pastime, shopping. Particularly, Wong makes her point through transforming mundane ephemera, such as things left in wallets or handbags, the everyday bits and pieces picked up from supermarkets into hand-crafted works.

    "description": "Tribute to Inside Looking Out--for the male artists along my way is a video work commenting on Inside Looking Out, an exhibition staged at Osage Beijing. The show comprised of six male artists who were friends of Wong’s during art school. Wong joined them in Beijing to set up for their show and opening, where she was introduced as the artist’s girlfriend, without any mention of her name. As a reflection on this incident as “the only time Wong thought about Feminism Art,” Tribute to Inside Looking Out shows an anonymous woman, Wong with her face obscured from the camera, hitting the artists of the show one by one with a folding stool, perhaps as punishment for the abovementioned sexist presentation. The willing submission of the male artists to the humorous yet violent act creates an ambiguous relationship between the power dynamics between male and female artists. The video ends with voices of men singing in unison Faye Wong’s “Easily Hurt Woman” (originally by Miyuki Nakajima) as if in an upbeat Cantopop military march. This ironic gesture, once again, reinforces through subversion the asymmetrical power dynamic demarcating artists of different genders and points to the changing meaning of a work’s content when performed by different genders.",

The video—located in an imagined contemporary Malaysian middle-class living room, a space of a fictive former imperial power—explores the precarious link between fact and fiction, fakery and authenticity by overlaying three believable, authoritative forms: a documentary, a website, and a realistic reconstruction of a contemporary home. It is rife with occidental colonial documents and exotic cultural artifacts—the trophy-evidence of Empire-making. The video parodies television networks and documentaries as researched authoritative forms of information. It begins by posing as a serious, believable work of non-fiction, but becomes increasingly unsettling with its inclusion of fictive events, memories, and histories around the urgent contemporary problems of migration, racism, power relationships, and empire making.",

Many of Capote’s pieces deal with Cuba and its relationship to the United States, referring to economic and cultural ties. His work also has a strong erotic element, depicting desire both between the countries and embodied sexuality. This facet of Capote’s work combines with and changes the minimalist forms that his pieces often assume, subverting their spareness.\n",

Capote’s model shows not just the proposed structure, but features figurines as well, to illustrate the possible scale and interactivity of the final piece.",

Canned Laughter is a detailed construction of Bergson, a fictitious factory that produces canned laughter for sitcoms. For it, dozens of ex-maquiladora workers were hired both as part of the research process (maquiladoras are highly secretive and it is very hard to know what happens inside) and as actors. Canned Laughter alludes to mechanized processes and to slavery in the age of globalization as well as to the impossibility to translate and reproduce true emotions though technological means.",

    "description": "Pacific Limn weaves together three narratives that comment on hyper-capitalism pan-Pacific cities that San Francisco exemplifies. Each of the large works comprise of moving images overlaid with giant text, all synched to a stealthy, up-tempo jazz soundtrack. In The Secret Life of Harumi, a Japanese woman fantasizes escaping her job and living a temporary dream life in San Francisco. Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries (YHCHI) uses locally sourced virtual products such as Adobe Flash animation and Apple’s Monaco or Menlo typeface to create a whimsical and indirect commentary on the psychology of the working class in an information society within postindustrial imperialism. For two months, YHCHI inhabited the economically polarized South of Market neighborhood, where a variety of socioeconomic realities overlap and coexist, from Facebook employees to the homeless. The Flash animation is influenced by realist cinema and depicts the tediousness in commuting by air and ground combined with the kitsch of an “Asia-town” window display. Overlaid with text-like femslash prose in a semi-coherent style of karaoke lyrics, the sensory cacophony disrupts a viewer’s thoughts and alludes to a desensitized boredom mixed with the desires of the alternative persona of a fictional Japanese woman.",

In this play of mirrors, the viewer first encounters his reflection, but in time the vibration distorts the image, making self-recognition impossible and suggesting the fragility of identity. Flutter’s reflective surfaces also evoke the architecture of office buildings that shake just so in an earthquake. ",

A leading figure of the Chinese avant-garde movement and a founding member of the artist collective “Pond Society” in the 1980s, he has developed a highly respected international career. Zhang’s earlier works experimented with the aesthetics of boredom and looked at themes of technological, social, and political control.

Zhang has been a mentor to many younger Asian artists working with new media.",
