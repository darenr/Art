These base components, pioneered by the biomaterial company Ecovative, are placed together in molds and allowed to biologically cement through fungal growth. When used as building blocks, the resulting mycelium bricks create a structure that temporarily diverts the natural carbon cycle to produce architecture that grows out of nothing but earth and returns to nothing but earth—with no waste, no energy, and no carbon emissions. This “low-tech biotech” approach offers a new vision for our society's approach to physical objects and the built environment through living structures that respond to current crises of material sustainability.","Fungus (0.951627), Natural environment (0.750227), Mushroom (0.723572), Mycelium (0.652413), Biology (0.605516), Carbon dioxide (0.594573), Yeast (0.580473), Carbon cycle (0.563142)"

Simon confronts photography's ability to blur truth and fiction—an ambiguity that can have severe, even lethal consequences. The primary cause of wrongful convictions has been mistaken identification. A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of photographs and lineups, a procedure that relies on the assumption of precise visual memory. But, through exposure to composite sketches, mug shots, Polaroids, and lineups, eyewitness memory can change.

In this diagram, Bayer imagined an arrangement of artworks on all six walls of a room, including the floor and ceiling, to create what he described as ""an inclusive picture of all [viewpoint] possibilities,"" inviting the viewer to look in any direction, rather than simply straight ahead, as in a traditional gallery presentation.Deschenes has brought Bayer's principle of ""extended vision"" to life with six photograms (photographic images made without using a camera) created by exposing photosensitive paper to the subtly varying light from the moon, stars, and surrounding buildings. The photograms act as hazy mirrors, reflecting fragments of their gallery setting back onto the other panels and onto the gallery itself, and at the same time accumulating traces of these settings as their surfaces oxidize in response to shifting atmospheric conditions.

In addition, the floor plans of individual apartments were modified during the redesign and customized to individual needs. The work was done in two parallel phases: as the prefabricated, modular facade structure took shape, the apartment interiors were modified and new openings created in the old exterior walls. Residents could stay in their homes or move into one of eight spare apartments in the building during construction. In a world of diminishing resources, this organic model of transformation and adaptive reuse is ingenious and exemplary.","Communism (0.915973), House (0.880267), Eastern Europe (0.846019), Real estate (0.819766), Europe (0.808219), Building (0.806254), Architectural engineering (0.787576), Tower block (0.698181)"

H.M. is a reconstructed portrait of Henry Molaison, known in scientific literature as Patient H.M., whose case is widely known for having revolutionized our understanding of human memory. In 1953, at age twenty-seven, Molaison underwent experimental brain surgery to treat epilepsy. The procedure left him with a radical form of amnesia that affected his ability to formulate new long-term memories; his short-term memory was limited to approximately twenty seconds, while his memory of events before 1953 was left largely intact. The work combines reenactment (Molaison and others who appear in the film are portrayed by actors) and voiceover (including commentary by Dr. Suzanne Corkin, a neuroscientist who worked closely with Molaison) with found images, text, and animation. A single film print is threaded between two synchronized projectors; through a modified looping system, two parts of the film (twenty seconds apart) are projected simultaneously, creating a dissonance evocative of what Molaison might have experienced. The fragility of film—which degrades each time its projected—resonates with the precarious nature of memory.

These images of the figure hanging above the crowd with his hand raised have been broadcast hundreds of times by CNN and other news channels over the last decades as a symbol of the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the failure of Communism. In this film, editing shifts into manipulation: it looks as if the crowd is preparing for and then celebrating the erection of the sculpture. The demise of Eastern European socialist regimes at the end of the twentieth century led to the removal of many such monuments, taken down by either the state or the people themselves in hope for a better future. For many this hope has not been fulfilled.

In designing his edition, Broodthaers blocked out the lines of the original work with solid black bars of varying width, dependent on the original type size, turning the original text into an abstract image of the poem (Broodthaers also replaced the word Poème, on the title page, with Image).

The work is based on a broken neon sign reading brühlzentrum (the name of a modernist housing complex) that the artist found in Leipzig, in the former German Democratic Republic; the sign was set to be demolished along with the complex. The artist refrains from nostalgia and seeks instead to situate the aesthetics of socialist modernism in the twenty-first century.

Eisenstein shot his film with the financial backing of the American socialist writer Upton Sinclair; Sinclair eventually withdrew his support and exercised his right as producer to have the film edited without Eisenstein's approval. In iconography inspired by Eisenstein's film and the murals of Mexican painter Diego Rivera, Fraser appears as a revolutionary peasant during a failed uprising at a hacienda. On the other screen, scenes representing the audience appear periodically, with Fraser performing as Frances Flynn Paine, president of the Paine Mexican Arts Corporation, an entity (funded by the Rockefeller family) that promoted Mexican arts and crafts in the United States in the 1930s. Paine was also the curator of Diego Rivera's 1931 retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art, of which Abby Aldrich Rockefeller was a founder. While Paine was passionate about Mexican culture, she found it necessary to couch her interest in ideological terms, suggesting that American support for the Mexican avant-garde would subdue the leftist politics of the leading Mexican artists. (A letter from Paine to Rockefeller is included in the installation.) The video installation's split-screen format is both a familiar convention of video art and a representation of the double role performed by the artist. It provides a framework for Fraser's examination of the fate of certain radical utopian and revolutionary impulses in twentieth-century art. Contrary to the common narrative of the failure of artists' radical aspirations, Fraser points to contradictions that recast those aspirations within a structure of conflicts internal to the artist rather than one of failure to resist external interference.","Abby Aldrich Rockefeller (0.982052), Museum of Modern Art (0.959945), Rockefeller family (0.861744), David Rockefeller (0.823304), Nelson Rockefeller (0.786688), Art (0.777519), Abby Rockefeller Mauz (0.77383), Diego Rivera (0.765357)"

Other frequent contributors included Ludwig Meidner and, later, Conrad Felixmüller and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. Adamantly opposed to World War I, Pfemfert skirted tightened censorship from August 1914 to October 1918 by treating contemporary events only through artistic and literary allusions. At a time when reading books by foreign authors was considered unpatriotic, he dedicated entire issues of Die Aktion to Russian, French, and Belgian authors and artists. In late 1918, however, Pfemfert resumed vocal political critique, siding with the radical left. His selection of prints, formerly varied, became overtly political. After 1921, he ceased art coverage altogether, decreased the number of issues, and used the publication exclusively as a mouthpiece for his own increasingly partisan views.","Expressionism (0.96335), Art (0.533703), Karl Marx (0.511033), Literature (0.498362), World War I (0.463235), Egon Schiele (0.411752), Vienna (0.365045), World War II (0.356217)"

On the company's hundredth anniversary, Carter created Bell Centennial, a typeface designed to solve a technical and aesthetic problem introduced by changing technology. Bell Gothic, the company's existing typeface, had been designed for use on a linotype printing press, and its letterforms became eroded when run through the new offset presses, especially when used in lighter weights. Printers attempted to correct the problem by adding more ink, overcoating the type and making the letters harder to read. Using CRT composition, Carter increased the widths of the letters to prevent the separation of strokes (where the leg of an h meets its stem, for example) or the crowding of letters at small sizes. Carter also compensated for the thin ink and cheap newsprint used for phonebooks by creating ""ink traps"" where the strokes of the letters come together; they fill in with ink, creating a well-formed (not over-inked) letter.","Typeface (0.980334), Typography (0.923124), Graphic design (0.690277), Printing press (0.619981), Printing (0.613154), Typesetting (0.608069), Bell Centennial (0.56083), Design (0.541711)"

The video follows the wall from its original setting in MoMA's collection galleries, where it was once home to the enigmatic work 3 Standard Stoppages (1913–14) by Marcel Duchamp, an artist for whom Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio have a long-held passion. At the time of the wall's extraction, while MoMA was undergoing renovation, the gallery was the home of the contractor's office. The fragment—showing the original white color and the layers of paint built-up over the years—was grafted to a bigger network of white walls within the Whitney Museum in an installation called Mural, in which these walls were pierced randomly by a programmed drill running on track. When in front of the MoMA “aura,” the drill changed its logic and made its holes in the form of a regular, even grid, as can be seen in the fragment shown here.

It was first performed at New York's Reuben Gallery on October 4, 1959. Kaprow had attended Cage's Experimental Music Composition classes at the New School for Social Research in 1958; while he was inspired by Cage, he moved away from time–based sound works into Happenings that soon evolved into the more conceptual art form associated with Fluxus. Kaprow later disassociated himself from Fluxus and rejected the word “Happenings,” choosing to call his works “Activities”: ""It was not intended to stand for an art form, originally. It was merely a neutral word that was part of a title of one of my projected ideas in 1958–59.

S. Bach toward the end of a period of several months in which he and Pablo Picasso worked very closely together, producing paintings in a style that has become known as Analytic Cubism. In Analytic Cubism space is very compressed and shallow, colors are reduced to a palette of tans and grays, and identifiable subject matter—here, the parts of a violin—appears only in flickering moments. With this painting Braque introduced imitation wood grain to Cubism. He had learned this technique while working as a housepainter, and the Cubist practice of stenciling letters—here, BACH, J, and S—was also inspired by Braque's commercial training. Picasso and Braque employed multiple modes of representation simultaneously: in this work, Braque combined virtuoso illusionistic wood grain with linguistic references and near abstraction.Braque was trained as a classical musician, and he thought musical instruments added a tactile dimension to the visual image: ""The distinctive feature of the musical instrument as an object,"" he said, ""is that it comes alive to the touch."" Johann Sebastian Bach, whose polyphonic compositions may be seen as musical analogues to the shifting planes and multiple perspectives of Analytic Cubism, was one of Braque's favorite composers. Rare for his work of this period, Braque signed his name prominently on the paintings face, perhaps to invite the slippage of sound between the composers name and his own. This is the second Analytic Cubist work by Braque to have recently entered the Museum's collection.","Cubism (0.989371), Pablo Picasso (0.930054), Johann Sebastian Bach (0.867268), Georges Braque (0.805477), Collage (0.805068), Juan Gris (0.719434), Gertrude Stein (0.676753), Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (0.672809)"

As their relationship unfolds, the story of her life in occupied France as the lover of a German soldier, as well as her subsequent condemnation as a collaborator, is interwoven with his horrific experiences as a survivor of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Both are married, to all appearances happily so, yet they are drawn to each other in subtle, unspoken ways. Director Alain Resnais's images and screenwriter Marguerite Duras's words present the story in a series of searing flashbacks, brief vignettes that sometimes leave the viewer unsure whether the date is 1959 or 1945. This jumbling of time produces a sense of timelessness, of course, but it also impresses one with the contingent nature of reality and, most importantly, truth. The two lovers, knowing their relationship is fleeting, challenge and soothe each other in equal measure, so as to savor every moment they have together. This lack of a traditional narrative structure, combined with the understated performances by Emmanuèle Riva and Eiji Okada in the lead roles, disturbed audiences in 1959, leaving many with the idea that Resnais, who had only recently turned to fiction features after a distinguished career directing documentaries (among them, 1955's Nuit et brouillard), was either incompetent or hopelessly pretentious.

On days he performed, visitors entered to find the gallery empty except for a low wooden ramp. Below the ramp, out of sight, Acconci masturbated, basing his sexual fantasies on the movement of visitors above him. He narrated these fantasies aloud, his voice projected through speakers into the gallery. This video documents the performance.The following text, which documents and transcribes Seedbed, was published in Avalanche magazine in 1972: . . . I'm doing this with you now . . . you're in front of me . . . you're turning around . . . I'm moving toward you . . . leaning toward you . . .  Under the ramp: I'm moving from point to point, covering the floor . . . (I was thinking in terms of producing seed, leaving seed throughout the underground area).  I'm turned to myself: turned onto myself: constant contact with my body (rub my body in order to rub it away, rub something away from it, leave that and move on): masturbating: I have to continue all day—cover the floor with sperm, seed the floor.  Through the viewers: because of the viewers: I can hear their footsteps, they're walking on top of me, to the side of me—I'm catching up with them—I'm focusing on one of them: I can form an image of you, dream about you, work on you.  . . . you're on my left . . . you're moving away but I'm pushing my body against you, into the corner . . . you're bending your head down, over me . . . I'm pressing my eyes into your hair . . .I can go on as I think of you, you can reinforce my excitement, serve as my medium (the seed planted on the floor is a joint result of my presence and yours). You can listen to me; I want you to stay here; you can walk around me; walk past me; come back; sit here; lie close to me; walk with me again.  Reasons to move away from a space: there's no need to stay—I've left something there, outside, that used to be here, inside—I've left something there that can grow, develop, on its own.  Reasons to move: I can move with an easy mind—what's left behind is safe, in storage.","Masturbation (0.945644), 2006 albums (0.923977), Sexual fantasy (0.863852), Kirk Cameron (0.648), Week-day names (0.6435)"

Dean often uses the sea and other maritime themes in her work, including the tale of Crowhurst, which has appeared in several of her projects.In 1968 Crowhurst sailed from England for a solo, round-the-world yacht race and never returned. In T & I Dean connects the tale of this lost sailor to the story of Tristan and Isolde—whose tragic love story also hinges on sea voyages—through her majestic depiction of a barren, rocky coastline looking seaward. This work, based on a found postcard, includes the white, cryptic notes that Dean often scribbles on her prints and drawings.

It presents nine compositions that translate sound into motion graphics. Maeda's children provided the impetus for this project; he sought a way to simplify their interactions with the computer. Rather than awkwardly manipulating a mouse or keyboard, a user of The Reactive Square simply talks into a microphone and the square reacts and morphs in response.In all, the Reactive Books compile fifty–two compositions that explore a spectrum of expressive possibilities for interactive media. The second book, Flying Letters, is a compilation of interactive typographic pieces. The third book, 12 o' Clocks, explores the theme of time by implementing time-based behavior into motion graphics.

In the film the teahouse—on the Japanese whaling ship Nisshin Maru—is the site of an elaborate tea ceremony and a visceral love scene between Barney and Björk. A storm shakes the ship, and the teahouse is flooded with petroleum jelly. The partially submerged couple undergoes a violent and ritualized metamorphosis into whales.To make this symbolic sculpture, Barney cast the teahouse in petroleum jelly. When it collapsed he cast the remains in thermoplastic, a durable industrial material. Thus the artist conceived a transformative process analogous to the harvesting and processing of whales and, particularly, to the extraction of oil from blubber. The film and sculpture both address the intersection of artistic, biological, and industrial transformations epitomized by imagery of the whale harvest.","Japanese tea ceremony (0.964719), Tea (0.76741), Tea ceremony (0.732634), Tea culture (0.709651), Cetacea (0.689993), Humpback whale (0.599217), Ritual (0.560401), Institute of Cetacean Research (0.55833)"

For this print portfolio, Walker layered her silhouettes over illustrations she reproduced from Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (1866), a compendium based on materials from Harper's Weekly, the most widely read periodical of the Civil War era. These illustrations, which provide insight into the racial injustices of the period, emphasize Walker's overall objective: to investigate race, gender, sexuality, and oppression in the antebellum South and American Civil War period and to examine the role they play in the stereotypes of today.In each print Walker sets up a dialogue between new and old imagery, masking certain details and bringing others into focus and expanding the narrative beyond the conventional telling of history.

According to his theory of Organic Functionalism, architectural form must be discovered rather than imposed, and should grow from the function of the building.

It was also motivated by natural formations, such as tidal pools and open-air arboreal canopies that provide shade from the sun. The design is defined by two elements: a translucent, permeable roof of interconnected canoelike shapes that cover portions of P.S.1's courtyard, and a leisure landscape with two long pools that creates new passageways through the monumental courtyard and provides an escape from the summer heat by offering new spaces for swimming and lounging.

Her work, like that of contemporaries Chuck Close and Gerhard Richter, is well crafted and labor intensive.Despite her unapologetically traditional dedication to illusionistic representation, Celmins's works are not traditional landscapes; nor are they romantic explorations of the sublime. Her elimination of a horizon line renders her visions thoroughly modern. Without this visual guide, these realistic depictions are ambiguous from a distance, and as a result they can seem abstract. When the viewer does register the subject matter — an infinite view of the ocean or, in this case, a comet moving across a starlit galaxy — the absence of a horizon line creates a sense of floating, over the ocean or out in space.

The Campana brothers avoid rectilinear, geometric construction suited for mass production in favor of a liberated, vital tangle of sensuous lines that make a virtue of the charming imperfections created by the maker's hand.

The Port Terminal's warped surfaces have been sculpted by a vascular network of ramps—the building's circulation routes. The irregular horizontal surfaces bend at crucial points to function as supports for vertical loads, eliminating purely vertical structures on the site. The embarkation and disembarkation decks flank the terminal, feeding passengers into the system of interlaced loops in the interior. The roof functions as a public park; its gently rolling surfaces of wood and grass create a vaguely natural landscape.The project is entirely indebted to the computer as a design tool. The architects embrace the computer for its ability to integrate information rapidly and to construct precise form–making instructions, designing a complex architectural entity in a relatively short amount of time.

He returned in 1982, 1983, 1984, and finally in 1990, working on the ground and from the air.In 1983 Gohlke wrote about the project: ""Mount St. Helens is in part a marvelous laboratory in which to examine the limits of photographic information. . . . [It] provides a theater in which the sublime can be experienced without embarrassment or irony. I feel that I encounter at Mount St. Helens, in a concentrated form, all the issues that inform my work.

Neto likewise proposes an organic relationship between life, nature, art, and science, creating anthropomorphic, microscopic-looking organic structures at a macroscopic level. In Lonely Deserts Neto depicts two curvilinear, membranal forms floating side by side in a layer of translucent substance. Surrounding the entities are dark, sinuous forms that penetrate their walls, suggesting fertilization by spermatozoa.Organic forms are also prominent in Neto's sculptures and installations, in which he re-creates on a large scale the inner surfaces of the human body—skin and intestinal tissues—with materials such as Lycra, foam, cotton, and nylon. His fabric sculptures are often filled with spices and exude aromatic scents that evoke memory and encourage human interaction.

This drawing is provocative at all levels, including its title. The phrase ""It's not the end of the world (remember me)"" could be uttered by Death, personified, facing humanity and its conceit, or by Lucas in a desperate affirmation of existence itself.","American films (0.932132), Young British Artists (0.864388), Conceptual art (0.84989), Art (0.774882), Paper (0.768667), English-language films (0.757694), Contemporary art (0.718157), Anti-art (0.647438)"

Buckingham transposes the London setting of Poe's story to the Vienna of Sigmund Freud and Graham Greene, tracing a young man's pursuit of a mysterious, older stranger through the streets of the city for an entire day and night. Failing to learn the stranger's identity or make a meaningful connection, the young man then begins the hunt anew.Poe's themes of doubling and shadowing, attraction, disorientation, and estrangement, physiognomy and typecasting, and self and doppelganger manifest themselves in the mechanics of the installation. Buckingham projects the film onto and through a semi-metallic, two-way glass screen that produces reversed images and multiple reflections of its protagonists. The twenty-four-hour narrative is condensed into a continuous, twenty-one-minute loop that evokes the young man's never-ending quest.

When a giant boar covered in writhing worms attacks a small village, a young man named Ashitaka bravely defends his community and is wounded in the ensuing battle. When his wound begins to fester, Ashitaka leaves his village to discover the origin of the boar's curse. He soon encounters Lady Eboshi and the inhabitants of Irontown, who have leveled the nearby forests for lumber. The woodland creatures, led by Princess Mononoke, battle the residents of Irontown in an attempt to preserve their once-lush forest. Only Ashitaka believes that humans and the creatures of the forest can peacefully coexist.Anime, the style of animation Miyazaki uses here, originated in Japan and evolved from Japanese manga (comic books). Anime films often include highly stylized futuristic environments and unnatural-looking characters. The narratives are frequently violent, with conflict, both physical and spiritual, at their core. Initially favored by adolescent viewers, traditional anime films and current commercial offerings such as those directed by Miyazaki, Katsuhiro Ôtomo, and Isao Takahata now appeal to a more demographically diverse audience. In Princess Mononoke Miyazaki comments on contemporary debates about irresponsible manufacturing practices, climate change, and the intrusion of development on nature by deftly creating an allegory of conflict between humans and the natural world.","Studio Ghibli (0.970949), Hayao Miyazaki (0.970383), Anime (0.657617), Princess Mononoke (0.652893), Isao Takahata (0.61697), Japan (0.587301), Spirited Away (0.56794), Manga (0.537699)"

In 1987 Baumgartner began experimenting with the medium of woodcut, the oldest printmaking technique and one with a great tradition in her hometown of Leipzig, Germany. Since the 1990s she has worked exclusively with a horizontal line structure in her woodcuts, basing many of her compositions on her own video stills.Transall is Baumgartner's largest woodcut to date—over fourteen feet in length—and, remarkably, it is based on a newspaper photograph only inches in size. The print depicts a lineup of aircrafts waiting to be deployed, their power restrained, for the moment, by their stillness. (The title refers to the Transall C-160, a military transport aircraft developed in the 1960s and used over the decades for cargo, refueling, and surveillance.)To create this print, Baumgartner used a computer to magnify the image and transfer it onto an enormous woodblock for carving. Over a period of ten months, the artist laboriously incised hundreds of horizontal lines, until the complete image was realized and ready for printing. Its horizontal construction is emphasized by the panoramic format of the paper, which in turn underscores the magnitude of the aircrafts' wingspans. The density of the black-and-white linework produces optical sensations that give the illusion of vibration—an effect that enhances the tension between movement and stasis in the image itself.","Printmaking (0.980088), Woodcut (0.831262), Woodblock printing (0.632112), Printing (0.616907), Transall C-160 (0.585763), Old master print (0.575863), Optics (0.571191), M.

The solution was to create a long ribbon of fabric composed of various panels that blend together seamlessly. Although a single fabric panel may be used individually, larger sections work as multipatterned elements that can be mixed and matched.To obtain a different pattern for each textile panel, Jongerius uses Jacquard loom technology, in which punch cards are fed into a loom to control the weaving process, allowing for tremendous flexibility and complexity in the woven patterns. Jongerius plays with the notational alphabet used in the manufacturing process by printing these characters in a layer of white lacquer over the Jacquard patterns.

To celebrate his legacy, no object is more appropriate—and more attuned to the theme of this exhibition—than the ubiquitous soy sauce bottle he designed for Kikkoman. Post-World War II Japan found itself in an identity crisis; its citizens had to hold on tight to their history, culture, and cuisine despite the desolate feelings and the practical effects brought by a devastating and momentous defeat. Soy sauce, a staple of the Japanese diet for hundreds of years, found itself at the forefront of this historical challenge, but the brand needed a boost of modernity. Soy sauce was originally sold in 1.8 liter bottles, both unwieldy and unsightly, and the design of a new bottle rested on fixing those two problems. Ekuan, a former Buddhist monk working at GK Design Group in Japan, set out to redesign the soy sauce dispenser for the company Kikkoman. The bottle had to fit in with the minimalist Japanese aesthetic and be comfortable to hold— goals he achieved by designing a wide-bottomed bottle that tapers at the neck and ever so slightly funnels out at the very top. The see-through glass, functional in that it allows the consumer to see how much soy sauce is left and beautiful in its simplicity, contrasts with a bright red cap that adds visual depth to the dark sauce. The spout posed the greatest dilemma, as soy sauce has about as much viscosity as wine: none at all. Ekuan developed close to one hundred models, none of which succeeded in both preventing drip and controlling flow. An inward angle on the tip of the spout proved the right solution, preventing the sauce from pooling in the spout and dripping onto the table. More than three hundred million of these bottles have been sold worldwide.","Design (0.951645), Design management (0.781573), Glass (0.761917), Kikkoman (0.71115), Condiment (0.660066), World War II (0.624823), Japan (0.59879), Bottle (0.595821)"

In Eisenman's design (which was never built), the thirty-four-story building vertically folds on its core to create a structure that separates, transforms, and rejoins itself horizontally at the roof level.The form was generated by three operations performed on a Möbius strip, a three-dimensional geometric form with a single continuous surface. In the first operation, planes were generated from the triangulation of surfaces, which permitted the development of a surface order for exterior cladding and a trussed structure for vertical and lateral support. The second operation inverted the strip, triangulated the surfaces again, and imprinted the outlines of these surfaces on the initial form. The third step folded large public spaces between the grid and floor plates of an already folded structure. The building, whose height and creased form create an imposing presence, reflects a continually shifting urban paradigm.","Unter den Linden (0.956612), Brandenburg Gate (0.775314), Friedrichstrae (0.644786), Berlin Wall (0.580855), Angle (0.555754), West Berlin (0.546489), Eastern Bloc (0.537745), Berlin (0.516191)"

He grew up during the devastation and oppression of the Cultural Revolution (1966 – 76) and then experienced life in its aftermath, but he became disillusioned when the push for democracy ended with violence in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Fang often uses subtle humor and sarcasm to hint at the absurdities and uncertainties of life in contemporary China. His compositions are typically based on the figures of anonymous, shaven-headed men, composed in ways that create ambiguous social and emotional readings. For example, in 2003.2.1 is the crowd looking up and exclaiming with awe or grimacing in fear?Following a 1995 trip to Norway, Fang adopted Edvard Munch's technique of cutting his woodblocks into pieces like a jigsaw puzzle, inking them separately in different colors, and then reassembling them for printing. The scale of Fang's work, however, is virtually unprecedented in printmaking. Made up of seven contiguous thirteen-foot vertical scrolls, 2003.2.1 is a woodcut mural. This combination of the traditional Chinese scroll format with the bold figuration of Communist propaganda posters and a deliberate rawness inspired by modern Western woodcuts embodies an extraordinary moment of transition in Chinese art and culture.","Woodcut (0.968917), Woodblock printing (0.822007), Mao Zedong (0.750523), Tiananmen Square (0.748214), Edvard Munch (0.732135), Cultural Revolution (0.731029), Printmaking (0.695855), Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 (0.658334)"

Following his interest in the potential of storms, earthquakes, and sociopolitically disruptive events to inspire new architecture, Woods invents dynamic forms in response to rapidly changing contemporary urban cultures and environments. He depicts fields of expansive energy through extremely dense, dark accumulations of acutely angled lines and shapes that fill the entire page with artificial landscapes and border terrains, offering a critique of the existing architectural landscape by planting the seed for a cultural and material alternative.","Architecture (0.959225), Theory of Forms (0.798978), Urban planning (0.755039), Architect (0.751875), Space (0.671051), Energy (0.664067), Aristotle (0.627682), Construction (0.626777)"

Kahn died suddenly in New York's Pennsylvania Station in 1974, he was seventy–three years old and deeply in debt, and he left behind three families—one legitimate, the other two not. Nathaniel, born of one of Kahn's mistresses, was the youngest survivor, only eleven years old when his father died. My Architect is the adult Nathaniel's attempt finally to come to terms with his father's life and work. The film approaches the elder Kahn in two ways, through his buildings and through interviews with those who knew him best: family, colleagues, and acquaintances. Nathaniel visits and films himself interacting with such famous structures as the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, the capitol building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and the library at the Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire. Architecture luminaries I. M. Pei, Philip Johnson, Robert A. M. Stern, and Frank Gehry, among others, speak to Nathaniel about his father's professional methods and legacy, as well as about his troubled personal life. The most affecting footage is of Nathaniel's mother and his two siblings, testimony that is all too brief and on which he fails to elaborate, but which nevertheless provides much–needed insight into the personality of the famous man. In the end, Nathaniel Kahn never does gain full knowledge and understanding of his father, yet he does achieve a kind of grudging peace within himself, as well as a deeper appreciation of his father's considerable achievements.","Phillips Exeter Academy (0.985639), Louis Kahn (0.837219), Daniel Webster (0.829596), Phillips Academy (0.823004), Harvard University (0.800915), Phillips Exeter Academy Library (0.782136), Franklin Pierce (0.770448), Salk Institute for Biological Studies (0.769207)"

He has said that such images are, on some level, ""pictures of oneself."" The absence of a margin on this print emphasizes the fact that Dunham's shapes cannot be contained and are part of the artist's endless theater of evolution, suggesting multiple possibilities and interpretations well beyond their comic simplicity. With such works, Dunham enriches the long tradition of expressionist abstraction by returning to the irrational world of Surrealism and expanding on the imaginary universes of such figures as artist Philip Guston. Dunham began making prints in 1985 at Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE) at the invitation of Bill Goldston, who followed Tatyana Grosman as director there in 1982. Dunham was part of a new generation of painters for whom printmaking would assume a major creative role. This is confirmed by his statement that printmaking is now ""a part of the way I think."" To date, he has made approximately sixty prints, at ULAE and at several other workshops. This print owes its unusual Braille-like surface to a technique pioneered at Two Palms Press by printer David Lasry. The technique uses a 750-ton hydraulic press, formerly employed commercially for molding rubber. Rather than simply printing on paper that is laid over a woodblock, the press molds the paper under enormous pressure, creating deep, sculptural relief. The wood-grain markings seen here are a descendant of Dunham's painted abstractions on wood veneers in the 1980s. In fact, his biomorphic figures emerged from those earlier tangles of lines and shapes. Tactility and surface projections also find precedence in Dunham's paintings, as in works of the 1990s that include Styrofoam balls adhered to their surfaces.","Printing (0.9745), Printmaking (0.755806), Woodcut (0.546212), Abstraction (0.480313), Printing press (0.465541), Painting (0.438982), Edition (0.432988), Press (0.42824)"

As a sculptor and printmaker, she blends figurative and abstract traditions with social concerns, and has maintained a deep belief in the democratic power of printed art to reach a large audience. She has completed some eighty prints in woodcut, screenprint, lithography, and, most importantly, linoleum cut, a technique she learned at El Taller de Gráfica Popular (People's Graphic Workshop). This renowned workshop and artists' collective was first visited by Catlett while she was in Mexico City on a fellowship in 1946. The workshop's aim is to continue the Mexican tradition of socially engaged public art. It specializes in linoleum cut, as it is a technique that is easy to work with, produces inexpensive prints, and can accommodate large editions. Catlett's attraction to Mexican printmaking reflects a social and political concern she shares with the great muralists. Like them she uses her art to advance causes of particular interest to her, including the African-American experience and the plight of the lower classes. Many of her prints show the multidimensional aspects of women as mothers, workers, and activists. Sharecropper evokes Catlett's belief in the strength and dignity of the working poor, while it also offers a heroic portrait of this anonymous woman. She also depicts great women from African-American history, including Harriet Tubman, who is shown here leading slaves to freedom as a ""conductor"" on the Underground Railroad. Catlett's continued support of the civil rights movement in the United States during the 1960s is visible in the print completed after Malcolm X was shot and killed. It expresses Catlett's enthusiasm for the leader's successful efforts in inspiring pride in African-American women.","Printmaking (0.976375), Harriet Tubman (0.664281), Slavery in the United States (0.55653), Printing (0.547667), Underground Railroad (0.544625), African American (0.505939), United States (0.423579), Linocut (0.419406)"

Each drawing reproduces a page from the original publication, which comprises introductory texts and photographs. Bryce's work appropriates imagery from mass culture, using decontextualization and irony to question cultural stereotypes. In carefully rendering the printed pamphlet as individual ink drawings, the artist emphasizes his technical ability and individual subjectivity and simultaneously draws attention to the language, images, and function of this type of tourist literature. The choice of a Department of Defense pamphlet from the Cold War period is not accidental. The text combines descriptions and illustrations of architectural landmarks, ethnic types, and natural resources designed to educate American military person nel about cultural norms and the economic importance of the region for the United States. From our contemporary perspective these representations of Latin America as a potential economic resource for the U.S. government—one populated by flamboyant dancers, picturesque Indians, and rural laborers—open themselves up to varied interpretations. Rather than attempting to copy the pamphlet's appearance exactly and risk confusing his duplicate with the original, Bryce has purposefully reproduced the 1958 standardized typeface in ink by hand. Likewise, rather than emulating the slick, hard-edged appearance of the printed photographs, he has used a range of brushwork to create the effect of light and shadow. Through such intentional contrasts between the original and his renderings, he calls attention to his technical repertoire and mastery of the medium. Bryce has referred to his working method as ""mimetic analysis,"" underscoring his subjective response to his sources.1 Thus the specificity of his point of view invites the viewer's own participation in the interpretation of such works, as both artist and spectator question the often-taken-for-granted ""neutrality"" of tourist literature, in this case the 1958 pamphlet South of the Border.1.

Through his boldly colorful work, he strives to forge an emotional connection with the user.The Pratt Project, produced for the Pratt Institute in New York, is a series of nine experimental chairs formed by hand–injecting urethane resin of increasing densities into molds. The first chair is so soft that it cannot support even its own weight, and it collapses in on itself; only the ninth chair is strong enough to support an adult. The third chair, shown here, stands precariously on its warped base, although it is strong enough to support the weight of a small child. The swirling pattern of brightly multicolored urethane is made possible by the injection–molding process; the variations in color emphasize the sinuous lines that result from the material's deformation. In this project Pesce explores fully the material properties and possibilities of urethane resin; in doing so he also calls into question the nature, form, function, and permanence of the chair itself.","Pratt Institute (0.907163), Chair (0.816496), Charles Pratt (0.751477), Chairs (0.736346)"

With an acute sensitivity toward materials and composition, Tuttle combines elements such as plywood, cardboard, string, wire, and Styrofoam with more conventional artistic mediums, creating meaning through the simplicity, subtlety, and ambiguity of his designs. The specific placement of his work within an exhibition space is often a component of his practice, further choreographing the viewer's encounter with the work. Also deeply committed to poetry and text, Tuttle regards art as a form of language. This interest led to his first artist's book in the mid-1960s. Since then he has produced an eclectic body of works in this format, ranging from small commercially fabricated booklets to deluxe editions, numbering more than one hundred in all. In the early 1970s he began making prints and has since experimented with a variety of techniques, producing more than two hundred works, many as multipart projects. Tuttle's passion for gesture and materials, particularly paper, coalesced in the production of this suite. Invited to collaborate with the innovative papermaking workshop, Dieu Donné Papermill, the artist produced translucent handmade paper watermarked with a diamond pattern. He then added a variety of delicate lines in a transfer process by laying down and removing pieces of thread he had dipped in pigment. These sheets of paper were attached to different colored mounts and encased in artist-designed frames with striped coloration. Although related, each unit differs in its marks and mood, underscored by titles referring to the times of day. Using the same deliberateness with which he designed the compositions, Tuttle makes specific recommendations as to their installation.","Paper (0.97048), Papermaking (0.830928), Art (0.808699), Sculpture (0.607726), Watermark (0.568459), Painting (0.532038), Installation art (0.492374), Abstraction (0.484378)"

His work also includes such subjects as bestiaries, lyrical landscapes, and illustrations for children's stories and other literary works. Fascinated by the political prints of Mexican artist José Guadalupe Posada, Frasconi began his seven-decade career as a satirical cartoonist. Raised in Uruguay, he has lived in the United States since 1945, when he received a scholarship from the Art Students League in New York. An admirer of German Expressionist and Japanese woodcuts, he did much to sustain interest in the medium at mid-century and, of the three thousand prints he has made, most were executed using this technique. For his books, numbering more than one hundred, Frasconi makes full use of page sequencing to create visual narratives into which he often incorporates fragments of text with fonts he has designed himself. An indefatigable craftsman, he does his own printing, but has also reproduced some books photomechanically so they can be distributed more broadly through inexpensive trade editions. Viet Nam! alternates woodcuts of war-torn victims with relief halftone prints of sleek B52 bombers, both based on newspaper photographs. The interleaving of white, red, black, and translucent papers, sometimes left blank or repeating previous pages, creates a cinematic rhythm. In Los Desaparecidos, Frasconi pays homage to citizens of Latin America who, because of their suspected dissent, ""disappeared"" during the period of military dictatorships there. Here he exploits the raw immediacy of wood grain and experiments with scale to achieve powerfully confrontational effects. Political themes, like those explored here, have been a passion for Frasconi. He even taught a course in the use of art as social statement during his long tenure as a professor at the State University of New York at Purchase.","United States (0.984395), Woodcut (0.878496), Forced disappearance (0.76271), Printmaking (0.761667), Wood (0.705845), Literature (0.641802), Art (0.627852), Latin America (0.622858)"

After emerging in the 1980s with confrontational sculptures of human figures and body parts, Smith shifted her focus in the mid-1990s to the natural world, depicting birds, other animals, and the cosmos in sculptural works as well as prints and books. For Smith, who was raised a Catholic, birds have a particular significance, both as a reference to the poignant beauty of the environment and as a symbol of the Holy Spirit. Here, the authoritative majesty of the peacock's frontal stance reflects the artist's appreciation of this rare and magnificent creature.Smith considers printmaking a vital part of her work, and she has become one of the most innovative and committed printmakers of the last two decades. She has said, ""I could just make prints and be satisfied."" To date, Smith has published over 150 prints and books, in formats ranging from monumental multimedium prints and elaborate livres d'artiste to screenprinted tattoos and rubber stamps. When she began working with imagery of birds and other animals, Smith discovered the detailed, refined line available in etching, and found it an irresistible medium for describing feathers and fur. In Peacock, her markings are so dense as to almost obscure the bird's face and body and turn the image into an abstraction. The formal delicacy of this work is enhanced by Smith's overt passion for the inherently tactile qualities of paper—a material that she has explored extensively in sculpture. Smith likes to work with translucent, skinlike sheets of handmade paper, folding them, pasting them together, and otherwise manipulating them in inventive and unexpected ways.","Printmaking (0.955619), Sculpture (0.701575), Museum (0.645545), Nature (0.606433), Holy Spirit (0.583697), Natural history (0.565818), Printing (0.565813), Paper (0.539554)"

Adding to this expressive character is the work's monumental size and handcrafted, sculptural quality, a product of the thirty-six sheets of handmade Thai paper Smith attached together to form this tactile, almost blanketlike, fifteen-foot work.An artist for whom printmaking and sculpture are equally important, Smith produced this work in the late 1980s, when a resurgence of interest in figurative art was often manifested in provocative ways.

Roach, Director","2/13/2003","Drawings","Y","8.2003","2002","(British, born 1962)","Y","87811","Geezer is part of a large body of work by Lucas dedicated to Charlie George, a star player of one of the top London soccer clubs during the 1970s. Lucas grew up in the same gritty working-class neighborhood as George, who in the artist's youth represented dreams of stardom and escape. Here, in a portrait comprised primarily of collaged pizza-parlor advertisements, Lucas uses her relationship with the soccer star as a touchstone for a complicated investigation of identity, success, and marketing.While George is the ostensible subject of the portrait, the figure bears an uncanny resemblance to Lucas, whose work typically explores androgyny, the hybridity of personal identity, and double meanings. Indeed, Geezer can be understood as a kind of self-portrait connecting the artist's personal history with that of the soccer star's. However, Geezer is infused with a biting political critique as well. By rendering the face of the portrait from advertisements—the only legible identifying characteristic in the drawing is the logo of George's team, Arsenal—Lucas seems to speak to the commodification of bodies in sports, and in society generally.

Raised in a family of farmers in a rural area on the Danish-German border, he had been expected to carry on in this vocation but instead turned to furniture carving and, later, to painting. Through his art, however, he maintained a link to nature and the land. Over the course of his career, Nolde made some five hundred prints in a consistently experimental manner during short periods of sustained activity. He learned the woodcut technique from the young artists of Brücke (Bridge), a group he joined briefly, working in a decidedly painterly fashion by brushing compositions onto woodblocks before carving them. The simplification and direct impact of his imagery are indebted to his study of tribal art. In etching, breaking with picturesque conventions of the late-nineteenth century, Nolde created irregular tonal passages through unusual applications of acid to his printing plates, and formed bold masses of tangled lines and textures by scratching with a variety of tools. In his Hamburg Harbor series, he turned an industrial hub into a timeless metaphor for man's impact on nature, all through the mysterious effects of his etching process. In lithography his interpretations of a young couple are neither abstract nor fully articulated. As his organically shaped figures merge with an indeterminate landscape, they embody Nolde's fluid and intuitive technique as much as the psychological tensions between the sexes. All of Nolde's innovations in printmaking were carefully documented by the artist in an archive that was, tragically, destroyed when his Berlin studio was bombed in 1944.

As its clever marketing slogan ""reduced to the max"" suggests, the Smart Car has been developed to maximize the convenience, comfort, and safety of driver and passenger, while minimizing the impact on the environment. Low fuel consumption (averaging 49 miles per gallon) and eco-friendly methods of production distinguish this two-passenger car from the others on the market.The Smart Car was developed in the early 1990s at the Mercedes-Benz design studio in Irvine, California, where a team of engineers and designers, led by Gerhard Steinle, created the prototype. The design and marketing strategy was further developed with input from the Swatch watch company. Cars are sold at ""Smart Centers"" throughout Europe, where the brightly colored vehicles are stacked in towers like objects in a display case, clearly aimed at youthful, style-conscious consumers seeking an affordable car. The Smart Car's body reveals a clear, functional, modular design. The black frame of reinforced steel—the so-called Tridion safety cell—gives the vehicle its inherent strength. The safety cell defines the car as an integral unit, enabling the Smart Car to be conveniently short for a city car, without the front and back ends that project beyond the passenger compartment in a conventional vehicle. The steel frame is coated with powder paint, considerably less harmful to the environment than conventional painting processes. Colorful, lightweight body panels made of recycled plastic are virtually dent-resistant and rust-free. They are easily exchanged for a new set whenever the owner wants to change color. The interior is unexpectedly spacious. The engine is located below the passengers, allowing space to be conserved and seats to be given additional height.

Beginning in the mid-1960s, with a simple artistic vocabulary of lines and cubes, LeWitt used systems to devise an art free from stylistic and iconographic associations. It was the ideas that underlie and inform these systems that became the content of his work. Prints and portfolios have been an exceptionally fertile vehicle for him to experiment with such conceptual strategies and have become an integral part of his overall approach. He has completed nearly three hundred editioned print projects and more than fifty artist's books as his work evolved from rigorous studies of straight lines and primary colors to looser investigations of curving forms and luscious overlapping tones. LeWitt was immediately drawn to etching because of its inherently linear nature, which allowed for extended exploration of his compositional ideas. In this first portfolio of etchings, from 1971, he printed the entire series of ten works from only two plates, rotating and overprinting them in various configurations, incorporating the printing process into his systemic approach. Since the mid-1980s he has repeatedly depicted three-dimensional forms in his wall drawings and works on paper. In a recent tour-de-force series of five linoleum cuts, he distorts, elongates, and compresses the cube in a Mannerist study of perspective and shape. The twenty-one cubes were carved on separate blocks, which were then assembled like a jigsaw puzzle into a rectangular frame. Each print in the series reflects one of four possible configurations of the twenty-one blocks with concurrent changes in color. In typical LeWitt fashion, he experimented with printmaking's flexibility by also creating a black-and-gray version of one of the four to complete the series.","Printmaking (0.95257), Printing (0.789346), Etching (0.616922), Linocut (0.559167), Sculpture (0.490238), Woodcut (0.430978), Aquatint (0.415079), Engraving (0.403544)"

Its abstracted form recalls the artist's better-known sculptural works in wire or latticed wood strips, and the evocative shape echoes their frequent bird- or molelike references. A related detail etched delicately in red at the upper left transforms this otherwise iconic presentation of the main figure into something like a freehand sketch, reinforcing a sense of spontaneity. With its clean lines and organic shape suggesting both a natural form and a useful object, such as a vessel or musical instrument, this print reflects the wide range of influences that inform Puryear's overall oeuvre. These include a lifelong aptitude for carpentry, an affinity for various craft traditions, and an early fascination with subjects as diverse as ornithology, archery, and Native American history. As a young man Puryear spent two years working for the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone, where he developed a profound respect for the wood-carvers of that region. He later enrolled in the printmaking program at Sweden's Royal Academy of Art, and while there found himself drawn to Scandinavian wood carving. Upon his return to the United States, in the late 1960s, he studied fine art at Yale University, absorbing the current developments in Minimalism, earthworks, and site-specific sculpture. Blending modernist abstraction with a commitment to handcraftsmanship, Puryear's work is remarkable for the sheer beauty that comes from its exacting manipulation of materials and techniques.","Printmaking (0.950311), Sculpture (0.900885), Woodcut (0.883175), Visual arts (0.704358), Art (0.662622), Etching (0.6576), Sierra Leone (0.652131), Native Americans in the United States (0.599604)"

A visual reminder of an unresolved conflict in history that began with Belgian colonial rule and proceeded to Congolese independence and ongoing civil war, the painting was inspired by a debate, belatedly begun in Belgium in 2000, about the events surrounding Lumumba's assassination thirty-nine years earlier. But this stark portrait tells us nothing about Lumumba or Africa. By implication, the portrait leads our attention to Belgium's unspoken historical role in colonialism, and to the country's conflicted consciousness as it confronts this disputatious past. If, as Tuymans has said, the subject of this work is history, then the object is a vessel of historical memory. Working from his own visual memory of Lumumba's photograph rather than from the photograph itself, the artist re-created his subject through subtle changes. Lightening the shade of Lumumba's skin and altering the look in his eyes, Tuymans challenges the stereotype of the black man as ""savage,"" a source of threat and apprehension. Is Lumumba, seen in lighter tones, a more ""civilized"" man? Tuymans seems to be asking us. Here, Lumumba's bemused gaze seems to question the very myth that he has become. Tuymans's selection of this particular image recalls a mid-nineteenth-century European tradition in which vast archives of documentary photographs were built up as part of the control and surveillance of the colonized populations. Power, secrecy, and control laws stand at the origin of those archives. It is this ideological connotation of photography that Tuymans subverts by addressing it so forthrightly. The artist goes beyond photography's indexical representation, critiquing and twisting its original function in order to intertwine the representational contents of history, myth, and memory. Tuymans inspires the viewer to ponder the creation of cultural identity through political history. Through Lumumba's gaze we see the artist gazing at history.","Democratic Republic of the Congo (0.974143), Belgian Congo (0.916463), Patrice Lumumba (0.898211), Colonialism (0.841817), Congo Crisis (0.83196), Prime minister (0.687499), Belgium (0.638951), Mouvement National Congolais (0.635641)"

Johnson was among the foremost painters of African-American life during the Harlem Renaissance. Born in South Carolina and educated in fine arts in New York and Provincetown, Johnson spent most of his time from the mid-1920s to the late 1930s in Europe, where he was influenced by Post-Impressionism and Expressionism. After achieving critical acclaim abroad, he returned to New York permanently in 1938 under the threat of war and with a desire to reconnect to his roots. The move produced a dramatic change in his work. Assigned by the government's Works Progress Administration to teach at the Harlem Community Art Center, Johnson became immersed in the sights, sounds, and people of New York's African-American community, which he captured in compositions of flat shapes, patterned designs, and brilliant colors that were distinctly modernist in their simplicity and directness. During his lifetime, Johnson created more than seventy-five prints. While in Europe he produced woodcuts and linoleum cuts, usually with hand coloring, inspired by the raw power of German Expressionism. After returning to New York, he took up screenprint and pochoir, techniques that suited his new embrace of simplified forms and bold colors. He printed these works on assorted found papers and often completed his images by hand with tempera, making each print slightly different from the next. He frequently experimented with subjects by printing compositional variants and also rendering them in drawing and painting, each format enriching the other, but with the printed versions the most simplified of all. Notable among Johnson's New York prints are those that capture the essence of Harlem's fashion, music, and dance. This print, entitled Blind Singer, shows a pair of musicians in an open-air performance that was common on the city's bustling streets. The composition's flatness, pure color, and orchestrated angularity endow this still image with a sense of rhythmic motion and dynamic energy.","New York City (0.949342), Harlem (0.865525), Harlem Renaissance (0.756934), Printing (0.753808), Printmaking (0.700491), Painting (0.649118), James Weldon Johnson (0.564896), Color (0.563686)"

In 1955 she enrolled in a local art school, making occasional trips to New York to see the work of the Abstract Expressionists. Accepted at a prestigious summer program at Yale University, Celmins befriended other young artists, including Chuck Close and Brice Marden, and fully devoted herself to the study of art. After abandoning her early painterly style, Celmins began making images based on her growing collection of newspaper clippings and photographs, sometimes combining or juxtaposing them in a single work. She eventually developed a group of recurring themes that included infinitely vast natural spaces such as ocean and lunar surfaces, deserts, and starry-night skies that can be related to both the allover compositions of Abstract Expressionism and the implied flatness of Minimalist abstraction. She returns frequently to these motifs, reworking them over long periods of time and in a variety of mediums, with the resulting images marked by enigmatic, contemplative effects. An interest in mark-making and the gradual and meticulous buildup of an image dominate Celmins's work. This concern is evident in paintings made via many rounds of painting and sanding, drawings made of innumerable pencil marks, as well as in her prints, which she began creating in earnest at the invitation of Tamarind Lithography Workshop in 1970. Gravitating toward labor-intensive mediums such as mezzotint or approaching techniques such as woodcut with a rarely found intricacy, as seen here, Celmins exploits the physicality of the printmaking process to suit her vision.

When she moved to the United States in 1993 to attend the Rhode Island School of Design, ultimately settling in New York, Sikander began integrating personal and contemporary symbols outside customary miniature painting, while also giving this centuries-old tradition renewed relevance. Varying greatly in scale and medium, Sikander's recent work emphasizes its physical, often labor-intensive formats, from jewel-like paintings and narrative scrolls to wall-size installations and digital montages. Her work continually challenges convention in both formal structure and content, crossing artistic and cultural boundaries—Hindu and Muslim, East and West, past and present, handicraft and digitization. With a strong academic background in printmaking, Sikander created her first published print in 1999 with Deitch/Steinberg Editions in New York. Initially making a screenprint, she has since experimented with etching, photogravure, drypoint, and chine collé, often using a computer to reprocess and layer her imagery digitally. Working with a variety of workshops—Noblet Serigraphie, Burnet Editions, Crown Point Press, and Axelle Editions among them—she has completed twenty-five prints to date, including two portfolios. For Afloat, Sikander returned to screenprinting, creating a bold, ethereal work inspired by her installations of painted murals layered with translucent drawings.

He started as an artist by designing album covers for his brother's punk rock band Black Flag in the late 1970s. In 1978 he began making photocopied compilations of his drawings as books, with more than one hundred titles issued to date. An underground figure for many years before he received art-world attention in the early 1990s, Pettibon originally sold these books in comic-book and record stores in his hometown of Los Angeles. Pettibon's style developed initially from cartoons, although he has also named Francisco Goya and William Blake as influences. His imagery refers to various American cultural archetypes such as surfers, G.I.s in Vietnam, and baseball players, as well as specific figures such as Charles Manson, John F. Kennedy, and Batman. Pettibon's texts are often fragments from his favorite authors, including Henry James, Marcel Proust, and William Faulkner, among many others, taken out of context and sometimes altered. Unconnected in any straightforward way, the texts resonate with the images to suggest complex, ambiguous, and often amusing readings and a sensibility that moves from the lyrical to the sardonic. Pettibon's voice rises from the dark side of American culture, reflecting sources in detective fiction, the tabloid press, and film noir. Lithography has become a natural extension of Pettibon's drawing practice.

Both his teacher, Robert Henri, and his supervisor at the Socialist journal The New Masses, artist John Sloan, taught him to record everyday life in a realist mode. Following the Armory Show, however, Davis began to experiment with reconciling abstraction and representation. Davis's entire printed oeuvre consists of twenty-seven works, mostly lithographs, created between 1915 and 1964. While in Paris in the late 1920s, he made his first prints, most likely at the renowned lithography workshop of Edmond Desjobert, where other American artists gathered. When Davis returned to the United States in 1931, he began work on five lithographs. They represent his mature style and his most accomplished efforts in printmaking. Exploiting lithography's potential for rich blacks and contrasting grays against a background of white paper, Davis suggests a sense of visual syncopation in his overall compositional structure. This creative manipulation of the medium was probably achieved with the guidance of the distinguished American printer, George C. Miller. Davis's ability to express the dynamic atmosphere of the American scene is evident in all three prints. Planar and curvilinear abstract forms are combined with references to commercial culture. Barber Shop Chord and Theatre on the Beach, both amalgams of the imaginary and the real, include motifs from Davis's seaside retreat in Gloucester, Massachusetts, but the latter also incorporates the facade of a Parisian theater and a figure suggesting a cellist. Sixth Avenue El refers primarily to New York City. These lithographs were exhibited at the Downtown Gallery, one of the primary venues of the day for contemporary American art, and received critical acclaim.Originally from TextEntryID 69583 (TextTypeID 127)he began work on five lithographs, three of which are illustrated here","Armory Show (0.963246), Robert Henri (0.910768), John French Sloan (0.821585), New York City (0.696586), Printmaking (0.642254), Printing (0.608662), American modernism (0.606016), United States (0.545189)"

The formal character of the Torus House design is remarkable for its melding of seemingly incompatible geometric languages. The architect hopes to reinvigorate the historical tension between the orthodox and the radical: ""The dialectic between norm and exception in architecture relies on the persistence or memory of social and building conventions on the one hand and formal transgression on the other."" In this instance, the norm is a courtyard house, which is transformed by the use of nonarchitectural, seamless, curvilinear forms derived from the torus. That topological form is generated by rotating one circle along the path of a second, larger circle, usually producing a doughnutlike shape. Amplifying the ambiguity between the house's interior and exterior, a stair, which occupies what would be the hollow core of the torus, bypasses the interior of the house by running directly from the parking area at ground level to the roof above.

He first studied printmaking as a student and had an early job at a screenprint shop, giving him the opportunity to work in that technique. Later, at the invitation of publisher Robert Feldman of Parasol Press, he began to make etchings. He was inspired by his initial collaboration with printer Kathan Brown at Crown Point Press and has worked extensively in this medium, exploring its potential for subtle mark-making and surface richness and relishing the physical engagement it requires. To date, Marden has completed more than one hundred fifty prints, most of which appear in some sixty portfolios and series. Dedicated to Marden's goddaughter, the portfolio 12 Views for Caroline Tatyana reflects a fascination with ancient Greek architecture that was sparked after Marden began spending summers on the island of Hydra. Here he captures the effects of sunlight and shadow on colonnades, and also explores serial formats and systems as he combines plates to create permutations and mirror images throughout the portfolio. During the late 1980s Marden became interested in calligraphy, evident in Zen Study 3 (Early State) and Zen Study 6 (Early State). Based on poems of a celebrated Chinese poet named ""Cold Mountain,"" it is made up of tangled webs and vertical gestures suggesting poetic couplets. The etching process for this print—sugarlift—allows for flowing gesture, which Marden created by dipping a stick in a sugar solution and drawing with it on a prepared etching plate.","Minimalism (0.989069), Printmaking (0.963119), Brice Marden (0.827768), Abstract art (0.752397), Etching (0.673382), Abstract expressionism (0.607651), Greece (0.590567), History of painting (0.570968)"

With curvilinear lines and biomorphic shapes, he sought to meld the realm of the unconscious to essential life forms, veering toward abstraction but always maintaining links to humanity, nature, and the cosmos. Miró's relationship to printmaking was tentative at first, with benefit prints such as Daphnis and Chloé for the periodical Minotaure, and Woman and Dog in Front of the Moon for an association of artists in Barcelona. It was when he was introduced to the painter Louis Marcoussis, who maintained a printshop in his studio, that he took up printmaking in earnest, and his natural inclinations toward new tools and materials blossomed. His methodical working process also suited these efforts, and prints of the Black and Red Series, created there, demonstrate his systematic use of more than one copperplate and his experiments with color inking. In the example here a symbolic family group responds in terror to a monstrous head, referring to Miró's anguish over the Spanish Civil War and the fear provoked by Generalissimo Francisco Franco at that time. Miró continued his exploration of intaglio techniques at Stanley William Hayter's Atelier 17 workshop in New York in the 1940s, when he was there on an extended visit.

That exhibition launched the careers of several figures who became known as the Young British Artists (YBAs). Hume's first major paintings, influenced by Minimalism and Conceptual art, were based on hospital swing doors. He abandoned this series in 1992 and turned to an unabashedly sensual, biomorphic style in vivid colors recalling Pop art. His silhouetted forms are based on images of women, plants, and animals found in advertising and fashion as well as in art history. They are selected, he says, ""for their ability to describe beauty and pathos."" In printmaking Hume has worked exclusively in screenprint, which corresponds perfectly to the uniformly flat, mechanical-looking surfaces of his glossy enamel-on-aluminum paintings. Since 1996 he has produced two major series published by The Paragon Press, as well as several individual prints issued by Paragon and other publishers. Like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, who are among his most obvious predecessors, Hume uses printmaking as a way of revisiting the imagery in his paintings, refracting their forms and ideas through another set of materials and in a different scale. His Spring Angels series is related to several paintings titled Angel, some of which were completed prior to the prints and some afterwards. The imagery is based on the artist's photographs of enormous concrete angels on the ceiling of the Catholic Cathedral in Brasilia. Following his usual practice, he enlarged and simplified certain details of the photographs in order to generate the outlines that structure his quasi-abstract compositions. The springtime color scheme, which is based on leaves and cuttings the artist brought from the countryside into the print workshop, represents a subtle departure from Hume's previously more acidic palette.","Damien Hirst (0.969326), Young British Artists (0.9622), Andy Warhol (0.806284), Roy Lichtenstein (0.783811), Pop art (0.759013), Freeze (0.681454), Conceptual art (0.589994), University of London (0.567654)"

Beuys entered into a battle with the school over its policy of limited admission, which he felt was undemocratic, and he intentionally over–enrolled his classes in protest. Mounting complaints against his many artistic provocations from other members of the faculty eventually led to his dismissal, in 1972, when he was finally escorted out of the building after staging a sit-in with his students.

He wanted to extend the creative process into every facet of life and employ art as an educational tool. Using tactics reminiscent of Dada decades earlier, and inspired by the progressive, interdisciplinary ideas of the Fluxus group in the early 1960s, Beuys felt art should be a way of life, not a profession. This philosophy culminated in his actions, or social sculptures, that were ritualistic theatrical events in which he assumed the role of modern-day shaman to arouse a spiritual response in other people and affect change in the world around him. Beuys is famous for saying, ""If you have all my multiples then you have me entirely."" As a political activist and a passionate professor, as well as a visual artist, he was strongly committed to the dissemination of his ideas to a mass audience and, beginning in 1965, completed more than six hundred prints and multiples. He referred to them as his ""vehicles"" and believed he could imbue them with a psychic energy as they went out into the world, reflecting the theme of transubstantiation that underlies much of his work. His editions range from contemplative sculptural objects in relatively small editions to mass-produced printed ephemera such as political flyers, shopping bags, and postcards, many of which function as relics of his short-lived actions. In this life-size print We Are the Revolution, Beuys emphatically calls for communal action to transform society, encapsulating a period of fervent political activism in the early 1970s. Earth Telephone reflects his fundamental theme of energy flow, or Hauptstrom (main stream). Here the telephone represents a transmitter of electric current that passes energy through the earth, while his signature felt material symbolizes the conservation of this warmth.","Activism (0.983392), Fluxus (0.897426), Activism industry (0.67747), Politics (0.667302), Aesthetics (0.615806)"

On closer inspection, however, it unravels and becomes something else entirely. The flat tones, sharp contours, and regular shading suggest that the artist's source for the drawing was a photograph of a cup rather than a cup itself. Indeed, no simple sketch taken from life, 4.6.1999 is an image of an image. Most likely derived from one of Richter's own snapshots, the drawing bears the pictorial imprint of the impersonal and mechanical language of the camera. The erased marks that run across the center of the sheet further complicate the drawing. Slicing the motif into strips, these striations disrupt the ""transparency"" of the image, calling special attention to the process of the drawing's making. Like the use of photographic source material, these erasures register the artist's hand negatively, as something absent or canceled.The tension between the apparent simplicity of the motif and the pregnant implications of the means by which it was rendered points to the critical charge in Richter's art, which over the last four decades has probed the myriad ways in which images are made and perceived. Working in many different mediums and styles (indeed, this drawing was executed concurrently with another work done completely abstractly), Richter has consistently examined the contingency of representation, fashioning a body of work of tremendous variety, versatility, and import. By underscoring the constructed nature of illusionism, Richter's work invites viewers to reflect on how they perceive the world, and, in the process, invests his personal visions with public implications.","Photography (0.959045), Image (0.801827), Sketch (0.795208), Painting (0.734194), Drawing (0.721584), Computer graphics (0.713132), IMAGE (0.649265), Photograph (0.571413)"

This style was in direct contrast to traditional art, with its emphasis on individual expression. Rodchenko and like-minded artists worked in a wide variety of mediums, including textiles, ceramics, posters, furniture, architecture, and exhibition design. Rodchenko's focus was on graphic design, photography, and photomontage—a filmic medium that combines and juxtaposes photographic fragments. His designs for books ranged from collaborations with poet friends to propaganda magazines intended for mass distribution. Among his most fruitful collaborations was that with poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, who also embraced Rodchenko's goal of reaching out to the Soviet proletariat rather than to the artistic elite. Together they produced government advertising posters, books, and several journals. One such joint project, About This: To Her and to Me, featured the first photomontages by Rodchenko to be used in book design. The illustrations provide a lively counterpoint to the long love poem Mayakovsky wrote for his lover and muse Lily Brik, whose portrait is on the cover. Rodchenko's work in book design had begun with handmade carbon-copied books in the late teens that continued an earlier Futurist aesthetic and were made in very small editions. By contrast, his later Constructivist book covers were issued by the state publishing house in much larger numbers. One of the latter is the wraparound cover for Orator: Verse, which exemplifies the architectural, rationalized, compositional structure of the post-Revolution design aesthetic.","Constructivism (0.967161), Lilya Brik (0.91472), Graphic design (0.888914), Russian avant-garde (0.832228), Alexander Rodchenko (0.807336), Osip Brik (0.747717), Design (0.716353), Vladimir Mayakovsky (0.707132)"

He made significant contributions to the Jewish cultural renaissance in Russia, illustrating children's books, designing journals, and co-founding a Yiddish publishing house. He also traveled frequently to Germany, settling there for periods, and becoming well known for his masterful graphic design. His work included paintings, photographs, photomontages, designs for exhibitions, architecture, and books, and also prints, primarily lithographs. At the behest of Marc Chagall, Lissitzky accepted the directorship of the graphic workshop at the Vitebsk Art Institute in 1919. Following Kazimir Malevich's arrival at the school, Lissitzky became greatly influenced by Suprematism and began to work in an abstract style. He invented imagery known as Proun (Project for the Affirmation of the New), which consisted of images of floating architectonic structures that occupied an imagined three-dimensional space through which one might move above, below, and through. The Proun style can be seen in New Man, the name of a character in the groundbreaking 1913 Russian Futurist opera Victory over the Sun. After seeing a 1920 production staged in Vitebsk, Lissitzky adapted the opera for a cast of mechanical puppets. His designs incorporate the geometry and limited color palette of Suprematism and the multidimensionality of the Proun images. Lissitzky's innovations in graphic and book design are strikingly visible in his landmark project For the Voice, a collection of thirteen of the best-known poems by Russian Futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. The poems were intended to be read aloud, and Lissitzky designed a thumb index with titles to help the reader quickly locate a desired verse. He also designed title pages for each of the poems, constructing images by combining typefaces of various sizes printed in red and black.","El Lissitzky (0.945044), Russian avant-garde (0.934561), Russia (0.833081), Graphic design (0.765885), Kazimir Malevich (0.649994), Design (0.588048), Marc Chagall (0.586887)"

In fact, she was often referred to as one of the ""amazons"" of the group. Deeply involved in the artistic community in Saint Petersburg, Rozanova was an active public speaker, a contributor to numerous exhibitions, and a participant in a variety of state-sponsored artistic teaching programs before her untimely death from diphtheria in 1918. One of the hallmarks of the Russian avant-garde was a particularly close and fertile collaboration between poets and painters, which led to pioneering experiments in the medium of the illustrated book. Rozanova contributed to more than fifteen such projects during her short career. Her interest was in creating an overall design rather than in simply making accompanying illustrations. In this respect she rejected traditional book production. Collaborations with her companion, Russian Futurist poet Aleksei Kruchenykh, including A Little Duck's Nest . . . of Bad Words, demonstrate her success at achieving a new unity and syncopation of text and imagery. Rozanova considered the portfolio War to be her crowning achievement in printmaking, especially since she printed the linoleum cuts herself. She included colors and incorporated collage elements in some of her designs. Her imagery is influenced both by the abstracted forms of Cubism and Futurism, as well as by traditional Russian motifs such as those found in the lubok (popular, centuries-old illustrated Russian broadsides). Short verses by Kruchenykh provided some text, but Rozanova also added actual items from newspapers reporting on the war, which she integrated into her compositions, as in Excerpt from a Newspaper Bulletin.","Olga Rozanova (0.979507), Russian avant-garde (0.975315), Painting (0.854394), Velimir Khlebnikov (0.698069), Aleksei Kruchenykh (0.641858), Zaum (0.609908), Cubism (0.600747), Cubo-Futurism (0.570028)"

She organized exhibitions of contemporary Russian painting, engaged in public debates, and wrote manifestos about modern art. In addition to painting, she contributed to nearly twenty early Futurist books and designed sets for more than thirty plays and ballets, many of which took her to Paris, where she settled in 1919. Although aware of European movements such as Cubism and Futurism, Goncharova sought to create an art that reflected Russia's history and artistic traditions. With her husband and life-long artistic collaborator Mikhail Larionov, Goncharova first worked in a style called Neo-Primitivism, which was marked by crude forms, an absence of perspective, and distorted proportions. For inspiration she looked to her native Russian art forms such as the lubok (inexpensive, popular prints), icons, and folk and children's art. These influences are visible in her bold designs for A Game in Hell, a narrative poem written in a consciously naive style that describes a card game between devils and sinners in Hell. After developing an abstract painting style with Larionov called Rayism, Goncharova became increasingly involved in theater and ballet design. Although her career in this field was flourishing in Paris, she returned to Moscow in 1914 following the outbreak of war in Russia. There she was inspired to create Mystical Images of War, a portfolio that follows a long tradition of print cycles on this theme. Here she drew on motifs from Russian religion, mythology, and folklore and combined them with realistic renderings of, for example, military uniforms of the day. The result is a timeless portrait of war, past and present.","Modernism (0.977712), Russia (0.90892), History of painting (0.896718), Russian avant-garde (0.856483), Modern art (0.757471), Neo-primitivism (0.749378), Cubism (0.748747), Rayonism (0.721521)"

Although Vinciarelli trained as an architect, her imaginary universe respects no program, function, or client. We view spaces that do not exist, except on paper, where an invisible light source creates the illusion of placid reflections on a changing volume of water contained in a vessel or anonymous architectural structure. In Vinciarelli's virtuoso handling, the transparent, glowing quality of the watercolor medium conveys transcendent feelings. Void of extraneous details such as ordinary things, human presence, and recognizable architectural elements and signs, the compositions assume metaphysical qualities. The lateral symmetry in each work provides a sense of calm balance and control (Vinciarelli suggests it provides a ""system of rules"") that serves as a connective thread between each drawing in the series. This seriality suggests narrative, and the drawings are numbered one through seven, but the sequence is somewhat random; Vinciarelli has likened it to the notes of a musical scale, but just as the notes in a scale are played in different orders to create musical passages, the drawings too can be viewed in varying sequences. In whatever order they appear, the changing tonal variations from one drawing to the next—the shifting qualities of light and shadow in the spaces, on the surfaces, and on the changing volumes of water, with their mesmerizing reflections—will stimulate feelings and imply a fluid narrative. The warm orange and ocher tones of Orange Sound recall remembered landscapes, perhaps particularly the American Southwest, where Vinciarelli spent time with the artist Donald Judd. She clearly admires Judd's serial Minimalist sculpture, and art in a similar vein. Throughout her work, which exists primarily on paper, Vinciarelli has pushed the traditional boundaries between art and architecture by exploring the relationship between the two disciplines. Her abiding interest in formal typologies, and her investigations of the essentially immeasurable qualities of light, space, and reflection, suggest both a realm of the sublime and a place where meaningful architecture can begin.","Minimalism (0.930225), Donald Judd (0.91352), Sculpture (0.858542), Music (0.838817), Architecture (0.779362), Chinati Foundation (0.65548), Space (0.598655), Sequence (0.572937)"

Their sculptures, installations, and works on paper are deliberately aimed at confronting middle-class values and notions of good taste. Among their controversial early works are fiberglass sculptures of figures whose facial features have been replaced by genitalia.Despite their sardonic nihilism and bad-boy reputations, the Chapmans' work is often grounded in art history, including repeated references to Francisco de Goya and other proponents of satire and fantasy. These etchings, for example, are from a portfolio inspired by the Surrealist game of chance known as Exquisite Corpse, in which a sheet of paper is folded into four parts corresponding to the head, chest, trunk, and legs of a human body. Each player draws one section and then conceals it before passing it on to the next. In that manner the two brothers took turns drawing on prepared etching plates to make this portfolio. Combining horror with humor and clearly relishing the minute, obsessive details that are possible in etching, the Chapmans concocted the hallucinatory figures in this series by connecting various bizarre, incongruous, and often sexualized or scatological forms.","Printmaking (0.986348), Pablo Picasso (0.820783), Young British Artists (0.788291), Exquisite corpse (0.784175), Aquatint (0.700312), Aesthetics (0.62738), Francisco Goya (0.612995), The Disasters of War (0.59443)"

Although identified by name, these subjects reveal none of the nuances of individual personality found in traditional portraiture. Instead, Close focuses on his working procedures—the ""means"" rather than the ""ends"" usually associated with this genre. It is the visual effects of translating a photograph into a painting that Close exploits in endless permutations. Translating still further into printmaking offers even more variables to stimulate his creativity. He has completed approximately fifty-five prints, working in numerous techniques. These editions have allowed a broad audience to have access to his work, a fact that Close appreciates since his painting process is lengthy and results in relatively few canvases. Close's active engagement in printmaking began with his first print, Keith/Mezzotint, created in 1972. This project came about at the instigation of publisher Robert Feldman of Parasol Press, who arranged for Close to work with master printer Kathan Brown at Crown Point Press. So as not to be intimidated by the printer's expertise, Close rather perversely selected mezzotint, a long-out-of-favor and laborious technique that would be as much of a challenge for Brown as for him. When his constant trial proofing wore down the markings on the plate around the mouth, Close decided he liked that exposure of his process and went even further by allowing his grided guide to show through. From that time on, a grid has often been visible in his work in all mediums. Such fruitful collaborations with printers, and the impetus of invigorating new techniques, have repeatedly fed back into Close's work as a whole and made printmaking essential to his overall artistic practice.","Printmaking (0.977899), Printing (0.823499), Portrait painting (0.628335), Creativity techniques (0.554594), Edition (0.525024), Artist's proof (0.501616), Portrait (0.476802), Mezzotint (0.469708)"

Early on he displayed a facility for drawing, a voracious appetite for learning about subjects as diverse as ornithology, archery, and Native American history, and a particular aptitude for building useful objects. During a two-year stint in the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone, he developed an interest in and respect for the wood carvers of that region. Upon his return, he was accepted at Sweden's Royal Academy of Art as a printmaking student. There Puryear found himself deeply drawn to Scandinavian wood carving and began spending his evenings in the sculpture studio while also accepting unofficial apprenticeships with local craftspeople. When he returned to the United States, he enrolled in the art program at Yale, absorbing the current developments in Minimalism, post-Minimalism, earthworks, and site-specific sculpture. Puryear's work, consisting primarily of sculpture in wire mesh, tar, bronze, leather, and his preferred medium of wood, reflects these diverse influences and experiences. Abstractions that resemble organic and biomorphic shapes suggest a usefulness or functionality and often reveal a labor-intensive handcraftsmanship and an interest in culture and identity. Since the 1980s, he has resumed printmaking at various workshops, gravitating toward direct, physical mediums such as etching and woodcut. Puryear has made approximately twenty-five prints, many of which echo the forms of his sculptures, including this Untitled work. The woodcuts for Cane, a poetic novel of the Harlem Renaissance, combine organic forms and figurative presences and are named for the female characters in the story.","Woodcut (0.965363), Wood carving (0.783124), Sculpture (0.764877), United States (0.710366), Printmaking (0.700267), Wood (0.545014), Old master print (0.529907), Harlem Renaissance (0.526734)"

Cedric Price explored a type of architecture that, like medicine, would operate less as a remedy for the ills of society and more as a preventive system, creating flexible conditions previously thought impossible within a socially beneficial environment. This complicated project, for which many drawings and diagrams were made, was essentially a system of cubelike elements that could be moved and combined with others or with additional elements to create temporary structures for a rehearsal or performance space, housing, or just contemplation within a lush natural setting. It was intended to operate by means of a central computer with which a visitor would combine any of 150 of the Generator's four-by-four meter, fully serviced, air-conditioned cubes, or walls, screens, gangways, and communications channels into a structure. The computer would encourage the visitor to continually refine and improve his or her design.

Employing conventions of perspective developed in the fifteenth century, Rossi uses an aerial view to give a sense of the cemetery in both plan and elevation. One enters this wall-enclosed space through a gate opposite what seems to be an abandoned house, a cubic structure designed as a collective or nondenominational temple to be used for funeral, religious, or civil ceremonies. As one proceeds along the central axis, it passes through successive rectangular structures, riblike ossuaries that rise in height as they diminish in length. The journey is punctuated by a cone-shaped smokestack monumentalizing a communal grave for the unknown, and referencing the industrial landscape beyond. Rossi's design is rooted in an Enlightenment typology of the cemetery as a walled structure set on the outskirts of town. It not only recalls the adjacent Costa Cemetery but, as Rossi says, ""complies with the image of a cemetery that everyone has."" A structure without a roof, it is a deserted building intended for those who no longer need the protection of shelter-a house for the dead in which life and death exist as a continuum within the collective memory. Through his use of aerial perspective, elemental form, and color, Rossi constructs a visual passage through the drawing that corresponds to the journey contra natura through the cemetery. Shadows stem from a particular light source yet reference no particular time of day. Perspective, traditionally universalizing, is colored with a Northern Italian palette, and draws our eye not back into space but rather up the page.

Later, in the 1990s, Ligon appropriated literary texts by black authors such as Ralph Ellison and James Baldwin. In this work he refers to a comment made in the New York Times about Martin Puryear, another contemporary African American artist: ""There is a consciousness we all have that he is a black American artist but I think his work is really superior and stands on its own.""By stenciling this sentence in capital letters across two adjacent sheets of paper, Ligon purposefully and effectively creates disruptive breaks in the text, further disconnecting the sentence from any concrete reference to Puryear's work and forcefully pointing out the misguided practice of using race as a factor in judging the quality of a work of art. Furthermore, painted in light ochre, the words are not easily legible against the background, and only through a concerted effort can the text be read.

Preserved behind plexiglass are a stylized séance table, a stack of barbells cast in solar salt, and a veiled top hat filled to the brim with honeycombed beeswax. A vaguely anthropomorphic recumbent shape made of cast solar salt fixed with epoxy resin seems part body fragment, part crystalline landscape, and appears suspended in a liminal state between becoming and unbecoming. All, with the exception of the barbells, are attributes of Baby Fay La Foe, a real-life clairvoyant as well as a character in Barney's gothic Western Cremaster 2 (1999), the fourth film in the artist's epic, five-part Cremaster cycle.Barney's overarching concerns are with the mutability, metamorphosis, and creation of form. Best-known for his feature-length films, he describes himself as a sculptor, insisting that all of his polyglot production—films, photographs, drawings, sculptures, banners, and installations—exists as a series of discrete yet interrelated objects within the multidimensional space of the Cremaster cycle's self-enclosed universe. The Cabinet of Baby Fay La Foe recapitulates on a microcosmic level key features of Barney's expansive cosmology. Drawing on Surrealist strategies of fragmentation, uncanny juxtaposition, and fetishistic display, the luminous nylon borders of the cabinet's vitrine are a material manifestation of film's (and photography's) omnipresent invisible frame. Filled with fantasy objects constructed from the artist's signature materials, the work is nominally a symbolic portrait, yet any fixed meanings remain sealed off, subject to transformation and thus tantalizingly out of reach.","The Cremaster Cycle (0.988992), Matthew Barney (0.820926)"

While a prize-winning commercial artist in the 1950s, he devised a printing process of blotting outline drawings in ink from one surface to another. In a whimsical book of fashionable shoe styles, done at the time he was head of advertising at a shoe company, his blotted drawings were reproduced and then hand-colored by a team of friends.Although Warhol adopted a bland, detached persona, he was an extremely energetic artist and self-promoter who played a significant role in redirecting the course of art. Rather than deriving his work from subjective personal feelings or idealist visions for abstraction, Warhol embraced popular culture and commercial processes. He eventually set up his own print-publishing company called Factory Additions, issuing portfolios of his signature themes. For Marilyn, he created ten highly variable portraits, exploiting the possibilities in screenprinting for shifting colors and off-register effects. By celebrating the seemingly impervious veneer of glamour and fame, but acknowledging its darker inner complexity, these prints reveal Warhol's subtle grasp of American culture. Warhol did not participate in the collaborative printshop system established in America in the 1960s, but his work contributed decisively to what has been characterized as a ""print boom"" at that time. Through the course of his career, he made nearly eight hundred printed images on paper, about half published in traditional editions. He was also a surprisingly experimental printmaker, issuing hundreds of trial proofs and unique variants.

Mendelsohn's architectural ideas were shaped in the chaotic climate of Germany in the period around World War I, and most dramatically by his close association with leaders of the Expressionist movement. Even his signature style of rendering was developed during his army service in the war: tracing paper was scarce, so he began to use thumbnail sketches to portray the large complexes of his design imagination. This early sketch for Jerusalem's Hadassah University Hospital was made in 1935, the same year Mendelsohn emigrated to Palestine. He was still working out the design, which would go through many more variations.

As this drawing shows, he was equally concerned with impressive views of the buildings from vantage points below. His consistent choice of exterior perspectives as his primary tools for describing a building, rather than the plans and elevations preferred by most modernist architects, reinforced his vision of the project as an entirety: ""My sketches are data, the contour lines of an instantaneous vision.

The answer came two years later with Pulp Fiction, a film that skillfully shifted attention away from its own considerable violence with unexpected humor, both verbal and visual, and that kept viewers off–kilter with its fragmented narrative structure without in any way thwarting their desire for coherence and resolution. A self–taught student of film history, Tarantino has the uncanny ability to absorb and invoke the work of past filmmakers without plagiarizing them. Pulp Fiction, as its very title suggests, portrays a seedy world, but as its title also suggests, it does so with a knowing wink and refusal to take itself too seriously—a ploy that allows Tarantino to load his film with all manner of baroque narrative twists and turns without boring his audience or making them turn away in revulsion. On the contrary, Pulp Fiction is the kind of film that audiences find impossible to turn away from, so curious are they to see what could possibly come next.

Working from images culled from the mass media and from her own photographs and videos of people she knows, she conveys slightly world-weary emotional content with an expressive visual language of drips, streaks, and broad, painterly brushstrokes rendered in colors so loaded as to suggest a cross between late-nineteenth-century Symbolism and late-1990s fashion advertising. Using translucent oil paints or watercolors, she imbues her waifish subjects with light that seems to radiate from within. Peyton has been making prints since 1998, when Parkett magazine commissioned her to create a lithograph. That print, a portrait of writer and aesthete Oscar Wilde and his companion Lord Alfred Douglas, nicknamed Bosie, is related to the lithograph shown here. Deriving this image from the 1998 movie Wilde, Peyton rejects the cliché of Bosie as a selfish, childish paramour who corrupted his older, more accomplished partner, leading to the latter's downfall. Peyton, like Wilde, interested in beauty, renders Bosie sympathetically in pink and lavender colors symbolic of his elegant androgyny. Her painting style translates easily into the lithographic medium, as she can achieve watery-looking washes and tactile effects with tusche, an oily ink used in this technique. Peyton's other activities in printmaking include a series of lithographs commissioned jointly by the Public Art Fund and a real-estate developer for display in two Manhattan hotels. She has also turned to etching, depicting mostly her circle of friends in delicate linear studies. Most recently she has embarked on a monotype project and made her first woodcut and an aquatint at Two Palms Press, bringing her sitters right into the printshop.","Printmaking (0.960331), Oscar Wilde (0.692104), Lord Alfred Douglas (0.626555), Lithography (0.48429), Sid Vicious (0.477367), Intaglio (0.468822), Symbolism (0.463401), The Importance of Being Earnest (0.426817)"

The combination of decorative style and social content is part of a deceptively playful exploration of issues related to black identity. The four series of etchings Ofili has made to date reveal the sensitive, lyrical core of his art. Each series consists of ten prints inspired by a particular trip. On each trip, Ofili took along a set of copper etching plates and, working methodically, used a different abstract pattern obliquely related to his impressions of the specific place. Calling his project ""an odd kind of tourism,"" he used cross-hatching for the first series, Barcelona, in 1992, followed by small dots for Berlin, concentric waves for New York, and diamond patterns for the North Wales prints. The specific sites he visited there are noted at the bottom left of each plate. Describing his work on these plates as ""nourishing,"" Ofili has said: ""It can take me to places within myself that are unfamiliar."" While his obsessively drawn, allover patterns are clearly analogous to the decorative fields in his paintings, the small format and spare, repetitive black markings suggest a process that is more private and introspective.","Chris Ofili (0.931413), African American (0.75406), Magazine (0.651035), Etching (0.640323), Stereotype (0.625005), Engraving (0.605328)"

He made some fifteen hundred prints over the course of his lifetime, fifty-seven of which were created during the 1930s, the key decade for his artistic development and the period when Surrealism gained widespread recognition. Most of Dali's prints from this era appeared as illustrations and frontispieces in books by André Breton, Paul Eluard, and Tristan Tzara, among others, reflecting the artist's close association with the movement's literary figures. In 1930 Dali was invited to illustrate Les Chants de Maldoror, an 1869 text rediscovered by the Surrealists in the 1930s that told a nightmarish tale of an unrepentantly evil protagonist. The book was filled with scenes of violence, perversion, and blasphemy. Dali, who worked in a method he called ""paranoiac-critical,"" used a stream-of-consciousness process to access hallucinations and delusions. These personal visions, rather than scenes described in the prose poem, became the subjects of his illustrations. The individual prints Dali executed in the 1930s, made predominately at the workshop of Roger Lacourière, were experiments in intaglio and were never published as editions. Limp Cranes and ""Cranian"" Harp, composed as an accumulation of sketches, juxtaposes an array of Dali's quintessential motifs—soft watches, mutating shoes, and the stretched harp and deformed skulls referred to in the title. The harp and skull were, for Dali, evocative of melancholy and death. He claimed that his particular obsession with skull imagery was rooted in a childhood memory of encountering an encephalitic whose skull had been deformed by disease.","Salvador Dal (0.989452), Surrealism (0.792897), Andr Breton (0.776907), Paul luard (0.567073), Dada (0.562835), Anti-art (0.475441), Joan Mir (0.464646), Tristan Tzara (0.447388)"

This fact is significant because the drawing's style and the circumstances of its production relate directly to the aging architect's reputation and waning career, which, in 1930, when Wright was in his early sixties, were being challenged by a younger generation associated with the emerging modern movement that would come to be known as the International Style. That year, delivering the Kahn Lectures on Modern Architecture at Princeton University, Wright critiqued aspects of the new architecture. A small exhibition of his work that accompanied the lectures featured many of his projects from the century's first decade—including Unity Temple, an influential building that boldly broke with traditions of ecclesiastical architecture in form, materials, and symbolism. In an effort to recast Wright's work in a more modern guise, his young assistants Heinrich Klumb and Takehiko Okami prepared new drawings for the show in a bold new manner. In this rendering Unity Temple is reduced to starkly contrasting, relatively unornamented black and white planes, and is completely detached from its context in the landscape. The drawing focuses our attention on the cubic massing of the monolithic reinforced-concrete building, the vertical and horizontal planar surfaces, and the corner piers containing the stairs, evident in the plan below. The style is a marked departure from Wright's more typical renderings, which are romantic and colorful, expressively depicting the building, its details, and the surrounding landscape. By effectively co-opting the drawing style of a younger generation of architects associated with the modern movement, Wright consciously positioned himself as a forerunner of the so-called International Style.","Frank Lloyd Wright (0.97996), Modern architecture (0.758173), Bauhaus (0.705022), Unity Temple (0.662626), Louis Sullivan (0.641463), Modernism (0.618846), Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (0.614549), Henry Klumb (0.557189)"

Murray dabbled in printmaking at every step in her early career, from drawing on lithographic stones as a student, to a graduate assistantship, to her first teaching job, which involved establishing a printmaking studio. Although she enjoyed the creative aspects of printmaking, she was frustrated and discouraged by the technical expertise required. She feared that the delicacy of the printing process did not fit with her own creative style: large, boisterous, colorful paintings that seemed ready to jump off the walls, executed on shaped, sometimes three-dimensional, canvases. Thus it took several years and much cajoling to convince her to resume printmaking. In 1979 Murray finally accepted an offer from art dealers Brooke Alexander and Paula Cooper to make prints, and she has now made more than one hundred forty editions in a variety of mediums. Initially inspired by seeing an installation of the various states of Picasso's lithographic series The Bull, Murray began an exploration of her own working process in her first prints. She issued a series of five states of a single lithograph intended to be viewed together as one work.

After two frustrating years at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels, he returned to his hometown of Ostend and set up a studio in the attic of his family's home and souvenir shop. There he continued his education, studying Old Masters such as Breugel and Bosch, copying etchings by Rembrandt and Goya, and making sketches depicting his family's disquieting domestic life. Although Ensor was a member of the Belgian avant-garde group Les Vingt (The Twenty) between 1883 and 1893, he had a pained and tumultuous relationship with his fellow artists and critics. In addition to painting, Ensor made some one hundred forty prints over the course of his career, most of which were etchings completed in an intense burst of activity at the turn of the century. His obsession with death, and his desire to defy it through his art, contributed to his embrace of etching. He wrote, ""I want to survive and I think of solid copperplates, of unalterable inks . . . of faithful printing, and I am adopting etching as a means of expression.""Current political events, literary themes, the life of Christ, and the popular spectacle of the annual carnivals in Belgium were among Ensor's favorite subjects. Deeply concerned with political and social injustice, he ridiculed the Church, the military, and the bourgeoisie. The Entrance of Christ into Brussels updates the story of Christ, giving it contemporary relevance by depicting the masses holding banners, political signs, and advertisements. The Assassination is based on Edgar Allan Poe's gothic tale The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar of 1845, which tells the gruesome story of a hypnotist trying to arrest the process of death by hypnotizing a dying man.","Edgar Allan Poe (0.979484), Belgium (0.642801), James Ensor (0.608675), Ostend (0.484478), Gothic fiction (0.478493), Death (0.452405), Les XX (0.413647), Rembrandt (0.413026)"

Although his work is rooted in abstraction, it is informed by an interest in the structure of biological, architectural, and technological forms. His early work, influenced by natural-history illustrations and medical diagrams, included masses of fertilized and dividing cells and neural connections, while more recent images center around loosely structured grids inspired by microchips, circuitry, and transit maps. Winters believes that painting, drawing, and printmaking play equally important and integral roles in his creative practice, and he often explores themes and ideas across all mediums in his work. Shortly before his first solo exhibition in 1982, he was invited to Universal Limited Art Editions to make his first prints. This initial experiment with lithography developed into a long and fruitful relationship with the workshop and its printers, who have collaborated with Winters on many of his one hundred fifty prints to date. The vast majority of these prints appear in portfolios, a format which is well suited to his interest in systems and structures. His early Folio of 1985, which demonstrates an interest in biological and cellular forms, is constituted to exploit this sequential potential, and his prints up to the present day do so as well. As Winters has grown more involved with printmaking, he has expanded his practice to include intaglio, screenprint, linoleum cut, and woodcut. Additionally, he has experimented with new ways of using traditional print mediums. In Graphic Primitives, which demonstrates his interest in technology and cyberspace, Winters digitally manipulated drawings he had scanned into a computer before having them laser-cut into woodblocks. The blocks were then printed using a process pioneered by Pablo Picasso in which the blocks are printed in white ink before the sheet is rinsed in black ink.","Printmaking (0.985341), Pablo Picasso (0.691418), Printing (0.508013), Drawing (0.353547), Intaglio (0.337062), Lithography (0.323065), Woodcut (0.292542), Linocut (0.286644)"

A man of aristocratic background, he was a constant presence in the popular cafés, concert halls, and brothels of Montmartre as he sought escape from the despair brought on by physical handicaps. He also circulated freely among artists and intellectuals of the day. His poster for La Revue blanche, an adventurous literary magazine, depicts Misia Natanson, the wife of one of the editors and a celebrated muse whose salons he frequented. Toulouse-Lautrec took up lithography at a high point in its history, when technical advances in color printing and new possibilities for large scale led to a proliferation of posters as well as prints for the new bourgeois collector. In his short career, he created more than three hundred fifty prints and thirty posters, as well as lithographed theater programs and covers for books and sheet music, all of which brought his avant-garde visual language into a broad public arena. For technical expertise, he depended on master craftsmen to share their knowledge. One such printer, Père Cotelle of the Ancourt workshop, is seen at his printing press on the cover for the L'Estampe originale portfolio, while Toulouse-Lautrec's friend, the performer Jane Avril, inspects a fresh impression of a print. Whether advertising a product, like the new paper form of confetti, or entertainers in a well-known can-can troupe, Toulouse-Lautrec's posters were noteworthy for their highly simplified and abstracted designs. Inspired by Japanese woodblock prints, the artist incorporated diagonal perspectives, abrupt cropping, patterns of vivid, flat color, and sinuous lines to achieve an immediacy and directness that went far beyond the illustrative charm of other poster makers of the day.","Printing (0.950707), Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (0.752563), Lithography (0.67171), Jane Avril (0.615792), Moulin Rouge (0.580992), Printmaking (0.535395), Ukiyo-e (0.534283), Art Nouveau (0.509853)"

He rejected the Impressionist practice of studying effects of light on the external world and instead looked inward to explore themes of love and jealousy, loneliness and anxiety, and sickness and death. His personal history, with the premature loss of his mother and an older sister, as well as complex and unsatisfactory entanglements with women, provided him with a constant source of artistic motifs. The practices of painting, drawing, and printmaking were intertwined for Munch as he reinvestigated the same themes throughout his career. Printmaking was particularly conducive to this practice since he could save his plates, stones, and woodblocks for reuse time and again. Working with professional printers, or availing himself of a press in his studio, he explored some seven hundred fifty subjects in prints, varying his imagery in nearly thirty thousand impressions. Such experimentation can be seen here in red and black examples of The Sick Child I, and in three versions of The Lonely Ones, interpreted in both woodcut and etching. Munch sometimes used the same motif in a painting and a print, and a comparison of the two shows the print to be greatly simplified, achieving a sense of essence. Complex emotions are distilled into universal symbols by removing narrative references. Woodcut, in particular, lent itself to this approach. Munch's practice of cutting his blocks like a jigsaw puzzle in order to ink them in sections also enhanced a sense of isolation and abstraction. And the way in which he allowed the patterns of the wood grain to affect his compositions gave an indication of primordial significance. With this approach, the viewer senses artistic process as well as motif, something that would become an underlying component in much twentieth-century art.","Edvard Munch (0.97924), Woodcut (0.941673), Symbolism (0.810278), Printmaking (0.768063), Expressionism (0.764523), The Sick Child (0.618682), Wood (0.60817), Abstraction (0.585731)"

He evolved his expressive figural style through an extensive study of sources ranging from classical sculpture to illustrations in the popular press. In the 1970s he began communicating his universal themes by referencing specific events and contexts in series centered on political leaders, mercenaries, and victims of torture. His monumental unstretched canvases portray disturbing tableaux of evil and human vulnerability in a piercing critique of contemporary society. Golub has completed more than one hundred thirty prints since making his first lithographs in 1946 in his native Chicago. He works in lithography, screenprint, and etching and often explores his images through varying states and colors. He frequently employs photographic processes to generate an initial image, which he then manipulates, distorts, and reworks before printing. Golub has collaborated with a variety of workshops, including Tamarind Lithography Workshop in the mid-1960s and Rutgers Center for Innovative Print and Paper in New Brunswick, New Jersey, more recently. He also frequently self-publishes his prints. Golub's White Squad series depicts policemen in scenes of government-sponsored abuse. In this lithograph he reiterates images from two related paintings, dramatically juxtaposing them on a stark background in a shocking vision of terror. The abrupt cropping of the arm in the upper right, and Mannerist distortion of the looming head at the left, are typical of Golub's jarring compositional strategies. In addition, by turning the gaze of one of the abusers out of the picture frame, Golub implicates the viewer as a bystander in the horrifying event unfolding and intensifies the unsettling psychological impact of the composition.","Printmaking (0.980877), Printing (0.652169), Lithography (0.612322), Intaglio (0.475344), Printing press (0.41253), Activism (0.395241), Image (0.394537), Offset printing (0.393803)"

Alternating between figurative and abstract approaches, his work intentionally defies stylistic categorization. He was first recognized in the early 1960s as co-founder, with Sigmar Polke and others, of Capitalist Realism, a group dedicated to the objective depiction of society in an increasingly commodity-oriented Germany. Photography was central to Richter's pictorial documentation and his rejection of the Expressionist painting popular at the time. In 1962 he began making paintings directly after photographs, family snapshots, or newspaper illustrations, aligning himself with a European manifestation of Pop art. But by constantly questioning modes of perception and artistic representation, he has given his work an element of Conceptual art as well. Richter began making prints in 1965 and has completed more than one hundred to date; he was most active before 1974, completing projects only sporadically since that time. He has explored a variety of photographic printmaking processes—screenprint, photolithography, and collotype—in search of inexpensive mediums that would lend a ""non-art"" appearance to his work. Although interested in the wide dissemination of imagery that printmaking offers, he has avoided the collaborative workshop prerequisites of the more traditional techniques. This print reveals the political undertones common in Richter's work of the late 1960s. His imagery of fighter planes reflects the World War II bombing of his native Dresden as well as the hotly debated topic of German rearmament raging in the national press at the time. The work's off-register printing simulates the hazy afterimage of mass-produced newspaper illustrations while also emphasizing the planes' sonic speed.Originally from TextEntryID 69523 (TextTypeID 127)waiting for editorial approval on changes in text before authorizing - j.maldonado - 9/21","Gerhard Richter (0.943789), Sigmar Polke (0.672419), Painting (0.653657), World War II (0.625011), Kunstakademie Dsseldorf (0.616877), History of painting (0.576013), Art (0.558334), Expressionism (0.551883)"

No photographer before him had pictured domestic life—black or white—with such unsentimental tenderness.To make a picture, a photographer must be in the presence of the subject. This simple fact, often overlooked, except where inaccessible mountain peaks or bloody battlefields plainly have demanded the photographer's resourcefulness or heroism, is a fundamental condition of photography. It helps to explain the relative rarity (apart from snapshots) of intimate pictures of domestic life: to photograph in another person's home, the photographer must be invited inside.","Langston Hughes (0.967396), Photography (0.94355), Harlem Renaissance (0.763558), Subject (0.696133), Psychology (0.623934), IMAGE (0.594474), Louis Althusser (0.59434), Photograph (0.589995)"

Rational as his structures are, they follow organic principles. Like the Minimalist artists who emerged alongside him in the early 1960s, Smith favored geometric shapes and impersonal surfaces, and was alert to the artwork's exchange with the space around it; but he was actually a contemporary of the Abstract Expressionists, and unlike the Minimalists he worked intuitively. ""All my sculpture,"" he said, ""is on the edge of dreams.""Despite its self-evident logic, Moondog tricks the eye. Symmetrical and upright from some angles, from others it leans to one side, and its interlocking planar patterns seem to twist and shift as the viewer moves. The form was inspired by a photograph of a little jade house, and Smith interpreted it variously as a human pelvis and a Korean garden lantern.

Her own printmaking began in the late 1930s, after she married and moved to New York from Paris. As a fledging painter and printmaker, she gravitated to Atelier 17, the celebrated workshop established in New York in the 1940s by Stanley William Hayter. She enjoyed the company of fellow Europeans who gathered there in the war years, but also worked on prints at home, using a small press.After turning to sculpture in the late 1940s, Bourgeois virtually abandoned printmaking until the late 1980s, when her newly found celebrity brought with it numerous invitations to make prints. She began working with Peter Blum Edition and Osiris Editions, both of New York, and also responded to many requests for benefit prints for social causes. This reacquaintance with the medium awakened a natural but dormant inclination to scratch, scrape, and burnish copperplates, and it is the intaglio techniques that she favors, although she makes lithographs intermittently with Judith Solodkin of SOLO Press. For intaglio she has a fertile collaborative relationship with printer Felix Harlan of Harlan & Weaver workshop. Overall, Bourgeois has made some four hundred prints, in a creative process that involves constant revision and overworking with hand additions as her imagery evolves. The personal themes of loneliness, anxiety, sexual tension, and jealousy have preoccupied Bourgeois since her early years as an artist and continue to find expression in her sculpture, installations, and prints. She has called her ongoing narrative ""a drama of the self,"" and its embodiment in art has been an essential mechanism for controlling her volatile emotions.","Printmaking (0.954792), Stanley William Hayter (0.478072), Printing (0.456168), World War II (0.412836), Lithography (0.403645), Edition (0.361636), Intaglio (0.350039), Artist's proof (0.347767)"

A practicing architect, Power had written a multivolume book, English Medieval Architecture, which he illustrated himself, and had taught architecture at colleges and universities in London. Several years after finishing his military service in World War I, Power left his family and decamped for London, where he enrolled in art school with Sybil Andrews, a younger artist who became his collaborator for nearly twenty years. In 1925 Power was a member of the founding faculty of the Grosvenor School of Art, a liberal institution that encouraged students to think for themselves. It was there that he met Claude Flight, Britain's most devoted proponent of the linoleum cut technique, and began to study under him. He eventually completed forty-six linoleum cuts and also made numerous drypoints and monotypes, as well as works in oil, watercolor, and pastel. Like many of his contemporaries, Power was fascinated by the new machine age in which he lived, surrounded by fast cars, locomotives, and other new technologies. These were often the motifs featured in his work, as he attempted to depict the speed and dynamism of the modern experience. Speed Trial was inspired by Bluebird, the racecar that broke the land-speed record seven times between 1927 and 1935 with speeds ranging from 174 to 301 miles per hour. Via a loose series of repetitive, rhythmic curves, Power conjures up a sense of the rushing wind created as the aerodynamic car speeds past the viewer. He printed a variety of experimental trial proofs, such as this one in a single color, before finalizing the composition, adding a background color and creating a standardized edition.","Speed (0.935785), Middle Ages (0.911663), Cyril Power (0.907963), Claude Flight (0.90397), Linocut (0.891667), Sybil Andrews (0.846451), Visual arts (0.833597), Miles per hour (0.759305)"

Representations of Hill's ear and foot lie side by side; tucked modestly behind them is an image of his groin. Within this unassuming configuration, each raster invites meditation. For example, on one screen a thumb plays with the corner of a book page. By concentrating the viewer's attention on such a rudimentary activity, Hill causes the movement to take on the significance of a much larger event. The ceaselessness of the activity is an illusion in that each component exists only as a seamless loop lasting five to thirty seconds.Long, nervelike black wires attached to each monitor are bundled together like spinal cords. They snake along a shelf and disappear from view at the back of a recess. This electrical network emphasizes the presentation of body parts as extremities without a unifying torso. The hidden core to which the components of the body are attached serves as a metaphor for a human being's invisible, existential center: the soul.

Kirchner's color woodcut, Mit Schilf werfende Badende (Bathers throwing reeds), shows nudes moving freely in nature.

He is one of several artists exploring issues of sexual and cultural identity who emerged in the 1980s. His slightly distorted beds, cribs, sinks, and drains speak to difficult childhood memories and an unease with the domestic rituals and lingering puritanical attitudes of the suburban middle class. His surrealistic wax body parts, so extremely fetishized as to include actual human body hair, prompt contradictory sensations of terror, longing, and dissociation. Gober has extended his trompe l'oeil methods into printmaking by fashioning several editions of photolithographs that look just like newspaper pages. Newspaper, shown here, is from a group of thirty-two bundles tied with twine that resemble stacks ready for recycling. Each version was produced in an edition of either five or ten, and all were originally used in a 1993 installation at the Dia Center for the Arts. To make them, Gober inserted his own manipulated photographs into layouts based on various national newspapers. Here a photograph that initially appears to be a typical bridal advertisement is, in fact, an image of Gober himself wearing a wig and a wedding dress. The individual print also shows Gober as a bride and is juxtaposed with a story about the Vatican condoning discrimination against homosexuals. These works, which are related to the artist's 1989 sculpture of a satin wedding dress, are concerned with marriage as an institution and rite of passage presently denied in the United States to Gober as a homosexual. These projects are among more than forty prints and multiples that Gober has produced since the late 1980s. They include other works incorporating photolithography, as well as hand-drawn lithographs, etchings, screenprints, and unlimited editions of screenprinted wallpaper, originally devised for installations.","Printmaking (0.961561), Hair (0.494044), Newspaper (0.444657), Wedding (0.420065), Printing (0.393537), Human body (0.368173), Wedding dress (0.328141), United States (0.316795)"

The ""escape"" of their title, then, lies not so much in their mobility as in their provision of a retreat tailor-made for one individual's comfort.Simultaneously aesthetic and useful, the escape vehicles challenge the idea of the artwork as an object of contemplation. They implicitly argue that artists can participate in their societies rather as designers and architects do—by producing works with practical and benign applications in daily life. In this way Zittel belongs to a tradition of social involvement running back to the Bauhaus and the Russian Constructivists. A more recent precedent of a different kind is Pop art, with its attraction to vernacular and commercial visual forms and production methods. The name ""A–Z"" is a pun, fusing the idea of embracing inclusiveness with the artist's initials.

In 1967, on the recommendation of Philip Johnson, a committee charged with building such a memorial in New York City commissioned Louis Kahn to design it. The monument was to be situated in Battery Park, at the southern tip of Manhattan, where it would have distant views of the Statue of Liberty. Kahn proposed an abstract design: a granite pedestal supporting seven glass piers, so that, in his words, ""the sun could come through and leave a shadow filled with light."" This spectacular image, the sole drawing included in an exhibition devoted to the Memorial at The Museum of Modern Art in 1968, captures the sense of transparency and reflection that Kahn envisioned through loose, energetic strokes of charcoal pencil on the luminous yellow paper. The drawing focuses on the central glass pier, made of glass blocks etched with inscriptions in Hebrew and English, and built to contain a small circular chapel. Around this central space are the other six piers, all of them solid glass. Kahn described the immaterial quality these vitreous forms would have: ""Changes of light, the seasons of the year, the play of the weather, and the drama of movement on the river will transmit their life to the monument."" This structure of light embodied hope as well as despair. The project is contemporary with one of Kahn's last philosophical concepts, ""silence and light,"" where light symbolizes the source of life and the inspiration of the creative act.","New York City (0.94427), Pencil (0.73834), Statue of Liberty (0.72535), Light (0.710206), Museum of Modern Art (0.690689), Charcoal (0.677224), Modern art (0.639781), Memorial (0.623604)"

Allen plays the title character, a down-on-his-luck manager who represents such marginal ""talent"" as a balloon act, a blind xylophone player, skating penguins, and a water-glass musician. His one remotely successful client is Lou Canova, a singer he manages to book into the Waldorf–Astoria. When Canova insists that Danny go to New Jersey and pick up his mistress so that she can attend his show, an unexpected odyssey through suburban Jersey and Manhattan ensues, leading to a contract on Danny's life. As with many of Allen's best films, the plot of Broadway Danny Rose is intricate and carefully laid out, but it is ultimately a mere hook on which to hang the many colorful characters and funny situations at which Woody Allen excels. There is no underlying message in this film, nor does it attempt to speak to any deeper human condition. Broadway Danny Rose is, simply, a comedy, a film designed to entertain and amuse.

I cannot concentrate on the here and now. On you. I cannot concentrate on the here and now, be concentrique. You cannot concentrate on the “hear” and now. You are not looking at me. Your eyes are trembling. You are trembling. Your gaze is nowhere. Your hands are trembling, your legs are cold, and your eyes are trembling more and more. I want to concentrate on your fearful face because I feel you trying to escape, to get into orbit, and to leave, but there is nowhere to go.I cannot concentrate because I just hate it, anywhere but here. Is it fear? Fear of what? I am not actively or passively fearful, I am as tight as a knot and as hard as stone. I know enough not to talk. What for? Talk at the antipodes of what I want? No thank you. The humming bird is my friend I am a humming bird. The present minute is all important, but I do not care. I want out. That is why I cannot concentrate. From inside I feel propulsed out. Anything, anyone, anywhere will do, in order to be awayfrom what? From yourself, a thought, a wish, a need, a must of some kind. This revelation is anti-object. In that state if I call you I do not relate to you (any phone number would do). I relate to the avoided. I write this as an escape from expectation.I cannot get out of the house. I want to. I have to. I would like to. I was planning to, but I gave up at the last minute. It would help to be completely ready, waiting by the door, it would make things easier: some nice feelings will help, familiar, friendly place to go to, no trust, no lift, the disappearance of the love object.What can I do for you? This is the password.What can I do? What can I do for you, Dialogue, listen, listen and learn. I have fallen from Grace. I panic in my fear of not being able to help. I panic, I am afraid, made frantic in my despair or desir or desperate wish to help [sic]. I want I want I want I want at all cost to impress the person who needs help. It is indispensable to understand the challenge, the irresistible want or need, to absolutely prove that I can save a soul from suffering. This is it: the challenge to defend someone. Père gardez vous à droite. Père gardez vous à gauche J'acheverai mon salut en sauvant quelqu'un. Peut-être en sauvant un ou une perdue, damnée, blessée, mourrant je suis la serveuse et c'est mon destin. Le remplirai-je ou non l'évangelisme est mon salut. Incroyable mais vrai. Do you hear, parle français, l'appel au secours, sauvez-moi, c'est le cri qui me challenge, c'est derrière l'attrait de la restauration, reparation, self-defeatism. Sauvez-moi du suicide, sauvez de la noyade, sauvez-moi s'il vous plaît de ces mauvaises habitudes, de mes fautes, de ma maladie, de ma defaite, de mon malheur, de mon destin. Je vous aimerai et je vous sauverai de votre propre pessimisme. C'est le prix du self-estime, c'est la rançon du pardon, vous serez pardonneur aura vous mériterez votre salut si vous sauvez une autre. Vous voyez les reverberations de cette admission de peine je suis tombée en disgrace, c'est le pire, c'est la chute, c'est fini, sauve moi. Un éclair une décharge éléctrique me passe entre les deux tempes et la challange est expériencée comme une terreur, c'est le chapitre de la Peur qui me revient la peur ou plutôt la terreur me terrace, me confuse et me rend spinning around et totalement dépourvue. Il n'est pas question d'apprendre car je suis totalement détruite par la peur, je suis agressée par la devorante, c'est incroyable mais c'est vrai. A ce moment je veux compenser et impressionner les gens, je suis de l'autre côté du désespoir, et cela m'arrive quatre fois par jour, j'en ai marre, je veux abandonner et ne voir personne, fuir, boucle, bonsoir. The system. I learn, I learned, I learned, I learned, I learned, I learned, I learned, you blew it. I learned a lot, I learned something, I did learn. Did you? I learned today, and it made my day. I learned a lesson, I feel better, to learn. I learn, you learn, he learns, you learn, we learn, they learn, we learn together, and we begin to understand each other. Make no demand on me the way I make no demand on you. Let us just learn a little every day, try to. It is so difficult to learn. What keeps us from learning? Be in a learning spirit, do not be afraid to spend time learning. You have lots of time, I have lots of time, we have lots of time. If we just learn nothing will go wrong. Just be receptive, just be accepting, just be tolerant, just be self-loving, not self-indulgent, not selfish, but self-respecting, self-forgiving, self-relating, self-undemanding, self-repeating, self-unafraid, self-trusting, and learning will be less difficult. Do not pass judgment, wait and see. Give it a chance, try again, so many chances, so much time, so much patience, give yourself a chance, as you give them a chance, endless chances, every day is a new chance, tomorrow too a whole life time of chances, no reason to despair, no reason to be finding complaining, pushing, wanting, extracting from the others or yourself. The others do not judge you, they do not even know that you are there, no one is against you, do not worry, you are not that compelling. Who are they to judge you? They do not know enough, they are going to learn about you, and so they will begin to understand you. To understand is to forgive - no problem - but you certainly have to learn, to understand and that is truly difficult - whether it is mysterious, complicated, heavy duty, or weird. To learn is difficult, but it is rewarding. Try again, and start again tomorrow and cry if you have to. Learn to learn. Do you like to learn? Are you good at it? Do you get there? Learn for the sake of learning for itself, be crafty at it. Do you have the knack to learn to discover, to uncover, to turn upside-down and side-up again. To deconstruct and reconstruct, to make sense out of the unlikely, learn to answer, to question to make out the other one for the sake of discovering, not telling anybody that you progressed step by step, from position to position, you put the puzzle together. You learn for yourself not for the others, not to show off, not to put the other one down. Learning is your secret; it is all you have. It is the only thing you can call your own, nobody can take it, and remember ignorance is no excuse, you better learn or else.Translation of the French portion embedded in this text is as follows: Father, look out to the right. Father, look out to the left I shall accomplish my salvation by saving someone. Perhaps by saving a lost soul, someone damned, wounded, dying I am the waitress and that is my destiny. Whether I fulfill it or not evangelism is my salvation. Incredible but true. Do you hear, speak French, the cry for help, save me, it's the cry that challenges me, it's behind the appeal of restoration, reparation, self-defeatism. Save me from suicide, save from drowning, save me please from those bad habits, from my faults, from my illness, from my defeat, from my unhappiness, from my destiny. I will love you and save you from your own pessimism. That is the price of self-esteem, the ransom of pardon, you will be pardoned you will deserve your salvation if you save someone else. You see the reverberations of that admission from torment I fell into disgrace, that's the worst, that's the fall, it's over, save me. A flash of electrical discharge passes between my two temples and the challenge is experienced as a terror, it's the chapter of fear that comes back to me Fear or rather terror lays me low, confuses me and leaves me spinning around and totally bereft. There's no question of learning because I am totally destroyed by fear, I am assailed by the devourer, it's incredible but it's true. At this moment I want to make it up to people and impress them, I am on the far side of despair, and that happens to me four times a day, I've had enough, I want to give up and see no one, run away, wrap up, good night.

In the first frame, a central square (or ""cell,"" in Halley's terminology) suggests a building in an empty landscape. Windowless and doorless, it has no apparent entrance or exit save for two ""conduits"": an underground pipeline below and a smokestack above. In the subsequent frames, read left to right like a comic strip, this cell is transformed into states of contamination, explosion, meltdown, and, finally, nothingness. For the installation Halley covered the walls behind the nine framed works with a simplified, black-and-white, endlessly repeatable version of these color screenprints. Conceived as a digital project, this wallpaper expands the boundaries of traditional printmaking; each time it is installed, a silkscreen printer must generate new sheets using digital files owned by MoMA.Influenced by theories about the hidden systems and ideologies that govern activity in postindustrial society, Halley continually re-creates his cells and conduits in ongoing series of painted and printed variations. In his printmaking he allows himself more freedom to play with their narrative possibilities, demonstrating that they are not simply abstract compositions but symbolic, diagrammatic representations of architectural and social bodies.","Printmaking (0.951012), Frame (0.82273), Screen-printing (0.775684), United States (0.691913), Printing (0.638347), Left-wing politics (0.633582), Printed circuit board (0.596735), Film (0.588035)"

In contrast to Trockel's sculptures, which are designed by her but executed by machine, this work seems to bear out the historical assumption that drawing is the most direct form of expression for an artist. As in a child's finger painting, the exaggerated form reveals every mark, and the artist's interaction with ink and paper becomes as much the subject of the work as its anonymous model.Trockel's artwork often deals with the effects of societal norms on women and the idea of ""women's work,"" but it is hard not to see this figure, with its long, pointy nose, as male. This leads to a variety of questions: Is he the innocent storybook character Pinocchio, whose nose grows longer the more he lies? Or is he more sinister, offering something grotesque and vaguely sexual?

His next step was to explore the artistic potential of the billboard's scale and photographic style.Rosenquist generally spikes that style with disorienting fractures and recombinations of images. F-111 becomes still more overwhelming through its particularly enormous size and panoramic shape: it is designed to fill the four walls of a room, engulfing and surrounding the viewer—unlike a billboard, which, despite its magnitude, can be viewed all at once.

In his conception of the project, the architect imagined the viewer as an organism with two bodies: the tangible ""primitive"" body that seeks light and air and the ""virtual"" body that seeks information. This project marked a watershed in a growing discourse about architecture's relationship to the virtual.The building consists of three elements: a series of weaving structural tubes, floor plates, and skin. It is conceived as a small piece cut out of an infinite structure, a gesture most evident in the lack of differentiation between the building's cross section and its understated facade. This implies that the building is a visible part of an infinite fabric that oscillates between materiality and immateriality—between the primitive and the virtual. Inside, aluminum partitions fuzzily reflect the structural tubes, which also seem to extend infinitely.

These drawings—six from a series of twenty—form a series of overlays that mimic Hadid's conception for the project: stacked planes of uninterrupted space that hover over the landscape. They were produced for a competion sponsored by the French government in 1982, and eventually won by Bernard Tschumi in March 1983, that entailed designing a park for the twenty-first century. The park was to be located in a terraine vague, a 125-acre site that had once housed a group of slaughterhouses in the northeast corner of Paris, between the outer fringes of the city and the peripheral highway that borders it to the north. Hadid proposed a series of elevated mobile gardens, which were to move in random or controlled orbits and change with the seasons—a virtual galaxy of kiosks, picnic areas, restaurants, and gardens. One might experience this park the way one sees an architectural section—as a vertical slice through the landscape, where one would encounter unforeseen and infinite juxtapositions of space. Nature in this sense became an artificial construct, and the landscape, rather than a picturesque paysage, a laboratory of discovery. These elements of surprise are the point of both Hadid's project and her drawings. Just as the mechanized movement of the gardens becomes a kind of calligraphy on the ground, Hadid's precise mark-making becomes a form of research into the possibilities of architecture. Her preferred method of black and white drawing explores elemental constructs, and when she does use color, rather than being decorative, it reveals the mood and quality of the space. Hadid is perhaps best known as a theoretical architect; the Vitra Fire Station, Weil am Rhein, completed in 1993, was her first built work, and the Terminus Nord, a transportation center in Strasbourg, is scheduled to be completed early in 2002. Her affinity with the Russian Constructivists and Suprematists of the 1920s lies less with formal drawing conventions than in an attitude of experimentation without need for conclusion, and in an expression of hope for new forms of architecture that go beyond what we know.","Zaha Hadid (0.965201), Basel (0.893627), Weil am Rhein (0.861833), Parc de la Villette (0.830242), Vitra (0.721554), Deconstructivism (0.699913), Bernard Tschumi (0.570872), Paris (0.551293)"

Provisional as it appears, it plainly demonstrates the character and stance of the future headquarters of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. Made of eight vertical mast assemblies and five great trusses that provide lateral stiffness and support the floors, the complex structure, engineered by the premier firm of Ove Arup & Partners, reveals itself on its surface to dramatic expressive effect. The lateral view shows the towers that contain the elevators, utilities, and stairs, as well as the trusses working as wind braces. Foster won a competition to replace the bank's old headquarters, built in 1936. The site faces north, toward mainland China, and also overlooks Statue Square and the harbor. Foster's building is magnificent and majestic, but it was initially criticized by Hong Kong residents because of its indifference to the rules of feng shui, the Chinese system of harmonizing oneself physically with the natural universe. (Among other defects, the building arrested the paths of dragons coming down from the mountain to drink from the bay.) As a matter of fact, Foster's buildings often reveal a deeper interest in themselves than in the rest of the world; their exploration of their own internal possibilities, and of the possibilities of technology, is often a stronger motive in the design than any concern for the building's site or for the local culture. It is through this single-mindedness, on the other hand, that Foster's work has advanced architecture. His contributions to the built world—whether in London, Tokyo, or Hong Kong—have sometimes made earthly cities more interesting than science fiction.Originally from TextEntryID 73734 (TextTypeID 133)add link to ""the lateral view"",  (356.1996.2)","Hong Kong (0.982345), China (0.894217), Mainland China (0.875413), People's Republic of China (0.798274), Norman Foster (0.752149), Physics (0.688596), Feng shui (0.663695), 30 St Mary Axe (0.645651)"

Thus, his studies at once analyze motion and present a virtual image of its course. Photography has radically enhanced our ability to study the world around us (and the skies beyond) by making visible what once had been too distant, too small, too fast, or otherwise too difficult to see. Many such pictures were made in the service of science, but their impact often has been much broader than their original scientific function.

For some, it may also have a subtle fetishistic eroticism, inasmuch as it focuses on a narrow band of the body where men routinely and unselfconsciously show their nakedness.Many of the artists who emerged alongside Gober in the 1980s were interested in the modern communications media, or in quoting from art history. Gober, by contrast, insists on the handmade quality of his sculpture, and although his works can remind us of earlier art (this one, for example, may recall the body fragments in the sculpture of Auguste Rodin, or the living disembodied arms bearing candelabra in Jean Cocteau's film La Belle et la béte, of 1946), their mood of displaced normalcy transforms any such references.

During his time in Paris, Kawara experimented with a variety of styles, in the course of which he began making drawings based on calendars. These works prepared the ground for the conceptual leap he made shortly after his arrival in New York, resulting in a dramatic reorientation of his art and the integral programming of his production.On January 4, 1966, Kawara made the first of his ""Today"" series, of which the work in this collection, April 24, 1990, is an example. Each consists of a neatly hand-lettered canvas commemorating the day of its creation. The canvases are stored in specially made cardboard boxes containing pages from a local newspaper of the same day and from whatever place the peripatetic artist happened to find himself in when he made the painting. Kawara does not paint every day—in the first year of this series, he made 241 such works—nor are all his canvases identical; the background tone varies from grays to reds to blues, and the typeface changes as well....Kawara's idiosyncratically interconnected tabulations encompass both the small routines that measure out quotidian existence and the virtual infinity of millennia succeeding millennia. At either extreme, Kawara takes care to remind us how time's passage simultaneously isolates individuals in their own reality and binds them to collective reality. This divided consciousness is explicit in April 24, 1990. Like every other painting of its kind, it is the work of a man sitting alone at his desk. The physical encapsulation of the time it took to make (because of the layering of paint and the necessary drying periods, completion of each tablet- or tombstonelike work takes many hours), it adds to the series as a whole while it counts down, and so subtracts from, the unknown remainder of its creator's days.","Division (0.88953), Remainder (0.884579), Calendar (0.873656), Modular arithmetic (0.85303), Ontology (0.836508), January 4 (0.833183), The Work (0.814303), Panel painting (0.81011)"

The term refers to nineteenth-century painters who created their own printed compositions as opposed to those who made reproductive prints based on the work of others. Degas had a rather unusual approach to making prints, which he did for his own private experience and experimentation rather than for a public audience. Thus, although he completed approximately sixty-six printed compositions, only four of these were published in editions during his lifetime. The bulk of his graphic output consists of trial proofs, working proofs, states, variants, unique monotypes, and hand-colored impressions that document the tireless reworking, scraping, and erasing that were part of his artistic process. Degas's involvement with prints is visible throughout his career. He copied Old Master etchings by Rembrandt and Velázquez as an early form of study; later he made lithographs of modern urban scenes, using the café-concert, theater, ballet, and streets of Paris as his subjects. He kept an etching press in his studio and constantly experimented by combining mediums and using unorthodox tools. He even planned a never-realized journal, Le Jour et la nuit, with artist friends Mary Cassatt, Camille Pissarro, and Félix Bracquemond that would have issued original prints to subscribers. In addition, Degas was perhaps the most prolific and innovative practitioner of monotype during the nineteenth century, completing hundreds of compositions during his lifetime. These two monotypes, among fifty landscape motifs made between 1890 and 1893, were inspired by a twenty-day carriage trip through Burgundy.

Three months before, nearly one million Rwandans had been systematically killed during one hundred days of civil unrest. Sensing an urgent need for action, immediately following his return home Jaar initiated his epic Rwanda Project, which took many forms over the subsequent six years. This photolithograph, produced for an exhibition in Malmö, Sweden, is one of the project's earliest manifestations. Adopting a commercial aesthetic, Jaar mounted four hundred of these prints on backlit displays in public locations throughout the city. Residents encountered the signs on a regular basis as they went about their daily activities.For over twenty years, Jaar has explored thorny social, political, and humanitarian issues in his work. Producing poetic yet disturbing installations often composed of text, photographs, and architectural elements, he hunts for effective means to represent complex and weighty topics often trivialized by conventional media outlets. This print, with its bold lettering and hypnotic repetition, is minimalist in its simplicity, yet its almost abstract design is infused with grave subject matter. This juncture of form and content reveals Jaar's sleight of hand: through seductive and eloquent beauty, he brings viewers to a contemplation of some of humanity's most appalling moments.","Abstract art (0.899865), Sleight of hand (0.781565), Subject matter (0.779719), Million (0.778032), 1994 (0.777853)"

In 1956 he emigrated to West Berlin, where the dominant style was tachisme, a form of painterly abstraction that corresponded to late Abstract Expressionism in America. Baselitz rejected that style as decorative and instead evolved a vocabulary of disturbing figurative imagery that caused a scandal when it was exhibited. Eventually the figures in his paintings were depicted as fragmenting apart and soon thereafter were turned upside-down in what has become his hallmark. Baselitz's early experiences with printmaking began at a municipal workshop for artists in West Berlin. He started with etching and soon turned to woodcut. During a stay in Italy in the mid-1960s, he discovered sixteenth-century Mannerist prints and began a personal collection that is now well known. He also tried the tonal ""chiaroscuro"" woodcut technique prevalent in that early period, here seen in an untitled example depicting a fragmented woodsman, one of the figure types he presented as modern heroes. Having made nearly one thousand prints in the course of his career, Baselitz stands out for his direct engagement with technical processes. He has described the resistance of copperplates, woodblocks, and linoleum blocks as creative forces in his art and has referred to prints as having ""symbolic power which has nothing to do with a painting."" He is also known for distinctive printed surfaces created with oil paint rather than printer's ink. Woman on the Beach and Nude with Three Arms are examples, and these prints garnered much attention during the Neo-Expressionist movement of the late 1970s and 1980s, when linoleum cut and woodcut had a great resurgence. Baselitz's wife, Elke, often assists him with printing, using a press in his studio, although he also works with master printers.","Linocut (0.960792), Woodcut (0.899443), Printmaking (0.732041), Neo-expressionism (0.711023), Printing (0.705051), Lyrical Abstraction (0.704139), Painting (0.671139), Abstract art (0.655378)"

Above and below landscape formation."" The bulbous, knotted forms, spread over two sheets of paper in disjointed and contorted spaces, signal the artist's desire to formulate his own pictorial language. They also point to his fascination with the Mannerist painters, such as the Italians Jacopo da Pontormo and Parmigianino, as well as with what he considered ""outsider"" art, namely, the work of Antonin Artaud, Vincent van Gogh, and August Strindberg, for example, and the expressive visual language of the art of the insane. These nightmarish, amorphous, distorted, almost putrefying shapes express a sense of anger, alienation, disease, and decay that informed the artist's vision in the early 1960s.Several of Baselitz's paintings of 1962—63 include similar knotted forms, which continued to populate his work throughout most of the decade, culminating in the famous Heroes series. These works mark his search for symbols and vocabulary that assert his own identity and iconography, which, at the time, expressed themselves through the introduction of disjointed fragments of the body, placed in irrational spaces.

Abraham envisioned a new Venice free of historical pastiche, which would intensify the original elements of the city—the lagoon, winding canals with stone bridges, and the interplay between light and shadow. Like many architects in the 1970s, Abraham was interested in the essential nature of architecture and the topographical forms of the built environment. He wrote texts to accompany his drawings, which he considered to be autonomous works, not auxiliary to the act of building.

Woodcut, the only printmaking technique Kiefer uses, has played a central role in his work. However, rather than creating conventional prints published in standard editions, he incorporates woodcuts into paintings, groups them together to create works that rival the grand scale of his paintings, or uses them in his many illustrated books. To date he has completed approximately one hundred works incorporating the woodcut technique. In 1970 Kiefer began to study with Joseph Beuys at the Academy of Art in Dnsseldorf, where, under Beuys's influence, he embarked on a personal examination of the troubled legacy of Germany's past. He incorporated a wide range of diverse materials into his work, including photographs, straw, tar, lead, sand, and dried plants, as well as woodcut, a technique with a long and distinguished history in German art. Richard Wagner's opera cycle The Ring and the tragic fate of its protagonists Siegfried and Brunhilde form the backdrop for Grane. The heroic role of Brunhilde's horse, Grane, is a recurring motif in Kiefer's work. Here the horse is engulfed in the funeral pyre into which the heroine rides at a climactic moment in the opera. Kiefer's book Der Rhein can be seen as his response to the German tradition of landscape painters such as Caspar David Friedrich and others of the Romantic period. It epitomizes his use of the book format as an evocative metaphor for the communication of collective knowledge and memory.","Anselm Kiefer (0.968465), Painting (0.923426), Printmaking (0.893937), Caspar David Friedrich (0.863409), Richard Wagner (0.752283), Joseph Beuys (0.670928), Romanticism (0.652069), Landscape art (0.644839)"

In Bad Blooms, a series of thirteen photographs made in 1992 and 1993, Chadwick turned to flowers.What could be more natural than flowers?

The sanatorium was one of the first important commissions given to the Wiener Werkstätte, a collaborative founded in 1903 by Hoffmann and Koloman Moser espousing many of the English Arts and Crafts movement's tenets of good design and high-quality craftsmanship. It represents one of Hoffmann's earliest experiments in unifying a building and its furnishings as a total work of art. The Sitzmaschine makes clear reference to an adjustable-back English Arts and Crafts chair known as the Morris chair, designed by Philip Webb around 1866. It also stands as an allegorical celebration of the machine. This armchair, with its exposed structure, demonstrates a rational simplification of forms suited to machine production. Yet, at the same time, the grid of squares piercing the rectangular back splat, the bentwood loops that form the armrests and legs, and the rows of knobs on the adjustable back illustrate the fusion of decorative and structural elements typical of the Wiener Werkstätte style.

With an ironic and frequently humorous edge, he consistently fuses elements drawn from his African-American heritage with those of contemporary consumer culture. In the mid-1980s he became preoccupied with the steam iron as a domestic, symbolic, and artistic object and began assembling irons into iconic figural forms reminiscent of tribal art. The idea for the scorch came out of his search for ways to infuse his art with the potency of its African sources. Cole is a sporadic printmaker who has completed editions in lithography, woodcut, and digital techniques. His most common printmaking practice, scorching, reflects a sculptor's uniquely physical perspective. In a transfer branding process that constitutes the essence of printmaking, he imprints hot irons in minimal rows, decorative patterns, and figurative shapes on surfaces ranging from canvas and paper to mattress padding and plaster. The scorched ""faces"" of the irons take on masklike appearances while concurrently suggesting the African ritual of scarification and endowing many of these images with an almost mythic presence. The iron also alludes to Cole's own background, growing up in Newark, New Jersey, with a mother and a grandmother who worked as housekeepers and regularly asked him to repair their broken irons. In the early 1990s, Cole began incorporating a variety of irons in one work to allude to distinct tribal associations. In Domestic I.D. IV, he labels each scorch with a commercial brand name to encourage this interpretation, ironically suggesting the tribes of Silex, General Electric, or Sunbeam. The window frame reinforces the domestic references, and the buckling paper calls attention to the searing heat and violence in the work's creation, adding an overall ominous and poignant overtone.","Printmaking (0.966192), Allusion (0.62767), Literature (0.587066), Woodcut (0.559926), Intertextuality (0.518986), Comedy (0.488223), Lithography (0.456543), Rhetorical techniques (0.451211)"

He is closer to the Minimalist sculptor Dan Flavin, who also worked with light; but where Flavin would incorporate not only the light of fluorescent tubes but the tubes themselves into his art's appearance, the fluorescents in A Frontal Passage are obscured. The spec-tacle is light itself, given the illusion of palpable shape.To view A Frontal Passage, the visitor passes through a darkened entryway into a chamber, also dark—but divided diagonally by a radiant yet crisply defined wall of red light. Instead of diffusing freely from one side of this wall to the other, the light ends abruptly in space, as if it had density. The power of the work lies in this paradox, in which nothingness gains physical presence.","Sculpture (0.978322), Visual arts (0.650149), Fluorescent lamp (0.638183), Dan Flavin (0.574106), Energy (0.545432), Concept (0.512417), Modernism (0.500676), Conceptual art (0.491483)"

But the pictures have a grave and deliberate quality that creates an indelible impression of human presence.This picture from the Knoxville series is an exception, for something very dramatic might be happening.

A year later, at his own expense, Bellmer published Die Puppe (The Doll) (reprinted in French, as La Poupée, in 1936), a book of ten photographs documenting the stages of the doll's construction. The pictures created a stir among the Surrealists, who recognized its subversive nature, and French poet Paul Éluard decided to publish eighteen photographs of the doll in the December 1934 issue of the Surrealist journal Minotaure. In 1935 Bellmer constructed a second, more flexible doll, which he photographed in various provocative scenarios involving acts of dismemberment. These transformations of the doll's body offered an alternative to the image of the ideal body and psyche popularized in German fascist propaganda of the 1930s.","Jacques Offenbach (0.964467), The Tales of Hoffmann (0.893782)"

A psychiatrist, Dr. Fletcher (Mia Farrow), attempts to cure him, and the medical case becomes famous. Complications ensue, and to escape notoriety Zelig flees to Nazi Germany, where he is later found by Dr. Fletcher, who has fallen in love with him.Seamlessly combining archival film with contemporary footage, Zelig offers prescient commentary on the events of the twentieth century and on Allen's own public persona. Zelig pops up everywhere and oscillates between being an object of public adoration and of universal scorn; he anticipates the alienation of much of Allen's audience in the 1990s and beyond. Zelig takes on the coloration if not the full persona of whomever he is with, and this speaks to Allen's fundamental identity problem. Is he the nebbishy borscht-belt comic of his origins? Is he the Bergman, Fellini, or Antonioni of his dreams? Is he an ersatz Chaplin?

The book's square format, Vienna's favorite symbol of modernity, mirrored the dominant decorative motif throughout the cabaret, while Czeschka's playful marginal decorations suggested the increasingly ornamental style that took hold at the Werkstätte at this time.

The museum is located in a region containing over 200 burial mounds, or kofun, from that era, and there are a number of archaeological sites in the building's immediate neighborhood, which has been designated a historical park. As far as possible, then, Ando's design preserves the park's topography, altering it minimally through the use of architectural elements that serve more than one function: the building's roof doubles as sets of stairs leading up to an observation tower and plaza, together constituting stepped viewing platforms from which to look at the tombs in their natural surroundings. The concept focuses, Ando has said, ""on architecture's power to produce a new landscape"": like a large berm, the museum becomes an integral part of the landscape that the museum also serves to exhibit. Inside the building, objects excavated from the burial mounds are exhibited in a darkened interior, evoking the interiors of the tombs in which they were discovered. Ando's use of concrete as a construction material recalls the work of Le Corbusier and Louis Kahn, his architectural mentors, yet he combines this preference with a Japanese aesthetic of contrast-light and dark, interior and exterior, enclosed and expansive, hard and soft, nature and city, east and west. The subtle interplay of these opposites in Ando's buildings produces rich environments, and some of this is captured in the drawing: the hard-edged graphite lines marking the imposed, man-made structure offer a counterpoint to the softer shades of color depicting the enveloping landscape that Ando seeks to echo.","Construction (0.939374), Le Corbusier (0.905399), Tadao Ando (0.84942), Architecture (0.820713), Grave (0.815709), Mound (0.811949), Interior (0.7623), Cemetery (0.674011)"

Customers requesting plans and brochures from the Richards Company would have received prints like these illustrating the many house models from which they could have chosen. Modeled on Japanese woodblock prints, the style of Wright's lithographs evinces his life-long love of Japanese art. The high horizon line, the planar flatness of foreground and sky, the silhouetted foliage, and the red square (or ""chop"") framed by the text-all suggest a studied japonisme. Most likely the originals were prepared by Antonin Raymond, Wright's assistant on the contemporary Imperial Hotel project in Tokyo. The System-Built Houses were Wright's first experiment with mass production. Like many modern architects, he confronted both the benefits of the rationalized standardization associated with machine production and the desire for individual expression. ""Individuality is a national ideal"", Wright proclaimed in 1910, and for him this ideal was symbolized by the American house. Thus he developed a system that allowed variety within an overall unity. Regardless of house size and plan, most of the details were ""conventionalized"", a term Wright applied to a principle of abstracting form to its essentials. The houses were constructed of wood framing, floors, joists, rafters, roofs, and trim. To streamline the construction process, lumber was measured and precut in the Richards Company factory, then shipped to the site where it was to be assembled, thus saving the contractor and the customer time and money. Wright liked to give his houses descriptive names, for example La Miniatura (pp. 62-63), but the System-Built Houses bear perfunctory labels, such as D101. There were dozens of models, ranging from one to three stories, and the isometric plans illustrate numerous room configurations as well as ideas on how to furnish them. The designs recall Wright's earlier Prairie Houses, named for the landscape of his native Midwest. The characteristic low cantilevered roofs, the linear wood trim visually unifying the stucco wall planes, and the geometric decoration of the art-glass windows constitute a compelling modern alternative to the typical suburban bungalow. An untold number of System-Built Houses were built, mostly in the Midwest. In the following decades Wright continued to experiment with a range of materials and construction systems in an effort to reduce the expense of house building and to give industrialized methods character, expression, and personality.","Frank Lloyd Wright (0.965267), Chicago (0.576472), Ennis House (0.531764), United States (0.478505), Lloyd Wright (0.446323), Wisconsin (0.428228), Japan (0.42757), Oak Park, Illinois (0.414761)"

Bentwood furniture was made by steaming lengths of wood and then bending them and placing them in metal molds to dry.

The program required three principal spaces, respectively accommodating 100, 500, and 2,000 people, and all flexible enough to serve multiple purposes, from concerts to conventions. The hall was to be the centerpiece of a series of structures planned for the city and prefecture of Nara, the master plan for which was drawn up by Kisho Kurokawa. Isozaki's main structure takes the form of a gigantic ellipse that extends the length of the site. In the sketch plan the ellipse is first set along the axis of the city's preexisting grid, then is rotated twenty-three degrees, forming an entrance hall parallel to an adjacent railway station. The sculptural form tapers gently toward the roof (a vast field of glass-tube solar collectors). Though the form of the building is abstract, its curving profile and ponderous presence relate to the monumental roof forms of Nara's most notable monument, the Todaiji Temple, constructed in 734 A.D. Its exterior skin, sheathed in zinc and gray-ceramic tile, also recalls the dull luster of the traditional gray ibushi-style roofs of Todaiji and other important temple structures. The sketch and the computer-generated drawing, both of which appeared in an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art in 1992–93, together show the full range of graphic techniques available to Isozaki at the time. The sketch portrays the signature dimension of architectural design in its most generative form; the computer drawing is less personal, depicting not the act of generation but the end result of a long design process. Its cool tones and even surface render the qualities of the ceramic-tile skin, and provided a visual understanding of the total design well before construction was to begin.

As an active member of London's progressive Independent Group in the early 1950s, he first studied the impact of popular culture on art and created collages incorporating advertisements from mass-circulation newspapers and magazines, a technique that served as the basis for Interior. Through a complex layering of painting and photographic techniques, he continues to examine issues of illusion and the processes of image-making. Always eager to embrace new technologies, Hamilton has experimented with computer-generated imagery since the 1980s. Hamilton typically scrutinizes a motif through a variety of mediums, reiterating and reinterpreting from collage to painting to print, frequently combining techniques. An experimental and prolific printmaker, he has explored nearly every process except relief—from screenprint and collotype to intaglio and digital formats—since first trying etching in 1939. Although he remains preoccupied with photography and issues of reproduction, his more than two hundred prints range from mechanical manipulations of photographic images to intricate hand-drawn compositions, and he has collaborated with master printers around the world to achieve these wide-ranging effects. Hamilton was integral in revolutionizing the screenprint medium as a tool for artistic invention in the 1960s. For My Marilyn he appropriated publicity stills of Marilyn Monroe published in a British magazine after her suicide. Respecting Monroe's own hand-drawn Xs, Hamilton vowed not to make any marks of his own, choosing instead to create painterly effects by enlarging, masking, screening, and overprinting. At the other extreme in his work is the series of elaborate intaglios illustrating James Joyce's Ulysses, based on sketches from the 1940s. The transmogrifications of Bloom parallels the novel's surrealistic chapter in which Bloom metamorphoses through genders and guises during a midnight brothel encounter.","Printmaking (0.975666), Collage (0.831605), Marilyn Monroe (0.744075), James Joyce (0.683817), Ulysses (0.657291), 20th Century Fox (0.640173), American film actors (0.606248), Novel (0.568142)"

An ardent collaborator, she has been a committed printmaker since the mid-1980s and has completed more than one hundred fifty published prints and books in formats ranging from monumental multimedia prints and elaborate livres d'artistes to screenprinted tattoos and rubber stamps. Photography has also played an important role in her printmaking, particularly in the numerous self-portraits she completed in the 1990s at Universal Limited Art Editions and her most recent forays with digital prints at Pace Editions. Smith blurs the boundaries between prints and drawings, since many of her unique works on paper are printed. In her earliest work she addressed the fragility yet enduring spirit of life in stark, poignant depictions of internal and external fragments of the human body. Representing the body was Smith's way of learning about it and showcasing the importance of corporeal concerns. In Sueño she depicts the flayed body of a figure, revealing the musculature of this huddled form. Exemplifying her sculptural approach to printmaking, Smith used her own body as the template, lying on the copperplate and allowing the printers to trace her outline. In the mid-1990s she shifted her focus to the natural world, depicting birds, animals, and the cosmos in sculpture as well as prints and books. Birds have been of particular interest to her, both personally and symbolically, as a reference to the Holy Spirit. Peacock is the most commanding example of the many specimens she sketched in natural history museums, and later printed on several sheets of textured handmade paper in varying formats.","Printmaking (0.9633), Printing (0.818044), Spirit (0.644382), Museum (0.57061), Holy Spirit (0.558026), Human body (0.54054), Paper (0.531858), Sculpture (0.524818)"

Alternating between figurative and abstract approaches, his work intentionally defies stylistic categorization. He was first recognized in the early 1960s as co-founder, with Sigmar Polke and others, of Capitalist Realism, a group dedicated to the objective depiction of society in an increasingly commodity-oriented Germany. Photography was central to Richter's pictorial documentation and his rejection of the Expressionist painting popular at the time. In 1962 he began making paintings directly after photographs, family snapshots, or newspaper illustrations, aligning himself with a European manifestation of Pop art. But by constantly questioning modes of perception and artistic representation, he has given his work an element of Conceptual art as well. Richter began making prints in 1965 and has completed more than one hundred to date; he was most active before 1974, completing projects only sporadically since that time. He has explored a variety of photographic printmaking processes—screenprint, photolithography, and collotype—in search of inexpensive mediums that would lend a ""non-art"" appearance to his work. Although interested in the wide dissemination of imagery that printmaking offers, he has avoided the collaborative workshop prerequisites of the more traditional techniques. Portraiture has been an important genre for Richter, with Mao and Elisabeth II among the most haunting examples from this period.

No longer is she the narrator of events; in the video, actors fill the roles of Gudrun and the soothsayer. Taped in a studio then superimposed on shots of Iceland's vistas, the actors look like paper dolls pasted on the scenery — similar to what Jonas achieved with a projection backdrop in the original performances.The video frames the myth of Gudrun with a real–life story. In the video Jonas recounts that in the course of gathering footage for the work she traveled to a scenic region of Iceland; a storm suddenly rose and her car was blown off the road. Jonas implies that this harrowing event connects her to Iceland's preternatural terrain and to the vicissitudes of Gudrun's life. This autobiographical introduction is one of the many layers and folds of illusion and reality that vitalize Volcano Saga. The work is intricate, consonant with the perplexing ideas that science and technology contributed to everyday life in the final decades of the twentieth century.","Performance (0.885834), Projection (0.871297), The Work (0.870371), The Final (0.869509), Iceland (0.849696), 20th century (0.849401), English-language films (0.847069)"

Evenly dispersed as points in a four-by-four grid, each folly (with the exception of that on the lower right) is represented through an axonometric projection, painted red with gouache. Like The Manhattan Transcripts, the design for Parc de la Villette employs three autonomous systems: points, lines, and surfaces. Superimposed over the 125-acre expanse, each system also corresponds to the architectural method of disjuncture that Tschumi applied in the earlier work: points equal events; lines correspond to systems of movement; and surfaces are equivalent to systems of space. The Follies are the points, or pointlike activities, distributed evenly at 120-meter intervals. Each is a permutation on the same basic 10-by-10-cubic-meter frame. Where Zaha M. Hadid's proposal for the park can be understood through the simultaneity of a vertical section, Tschumi's tripartite system introduces a cinematic quality, or an order of time and sequence, into the landscape. Meaning is derived through the order of experience rather than the order of structure, as one's experience is conditioned by one's movement. Each Folly becomes an isolated frame within which space, movement, and events are contracted and between which architecture occurs. Drawn in 1986, four years after Tschumi made his initial proposal, the Follies read here like built objects in the landscape—static, sculptural forms. Yet as one's eye jumps from point to point and passes from medium to medium, the drawing, like the park, is constructed through movement. Red ink and red and white gouache painted over the white line of the photographic image become interchangeable notation systems in which the event forms the backdrop.Originally from TextEntryID 73728 (TextTypeID 133)removed references to manhattan transcripts...(see 3.1995.2, 3.1995.4, 7.1995.8, 9.1995.3)removed references to Zaha M.

Metabolist architects hoped that the use of biological processes as models would give them efficient ways to deal with the rapid growth and technological progress of societies all over the world. Their design philosophy involved gigantic buildings, of a size that Le Corbusier had envisioned and sometimes built in past decades. This monumental scale reflected operations they also saw at work in contemporary urban growth; their buildings were to become nodes in the organic fabric of the rapidly growing city. The Metabolist architect Fumihiko Maki is credited with coining the word ""megastructure"", in an essay of 1961; he defined it as ""a large frame in which all the functions of a city or part of a city are housed . . . [the frame is] made possible by present-day technology."" For the international movement of architects trying to design the ideal city of the future, ""megastructure"" became a key word. Kurokawa's impressive Helix City Project envisioned an organic city plan, shown in this drawing, based on service towers connected by an infrastructure of bridges spanning both land and sea. Residential buildings would neatly fill the spaces between, and the pattern could be repeated ad infinitum. Kurokawa, who had worked with Kenzo Tange on his generative Plan for Tokyo of 1960, based his architecture ""on the principle of life"", he stated in 1998. More than a utopian vision, his Helix City shows an attempt to respond to the dramatic shortage of dwelling space in modern Japan by distributing the built environment in a more structured and sensible way.","Kisho Kurokawa (0.94881), Architecture (0.74393), Metabolist Movement (0.718905), Le Corbusier (0.68754), Urban planning (0.637915), Kenzo Tange (0.532145), House (0.464859), City (0.451827)"

His aesthetic strategy, embracing screenprint on canvas, assemblage, set design, and performance, is based on collage and juxtaposes objects and images from the everyday world to elicit their effects on each other and to stimulate an almost poetic response in the viewer. Rauschenberg's prints now number nearly one thousand, but he needed the cajoling of Tatyana Grosman to attempt printmaking, during the fledgling years of the now-renowned publisher and printer Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE). His daring use of lithography appeared early on, when the stone for Accident broke in two while he was working on it. Undeterred, he retained the diagonal white gash through the composition, recording this event. When Accident won first prize at the prestigious Ljubljana Graphic Biennial in 1963, it established Rauschenberg, ULAE, and American printmaking in the forefront as never before. Rauschenberg continues to work at ULAE. Among his projects of the 1980s was the Soviet/American Array series, created for ROCI (Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange) and including his own photographs of New York and Moscow. This undertaking, fostering cultural exchange in cities outside the usual contemporary art circuit, reflects Rauschenberg's broad interest in social causes, expressed in numerous benefit prints over the years on subjects from ecology to world peace. Among his prints from other workshops, sheer technical audacity marks those produced at Gemini G.E.L. His first project there, a self-portrait entitled Booster, was the largest hand-pulled print to date in 1967.

In the late 1960s, Serra poured, splashed, and threw molten material against gallery and museum walls, originating the idea of ""process art."" More recently, he has made massive public steel sculptures that tilt, torque, and twist. Drawing comprises a more private but essential element of his creative process. He describes the eye as a muscle that must be exercised every day and carries notebooks so he can sketch as the mood strikes him. Considering printmaking to be an extension of drawing, Serra has been making prints since 1972, and has completed more than one hundred thirty editions. In 1989 Serra began a public sculpture, Afangar, on the small island of Videy, near Iceland's capital city of Reykjavik. During the project, which consists of nine pairs of basalt stelae erected throughout the island, Serra filled dozens of sketchbooks with related drawings. Working with Gemini G.E.L., his preferred print workshop, he decided to translate some of these drawings into prints, eventually completing twenty-nine etchings ranging in size from small to monumental. In an effort to achieve the dense texture of paintstick, a medium used in many drawings, and to provide an appropriate counterpart for the rough-hewn surface of the basalt stones, Gemini printers worked with Serra to develop an etching process that would give these prints the weight and physical presence required to emulate the massiveness of the sculpture. Afangar, the title for the sculpture, is taken from a mythic Icelandic poem and is understood by the artist to mean ""stations, stops on the road, to stop and look: forward and back, to take it all in.""

A teenager during the Spanish Civil War, he suffered from the isolation and repression of the Franco years but found recognition in the 1950s as part of Art informel, a European movement paralleling Abstract Expressionism in America. Termed ""matter painting,"" his work was noteworthy for thick, furrowed surfaces of sand, varnish, marble dust, and latex. This interest in audacious materials has continued, but Tàpies enriched his visual language in the ensuing decades to also include indications of cryptic writing, everyday objects, and a human presence. Tàpies's involvement with printmaking came at the invitation of several publishers, and he welcomed the new techniques it involved and the relationships he established with master craftsmen in printshops. He immediately sought to challenge the flatness of paper by adding such elements as straw and flocking, by tearing his sheets, and by creating surface indentations with carborundum or embossing. The large-scale Chairs represents the nature of the abstraction, imbued with shifting meanings, that has become his hallmark. Here calligraphic signs are transformed into furniture and then anthropomorphized into communicating protagonists.Tàpies has created some fifteen hundred printed images and also given sustained attention to illustrating books, creating some thirty-five volumes in collaboration with a range of contemporary poets. This is not surprising given the fact that he is an avid reader, essay writer, and committed bibliophile whose library rivals his painting studio as a center of his life. He has said that Anular is among his favorite books. He admires the physicality of its accordion format and the syncopation it creates from the combination of his own signs and symbols, the poetic phrases of author José-Miguel Ullán, and the old Spanish constitution that forms a backdrop.","Lyrical Abstraction (0.917012), Abstract expressionism (0.849155), Spain (0.781767), Art (0.750742), Catalonia (0.729925), Tachisme (0.720219), Sign (0.63274), Expressionism (0.614978)"

However, unlike many Pop artists, he focuses on the autobiographical and emotive connotations of his motifs. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he worked with Claes Oldenburg and Allan Kaprow to organize proto-performance art events known as Happenings. Soon after, drawing on childhood memories of his father's Cincinnati hardware store, Dine began making paintings incorporating real objects like hammers, C-clamps, and paintbrushes. For Dine, these objects functioned ""as a vocabulary of feelings."" An accomplished printmaker, Dine has created almost nine hundred prints to date, many of which have appeared in some twenty illustrated books. Since completing his first prints in 1960 at Pratt Graphic Art Center, he has mastered a wide range of lithographic, intaglio, and woodcut techniques. Dine was among a group of artists whom Tatyana Grosman invited to her legendary printshop, Universal Limited Art Editions, in the early years. He went on to work with many other printers and publishers, including Petersburg Press, Aldo Crommelynck, and Pace Editions. During the 1970s, Dine turned to his wife for new sources of personal iconography. In Braid, with its network of finely etched lines, he transformed her disembodied braid to stand in as her symbolic representation.An early experiment with woodcut technique, The Woodcut Bathrobe illustrates the enduring importance of the bathrobe motif in Dine's work. He first adopted this humble but self-assured motif in 1964 as a metaphor for his self-portrait, after coming across an image of a man's dressing gown in a newspaper advertisement. Dine has used the motif in over seventy printed works.","Pop art (0.963823), Jim Dine (0.790632), Printmaking (0.749481), Happening (0.749099), Claes Oldenburg (0.635489), Pop artists (0.628777), Graphic design (0.553142), Woodcut (0.498586)"

He later became known for paradoxical word-image juxtapositions, as well as large-scale installations simulating museum exhibitions and assemblages made in part with eggshells, mussel shells, and European household goods. He also created paintings, films, performances, and sound pieces. In general, Broodthaers's work focuses on the ways in which social, economic, and institutional constructs influence and affect art's meaning. Broodthaers's printed work consists of twenty-six individual prints, several in diptych format, and some twenty artist's books, mostly created to function as part of his Conceptual projects rather than as explorations of printmaking techniques. The diptych Museum-Museum presents Broodthaers's views on an institution of culture, which, he believes, decontextualizes art. Here identical bars of gold bullion are each stamped with an eagle, a reference to the ""Eagle Department"" in his fictional museum. On the left, they are labeled with artists' names, such as Mantegna, Ingres, and Duchamp, and on the right, with names of commodities such as sugar, tobacco, and chocolate. The bars along the bottom row of each panel carry the following captions: ""IMITATION,"" ""KOPIE,"" ""COPIE,"" ""FALSCH,"" and ""ORIGINAL."" By integrating issues of art and commerce, Broodthaers raises questions concerning the reduction of art objects to basic exchange commodities. Created for one of his mock museum installations, this print implicates museums for their role as treasuries of artistic currency and for their collaboration in the process of commodification as they act as guarantors of aesthetic values.","Art (0.979895), Aesthetics (0.908156), Printmaking (0.716731), Conceptual art (0.580899), Printing (0.580737), Visual arts (0.5392), Marcel Duchamp (0.532007), Modernism (0.444492)"

Polke stenciled this skeletal frame in a series of paintings begun in 1984, varying the imagery around it. Here, he clothes the watchtower in a baleful phosphorescent glow, which sends up a hollow arm to catch the tower's top. In the 1960s Polke had produced what he called ""Capitalist Realism,"" a German variant of Pop art. An element of Pop survives in Watchtower's support, made of commercial yard goods printed, respectively, with a cheerful floral and with a weave or mesh. Refusing consistency, however, Polke combines these with both the sinister tower image and an abstraction (which, with its alternately smooth and spidery lines, suggests more than one painting process). Images and styles from different eras, and associated with different moods and intentions, jostle and layer in the same work—a ""postmodern"" approach that Polke pioneered, and that a variety of artists explored in the 1980s. Visual layering brings a layering of sense. In Watchtower, painted and printed images compete for visibility; if the watchtower is haunted and haunting, the prints connote a banal dailiness.

González-Torres did not pursue this medium for the expressive possibilities inherent in its various techniques but, instead, chose it for its ability to function within his broader conceptual practice. The commercial offset process (photolithography) offered him a vehicle that was easy and inexpensive to produce, and also endlessly replicable. The fact that its surfaces maintained the detached, second-generation appearance of his often grainy photographic sources was a feature that suited his message of ephemerality rather than permanence. Stacks of printed paper, in the form of sculptural objects with Minimalist overtones, constitute a major component of González-Torres's work, which also encompasses such projects as installations of wrapped candy, hanging cords of lightbulbs, and beaded curtains. His printed art extended as well to billboards, give-away booklets, and newspaper inserts, often incorporating his own or found photographs. A gentle, poetic mood emanates from much of this art, suggesting poignant memories or provoking thoughtful consideration of social issues.While González-Torres dealt with gay rights, AIDS, and a variety of governmental abuses in his own work and as a member of the collective Group Material, the subject of ""Untitled"" (Death by Gun), and its treatment, is unusually specific for him.

These words repeat the last line from a poem on the previous page.Á toute épreuve, a monumental project executed over more than a decade, consists of a series of lyrical poems that Éluard had written in the late 1920s, at the time that his wife, Gala, abandoned him for Salvador Dalí. This book about love and the Catalan region of Spain was a collaborative effort involving the artist Miró, the poet Éluard, and the Swiss publisher Cramer. All three had a hand in the imaginative layouts—which interlock text and images—and the choice of paper and typeface.Miró's woodcuts and collagraphs demonstrate the inventiveness of his printmaking. Instead of cutting into a block of wood to create the compositions, Miró arranged his designs—composed of ""found"" scraps of wood—on pieces of plywood. He also bent metal wires into linear elements and then glued these components to a plywood backing before printing.

In 1901 he formed the Phalanx Society in Munich, an art school that sponsored exhibitions and provided a forum for printmaking. Ten years later, he co-founded the Blaue Reiter (Blue Rider) group, which published an important almanac with essays and original prints. His own writings included Concerning the Spiritual in Art, in which he details his artistic philosophy of the psychology of color and the ""inner necessity"" of shapes and compositions, and Point and Line to Plane, which includes a description of the formal and sociological attributes of various print mediums. Although he worked in a Moscow print shop in 1895, Kandinsky did not make his own prints until 1897. Between 1902 and 1904, he completed more than fifty woodcuts, including The Night, Large Version, which is typical of his romantic, fairytale-inspired images of the time. He soon began working on the fifty-six woodcuts for Klänge, which traces the voyage of Saint George and other knights on their search for truth. It contains the artist's own prose poetry and follows the evolution of his artistic style from figuration, inspired by Russian folk culture, to an expressionist abstraction. Kandinsky's version of abstraction continued to develop in Russia under the influences of Suprematism and Constructivism. The result was a new, more rigidly geometric, abstract vocabulary that he took with him to Weimar in 1922, when he went to teach at the Bauhaus, the famed German art school. While there he made works such as Orange, which continued his exploration of lithography, the technique that he felt was the most modern print medium because of its malleability, ease of artistic execution, and ability to create large and uniform editions.","Wassily Kandinsky (0.989861), Expressionism (0.777689), Paul Klee (0.697248), Der Blaue Reiter (0.692687), Bauhaus (0.641615), Munich (0.628732), Printmaking (0.594746), Franz Marc (0.545727)"

Smithson also combined mirrors with heaps of sand, gravel, and other rocks, matching nature's brute rubble with its precise visual twin. (The delicacy of the lacy pink coral is unusual in his work.)

The seven images each correspond to one of the seven spaces in the exhibition. In each of these spaces, Schütte investigated a different field of inquiry, emblematized in the drawings by a lemon, rings, an architectural model, and a portrait of Alain Colas—the French sailor who never returned from his 1978 attempt to cross the Atlantic Ocean alone—among others. That these fields of investigation appear random and disconnected is part of Schütte's message; what drives his art is the notion that images no longer support universal meaning as they once could. Instead of constructing monuments glorifying universal experience, Schütte creates anti-monuments to everyday life and the complexities of human existence—our disappointments as well as our hopes.","Atlantic Ocean (0.983795), Gerhard Richter (0.932146)"

Prior to this, machines were capable of performing hundreds of different basic operations, but most of these operations were rarely used and introduced complications that limited a computer's speed. By reducing the number of different instructions, engineers ensured that each operation would be executed quickly, and although more instructions were needed to perform any given task, net execution time declined. Because instructions were very simple, it became easier to pipeline them—to execute several instructions simultaneously. Moreover, the entire processor could be integrated into a single chip. The result was a dramatic increase in speed and a reduction in cost.Consisting of 172,000 transistors, the C Reduced Instruction Set Processor (CRISP) from AT&T Bell Laboratories exemplifies the handful of RISC processors that revolutionized the architecture of computer processors. In fact, the CRISP model remains the most popular blueprint for the structure of new processors.

A teenager during the Spanish Civil War, he suffered from the isolation and repression of the Franco years but found recognition in the 1950s as part of Art informel, a European movement paralleling Abstract Expressionism in America. Termed ""matter painting,"" his work was noteworthy for thick, furrowed surfaces of sand, varnish, marble dust, and latex. This interest in audacious materials has continued, but Tàpies enriched his visual language in the ensuing decades to also include indications of cryptic writing, everyday objects, and a human presence. Tàpies's involvement with printmaking came at the invitation of several publishers, and he welcomed the new techniques it involved and the relationships he established with master craftsmen in printshops. He immediately sought to challenge the flatness of paper by adding such elements as straw and flocking, by tearing his sheets, and by creating surface indentations with carborundum or embossing. The large-scale Chairs represents the nature of the abstraction, imbued with shifting meanings, that has become his hallmark. Here calligraphic signs are transformed into furniture and then anthropomorphized into communicating protagonists. Tàpies has created some fifteen hundred printed images and also given sustained attention to illustrating books, creating some thirty-five volumes in collaboration with a range of contemporary poets. This is not surprising given the fact that he is an avid reader, essay writer, and committed bibliophile whose library rivals his painting studio as a center of his life. He has said that Anular is among his favorite books. He admires the physicality of its accordion format and the syncopation it creates from the combination of his own signs and symbols, the poetic phrases of author José-Miguel Ullán, and the old Spanish constitution that forms a backdrop.","Lyrical Abstraction (0.914246), Abstract expressionism (0.847258), Spain (0.777815), Art (0.746506), Catalonia (0.726396), Tachisme (0.717645), Sign (0.631854), Expressionism (0.612411)"

However, unlike many Pop artists, he focuses on the autobiographical and emotive connotations of his motifs. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he worked with Claes Oldenburg and Allan Kaprow to organize proto-performance art events known as Happenings. Soon after, drawing on childhood memories of his father's Cincinnati hardware store, Dine began making paintings incorporating real objects like hammers, C-clamps, and paintbrushes. For Dine, these objects functioned ""as a vocabulary of feelings."" An accomplished printmaker, Dine has created almost nine hundred prints to date, many of which have appeared in some twenty illustrated books. Since completing his first prints in 1960 at Pratt Graphic Art Center, he has mastered a wide range of lithographic, intaglio, and woodcut techniques. Dine was among a group of artists whom Tatyana Grosman invited to her legendary printshop, Universal Limited Art Editions, in the early years. He went on to work with many other printers and publishers, including Petersburg Press, Aldo Crommelynck, and Pace Editions. During the 1970s, Dine turned to his wife for new sources of personal iconography. In Braid, with its network of finely etched lines, he transformed her disembodied braid to stand in as her symbolic representation. An early experiment with woodcut technique, The Woodcut Bathrobe illustrates the enduring importance of the bathrobe motif in Dine's work. He first adopted this humble but self-assured motif in 1964 as a metaphor for his self-portrait, after coming across an image of a man's dressing gown in a newspaper advertisement. Dine has used the motif in over seventy printed works.","Pop art (0.963823), Jim Dine (0.790644), Printmaking (0.749503), Happening (0.749102), Claes Oldenburg (0.635493), Pop artists (0.628783), Graphic design (0.553089), Woodcut (0.498596)"

In his studio on Coenties Slip at the tip of Manhattan, Indiana made assemblages of scrap materials and found objects, using stencils to introduce words into his art. By the early 1960s he was creating eye-popping paintings of text, numbers, and symbols that related to the hard-edge abstraction of the day, and included political and social overtones. Later he moved to the island of Vinalhaven off the coast of Maine, where he continues to work. Indiana studied various printmaking techniques at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, but later settled on screenprinting, a medium that suited his simplified forms and electric colors. In addition, the flexible screens could be easily reused to produce serial variations, a common practice in Indiana's printmaking. In all, he has completed more than one hundred sixty prints, working with commercial and fine-art workshops worldwide, among them Edition Domberger, near Stuttgart, known for screenprinting, and Vinalhaven Press, near his home, where he created lithographs and etchings. Few Pop images are more widely recognized than Indiana's LOVE. Originally designed as a Christmas card commissioned by The Museum of Modern Art in 1965, LOVE has appeared in prints, paintings, sculptures, banners, rings, tapestries, and stamps. Full of erotic, religious, autobiographical, and political underpinnings—especially when it was co-opted as an emblem of 1960s idealism—LOVE is both accessible and complex in meaning. In printed works, Indiana has rendered LOVE in a variety of colors, compositions, and techniques. He even translated it into Hebrew for a print and a sculpture at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.","Printmaking (0.96642), Modern art (0.617462), Printing (0.510842), Modernism (0.451734), Abstract expressionism (0.423355), Hard-edge painting (0.414062), Lyrical Abstraction (0.404626), Contemporary art (0.364183)"

Printed work has always played a central role in his art, beginning with commercially produced announcements and ephemera for his Happenings, and continuing with traditional printmaking. Unlike most Pop artists, Oldenburg has been drawn to lithography because of its affinity to drawing rather than to the commercial look of screenprint. He has also produced a significant body of etchings. Engaging various concepts of reproduction and mass-circulation over the course of his career, Oldenburg has created more than two hundred fifty works, designated as ""printed stuff"" by the compilers of his catalogue raisonné. Oldenburg's environment called The Store—a storefront display on New York's Lower East Side, shown from December 1961 to January 1962—epitomized the artist's mingling of art, commodity, and commerce. At The Store, he sold painted plaster-and-wire constructions of familiar foodstuffs, clothing, and merchandise, elevating the status of these objects to art. To advertise his endeavor, Oldenburg created numerous printed works, such as business cards, stationery, and posters, including this hand-colored lithograph. Characterized by both a spontaneity of artistic gesture and the desire to self-promote, this print combines the tendencies of 1950s Abstract Expressionists with art's new embrace of consumer culture. The title of the enterprise, The Store, appears at the top, its address of 107 East 2nd Street at the bottom, and the artist's signature in reverse below the title. Oldenburg's array of objects, including a shirt and tie and a piece of cake, capture the humor and irony of this seminal event in contemporary American art.","Printmaking (0.975747), Pop art (0.691405), Art (0.678918), Modernism (0.64108), Abstract expressionism (0.622859), Lower East Side (0.557876), Sculpture (0.547804), Jim Dine (0.535773)"

Ruff intended that large groups of these approximately eight-by-ten-inch color portraits would be hung together, so to add variety he photographed each person against a colored backdrop.By 1987 Ruff had distilled the project in several ways, settling on an almost exclusive use of the full frontal view, eliminating the colored backdrop in favor of unvarying white, and enlarging the finished work to monumental proportions. Despite the detail that the scrupulous technique and large scale afford, the viewer is left with no insight into the person pictured.

Corinth made these five prints in the last years of his life. Depicting a skeletal figure visiting him, his friends, and his family, the artist personalized the experience of dying. The portfolio exemplifies the highly expressionistic style he developed after having a stroke in 1911.In the opening print, Tod und Künstler (Death and the artist), Death looms over and trains his empty eye sockets on Corinth, who looks up, knowingly, from the print he is etching. On Corinth's wrist, evoking the ceaseless passage of time, is a watch given to him by his beloved wife, Charlotte, who herself appears in Tod und Weib (Death and the woman), cradling Death in her arms. Death looks small and fragile next to Corinth's teenage son in Tod und Jüngling (Death and the youth), unlike the robust figure who casts an ominous shadow over the artist's father in Tod und Greis (Death and the old man). The final print shows the artist Hermann Struck—who had tutored Corinth in printmaking and encouraged him to explore drypoint and the other techniques used in these prints—and his wife, Mally, confronting Death together.","Printmaking (0.972817), Engraving (0.626193), Old master print (0.564663), Intaglio (0.553367), Etching (0.539949), Woodcut (0.47388), London (0.472271), Printing (0.457923)"

Besides being wittily distorted and distended, these shoes are over ten feet high, using a strategy of enlargement prefigured in Claes Oldenburg's Pop sculpture; and Pop art also anticipated Murray's interest in the commonplaces of domestic life, which she paints on an undomestic, even heroic, scale. Murray dramatizes the beautiful ordinariness of familiar objects. ""I paint about the things that surround me,"" she says, ""things that I pick up and handle every day. That's what art is. Art is an epiphany in a coffee cup.""Standing out from the wall in relief, the surface of Dis Pair suggests a stretched and rounded skin—perhaps these curving forms humorously evoke heads and faces, and their visual relationship the relationship of a human couple. The title of the work certainly puns on the slang word ""dis,"" or ""dis-respect,"" and also, more gravely, on ""despair.""

In a drawing by Asplund from 1937, showing the northern part of the site, the entrance to the cemetery is represented by a semicircle on the right side of the drawing. From here, a walled allée marks a strong axial movement to the south, interrupted when it opens to present the visitor with a tranquil rolling landscape devoid of graves. Asplund and Lewerentz studied this entry sequence carefully, establishing it as both monumental and contemplative to communicate the importance of nature, to which all living things ultimately return. As Asplund had in devising the walled and forested precinct around the Woodland Chapel (the rectangular form on the left side of drawing), which is discreetly surrounded by the crematorium and other ancillary buildings, they saved monumentality for the landscape, rather than trying to achieve it through any structure or object. By the time of Asplund's death, in 1940, the architects had transformed their forested site into a modern sanctuary for death and bereavement.

Systems of ordering time based on numbers, musical notations, and calendars have been her principal points of departure. These systems, along with uncensored accounts of her daily activities presented in serial formats, create a coded history in which she conflates the autobiographical with the collective. Sometimes Darboven's cursive lines simply emulate writing, but actually are devoid of syntax and content and represent only a temporal process. She often presents her work in installations of small, identically sized sheets of paper containing this writing. She has also created artist's books that combine these sheets as pages, and a small but significant body of prints, often in portfolio formats that support her serial investigations. Photographs, some taken by the artist and others found, also appear in her work, adding new references and contexts.

The project, for four intersecting and overlapping bridges containing usable space as well as acting as passageways, was intended to foster economic development: in Holl's scheme, community members would earn incomes by working on organized recreational activities housed in the bridges—rowing, ice skating, basketball, boxing, and so on—and these activities would in turn attract visitors and custom to the area. Thus the Gymnasium Bridge would not only serve a physical purpose but act as ""a vehicle from which destitute persons can reenter society."" This drawing shows three views of the bridge: a plan of the upper level of the main span, a plan of the lower level of all four bridges, and an exterior perspective. The plan of the lower level doubles as a site plan and is continuous with the exterior perspective, while the plan of the upper level is isolated at the top of the drawing. The predominance of the site plan reflects Holl's belief that ""architecture and site should have an experiential connection, a metaphysical link, a poetic link."" The darkness of the site contrasts with the luminosity of the structure, casting the bridge as a beacon of hope in the community. This was an early project for Holl. Drawing has always been an important tool in his conception and development of his projects; his renderings, often in watercolor, illustrate his understanding of how the senses perceive architectural spaces. Phenomenology has made appearances in Holl's writings, and as a result of his focus on the human relationship to architecture, his practice is often linked to this philosophical study of reality as it is understood and experienced by the human consciousness.","Perception (0.976868), Technical drawing (0.788176), Sense (0.682096), Phenomenology (0.666211), Architecture (0.636851), Mind (0.595456), Poverty (0.592446), Bridge (0.578277)"

Its relatively small scale and standard program allowed and even inspired architects to experiment with architectural components such as material and spatial articulation, even while retaining the original function as shelter. Paul Rudolph's exploration of the house began when he was a student at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design. Following the teaching of Walter Gropius, Rudolph followed the formal and structural principles of the International Style, which included clarity, a strict adherence to function, and an unambiguous expression of individual parts. These guiding principles are instrumental in his design of the Finney Guest House, an unbuilt project in South Florida. He began studies for the house in 1947, while he was still a student, then continuued to work on it until around 1949. In this impeccably rendered drawing, Rudolph clearly communicates not only his design ideas for the guest house but also the reason for the drawing itself, which is ""always to inform the act of building"". Choosing wood and glass as his primary material palette, Rudolph carefully arranges rectangular roof and floor planes into a spatial composition suspended above the water and surrounding landscape. The glazed walls, penetrated by indirect and filtered light, would almost allow one to feel that one was in the landscape rather than indoors, a quality in which they recall other glass houses designed several years earlier by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson. Rudolph later came to find International Style dicta wanting, feeling that they did not fully consider the psychological aspect of space—how individuals use and inhabit it. The function of a space, he would argue, varies with each person, so that his buildings became ""perpetual statements on the nature of architecture""—for him, “a continuing, ever-integrating, altering, deepening enigma.”","Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (0.971685), Bauhaus (0.539214), Modern architecture (0.339974), Le Corbusier (0.33799), House (0.324067), Walter Gropius (0.318972), Architecture (0.310079), Germany (0.260407)"

MGM screenwriters labored to create a plot until Arthur Freed, the head of MGM's famed musical production unit, decided the film should be a vehicle for former child star Judy Garland. In the film, Garland plays Esther, a daughter in the Smith family of St. Louis, who sings her way through the seasons from summer 1903 to spring 1904, as the city prepares for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Among her many tunes, Esther sings ""The Trolley Song,"" discovering the clang, clang, clang of her heartbeat because she is in love. Minnelli highlighted the simplicity and naturalness of her acting and singing, which captivated audiences.Following his success in the 1930s as a director and designer for the Broadway theater, Minnelli moved on to Hollywood as a member of Freed's unit at MGM, bringing to this popular genre a fresh approach. Whereas others were reluctant to use Technicolor, Minnelli understood and embraced the new process, showing off the dazzling brightness of its colors. He became one of Hollywood's most accomplished colorists and a master of cinematic musical comedy. Minnelli set a new standard for the genre, smoothly inserting dance numbers into the narrative in a blend of naturalism and fantasy, as realistic characters discover and declare their hopes, fears, or loves.

By then he had abandoned the painterly conventions he found alienating and was making canvases using photographs and texts. Works like I Will Not Make Any More Boring Art, his first print, demonstrate his thinking at the time and his developing interest in Conceptual art. Created at Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in conjunction with an unconventional exhibition, it depicts a sentence that Baldessari instructed students to write on the gallery walls ""like punishment."" He was not present at the ""exhibition,"" nor at the workshop where the print was made. He simply sent a handwritten page to be reproduced and made a videotape of himself writing the sentence. Such activities were typical of this school's experimental program in the 1970s. Its lithography workshop, in particular, served to broaden the scope of printmaking by inviting artists like Baldessari, Vito Acconci, Dennis Oppenheim, and others to explore its potential for Conceptual art projects. Baldessari has gone on to make about ninety prints, primarily in his signature photo-collage style. An example of his collages, made from stills of old B-movies superimposed with geometric shapes, is seen in an illustration for a special edition of Tristram Shandy. This spread is part of an accordion-folded volume of his illustrations commissioned by Andrew Hoyem of The Arion Press. When Hoyem learned of Baldessari's interest in Laurence Sterne's novel of 1760, he invited him to participate in a new publication that matches Sterne's disregard for plot and punctuation with the artist's own disjointed imagery.

Not dedicated solely to sculpture, Smith was a devoted painter, draftsman, and printmaker, and he saw these practices as integral to his art-making process. Throughout his career, his works on paper served a multiplicity of roles: as preparatory drawings, sketches after existing sculptures, independent compositions, and exercises to keep his artistic skills honed. He used printmaking as another form of drawing, which he once referred to as the ""life force of the painter."" Although he made thirty-six printed compositions, in many instances only one or two impressions of each exist. Smith arrived in New York in 1926 and enrolled in classes at the Art Students League. He began making prints soon after, creating linoleum cuts of street scenes and landscapes. His exposure to African sculpture and to the art of the European avant-garde had an impact on his work, as seen in a series of Surrealist-inspired etchings of the 1940s. In 1952 Smith made his first lithographs. A natural fit, lithography allowed him to work in a comfortable and familiar fashion by using a brush to paint on the stone as he would on a sheet of paper. Six lithographs made at this time bear the closest affinity to Smith's drawings, and he signed them as he did his contemporary drawings, with the date and Greek version of his initials visible at the top left center of this work. In this print, Smith created the sense of a correspondence letter whose contents are just out of reach, written in a hieroglyphic or pictographic language that combines the suggestive abstract and non-specific figurative aspects of his sculpture.","Printmaking (0.974916), Sculpture (0.833074), Abstract expressionism (0.790301), Printing (0.707373), David Smith (0.605091), Linocut (0.537589), Modernism (0.537177), Lithography (0.535599)"

When the Wall came down a few years later, Germans on both sides discovered that the rift Schmidt had evoked still divided them.","West Germany (0.989832), Germany (0.977544), Cold War (0.95261), World War II (0.939217), East Germany (0.930956), West Berlin (0.906974), Berlin Wall (0.885571), East Berlin (0.809741)"

In 1956 he emigrated to West Berlin, where the dominant style was tachisme, a form of painterly abstraction that corresponded to late Abstract Expressionism in America. Baselitz rejected that style as decorative and instead evolved a vocabulary of disturbing figurative imagery that caused a scandal when it was exhibited. Eventually the figures in his paintings were depicted as fragmenting apart and soon thereafter were turned upside-down in what has become his hallmark. Baselitz's early experiences with printmaking began at a municipal workshop for artists in West Berlin. He started with etching and soon turned to woodcut. During a stay in Italy in the mid-1960s, he discovered sixteenth-century Mannerist prints and began a personal collection that is now well known. He also tried the tonal ""chiaroscuro"" woodcut technique prevalent in that early period. Having made nearly one thousand prints in the course of his career, Baselitz stands out for his direct engagement with technical processes. He has described the resistance of copperplates, woodblocks, and linoleum blocks as creative forces in his art and has referred to prints as having ""symbolic power which has nothing to do with a painting."" He is also known for distinctive printed surfaces created with oil paint rather than printer's ink. Woman on the Beach and Nude with Three Arms are examples, and these prints garnered much attention during the Neo-Expressionist movement of the late 1970s and 1980s, when linoleum cut and woodcut had a great resurgence. Baselitz's wife, Elke, often assists him with printing, using a press in his studio, although he also works with master printers.Originally from TextEntryID 69400 (TextTypeID 127)removed text, here seen in an untitled example depicting a fragmented woodsman, one of the figure types he presented as modern heroes","Linocut (0.956853), Woodcut (0.884161), Printmaking (0.729167), Neo-expressionism (0.709224), Lyrical Abstraction (0.687558), Printing (0.686025), Painting (0.645459), Abstract art (0.631613)"

As a sculptor and printmaker, she blends figurative and abstract traditions with social concerns, and has maintained a deep belief in the democratic power of printed art to reach a large audience. She has completed some eighty prints in woodcut, screenprint, lithography, and, most importantly, linoleum cut, a technique she learned at El Taller de Gráfica Popular (People's Graphic Workshop). This renowned workshop and artists' collective was first visited by Catlett while she was in Mexico City on a fellowship in 1946. The workshop's aim is to continue the Mexican tradition of socially engaged public art. It specializes in linoleum cut, as it is a technique that is easy to work with, produces inexpensive prints, and can accommodate large editions. Catlett's attraction to Mexican printmaking reflects a social and political concern she shares with the great muralists. Like them she uses her art to advance causes of particular interest to her, including the African-American experience and the plight of the lower classes. Many of her prints show the multidimensional aspects of women as mothers, workers, and activists. Sharecropper evokes Catlett's belief in the strength and dignity of the working poor, while it also offers a heroic portrait of this anonymous woman. She also depicts great women from African-American history, including Harriet Tubman, who is shown leading slaves to freedom as a ""conductor"" on the Underground Railroad. Catlett's continued support of the civil rights movement in the United States during the 1960s is visible in the print completed after Malcolm X was shot and killed. It expresses Catlett's enthusiasm for the leader's successful efforts in inspiring pride in African-American women.","Printmaking (0.976345), Harriet Tubman (0.664327), Slavery in the United States (0.556608), Printing (0.547626), Underground Railroad (0.544622), African American (0.505963), United States (0.423731), Linocut (0.419388)"

After first constructing miniature houses, chairs, and other objects in the 1970s, he began making his signature large-scale sculptures in wood and bronze in the early 1980s. Shapiro's first prints were etched fingerprints, made in 1970 at the New York Graphic Workshop. He has worked intermittently in printmaking ever since, completing more than fifty editions in collaboration with several New York publishers, who encouraged him to try his hand at the different techniques available at various local workshops. Among others, these include lithographs at Derrière L'Étoile Studios, screenprints at Simca Print Artists, aquatints with Aldo Crommelynck, and etchings with Maurice Payne. Shapiro first explored the woodcut technique in 1985 at Universal Limited Art Editions, where he used printing blocks that were not carved but rather assembled using fragments taken from a dollhouse. The work shown here is one of several woodcuts that Shapiro subsequently produced at The Grenfell Press. Devoid of the expressionist style and content most commonly associated with woodcuts, it demonstrates the flexibility of the technique to embrace different artistic approaches. Created from three separate blocks cut into simple rectangular shapes, this print emphasizes contrasting grains of different wood veneers. By retaining the scalloped edges that were left after the shapes were gouged from larger blocks, Shapiro underscores the literal presence of these sculpturelike elements and leaves a tangible reminder of his physical process. He also brings a sculptor's instinctive feel for spatial relationships to the final composition, in which the slightly skewed blocks seem to shift forward and backward within the generous margins of the paper.","Printmaking (0.966468), Woodcut (0.59083), Etching (0.510586), Printing (0.434557), Woodblock printing (0.409404), Old master print (0.378573), Wood (0.319263), Intaglio (0.314595)"

Using unconventional, often found materials, he has created projects that include pyramids of human hair collected from the floors of Harlem barbershops and snowballs that he sells on the sidewalk. His drawings, made from Harlem dirt bounced off a basketball onto paper, could conceptually be termed ""prints."" Hammon's statement from the 1960s, ""I feel it my moral obligation as a black artist to try to graphically document what I feel socially,"" continues to illuminate his work. An artist who came of age during the height of the civil rights and black nationalist movements, Hammons established his reputation during this period with his series of some five hundred politically charged body prints. Here the artist's body, sometimes clothed, sometimes naked, was smeared with grease and functioned as a printing plate when he pressed himself against a sheet of paper. He then sprinkled dry pigments onto the greasy markings, sometimes adding other imagery in screenprint. Through this reconceptualization of printmaking, a medium steeped in tradition, the artist created his own representations of the black male body. Other printed works he has made over the years have been equally atypical. With his stencil Free Nelson Mandela, Hammons once again utilized a printmaking technique in a kind of performance addressing social and political concerns. Spray-painted on both indoor and outdoor sites while Mandela was still in prison after more than twenty years, the stencil was then sprayed on torn billboard papers to create this print. Its subject is a concrete signifier of what was denied by authorities, but was indeed true for many black South Africans-that the spirit of Mandela remained and that his cause could not be extinguished.","Printing (0.961308), Printmaking (0.829825), Nelson Mandela (0.691772)"

The front facade of Venturi's design, for example, has the elements of a conventional house: large gable, chimney, front door, and windows. Yet throughout the building, the adept juxtaposition of big and little elements and the intentional distortion of symmetry establish a richness of meaning and perceptual ambiguity that make the Vanna Venturi residence one of the most important houses of the second half of the twentieth century.The design for the house coincided in 1961–62 with Venturi's writing of Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture (published by The Museum of Modern Art in 1966). This brilliant architectural critique, supported by numerous illustrations of historical buildings, sought to overturn the limitations and reductive simplicity of orthodox modern architecture. Describing his own mannerist inclusive sensibility as ""both–and,"" as opposed to ""either–or,"" he wrote: ""If the source of the both–and phenomenon is contradiction, its basis is hierarchy, which yields several levels of meanings among elements with varying values. It can include elements that are both good and awkward, big and little, closed and open, continuous and articulated, round and square, structural and spatial. An architecture which includes varying levels of meaning breeds ambiguity and tension.""

The required stones, plates, and screens, as well as the proofing process itself, have served to facilitate his use and reuse of imagery in new contexts. Such alterations and metamorphosis have allowed Johns to continually forge new meanings for his evolving artistic vocabulary, not only in printmaking but also in painting and drawing, mediums that, for him, are all deeply intertwined. Johns is of the generation that led to a renaissance of printmaking in America, and he has worked at several printshops that were established in this period. Having created some four hundred printed works in the course of his career, in addition to countless working proofs and evolving states, he carefully organizes this body of work in a personal archive that documents his creative process. The technique of lithography is primary for him, but he has also worked extensively in etching and other intaglio processes. In addition, sustained periods of screenprint and monotype activity have led to substantial achievements. Currently, he has his own press, making printmaking easier and more convenient. From early images like Target and Ale Cans, to enigmatic abstractions and collagelike figurative compositions, Johns has forged an individualized style that is difficult to categorize among the movements of contemporary art. His early placement in a transitional period between Abstract Expressionism and Pop art lost significance as his work unfolded. Yet an underlying emotional and intellectual resonance has remained constant throughout. His probing imagery invites introspection in almost poetic terms of reference, suggestion, and allegory.

Trained as a painter, Nauman gave up this traditional practice for a plethora of mediums, including sculpture in rubber, steel, fiberglass, and neon, architectural installations, video, photography, and performance. Also important in Nauman's oeuvre has been body art, a movement originating in the 1960s and 1970s in which the artist's own body, rather than traditional materials such as paint or wood, was the medium of choice. Although the conventional techniques of printmaking would not seem a natural choice for Nauman, he began to work at Cirrus Editions in Los Angeles, a print workshop and gallery opened by Tamarind-trained printer Jean Milant, in 1970. There he experimented with lithography and intaglio mediums, often using unconventional implements such as carpenter's files in lieu of traditional tools. Since that time, printmaking has remained a constant aspect of his creative output. Although Nauman's first editions derived from his body art, much of his subsequent printed work has dealt with language. Language is among his most important subjects, explored in many mediums. He dissects and deconstructs words and phrases, reverses them, reassembles them, plays with them, depicts them, and recombines them as part of an ongoing conceptual practice.

His work also includes such subjects as bestiaries, lyrical landscapes, and illustrations for children's stories and other literary works. Fascinated by the political prints of Mexican artist JosT Guadalupe Posada, Frasconi began his seven-decade career as a satirical cartoonist. Raised in Uruguay, he has lived in the United States since 1945, when he received a scholarship from the Art Students League in New York. An admirer of German Expressionist and Japanese woodcuts, he did much to sustain interest in the medium at mid-century and, of the three thousand prints he has made, most were executed using this technique. For his books, numbering more than one hundred, Frasconi makes full use of page sequencing to create visual narratives into which he often incorporates fragments of text with fonts he has designed himself. An indefatigable craftsman, he does his own printing, but has also reproduced some books photomechanically so they can be distributed more broadly through inexpensive trade editions. Viet Nam! alternates woodcuts of war-torn victims with relief halftone prints of sleek B52 bombers, both based on newspaper photographs. The interleaving of white, red, black, and translucent papers, sometimes left blank or repeating previous pages, creates a cinematic rhythm. In Los Desaparecidos, Frasconi pays homage to citizens of Latin America who, because of their suspected dissent, ""disappeared"" during the period of military dictatorships there. Here he exploits the raw immediacy of wood grain and experiments with scale to achieve powerfully confrontational effects. Political themes, like those explored here, have been a passion for Frasconi. He even taught a course in the use of art as social statement during his long tenure as a professor at the State University of New York at Purchase.","United States (0.984395), Woodcut (0.878496), Forced disappearance (0.76271), Printmaking (0.761667), Wood (0.705845), Literature (0.641802), Art (0.627852), Latin America (0.622858)"

Her artistic abilities had always been encouraged and, at an early age, she took art classes at the local museum in Buffalo, New York. She later studied sculpture and painting at Cornell University. Moving to New York City in 1969, Rothenberg became part of SoHo's community of artists, and occasionally worked as a part-time performer in productions by artist Joan Jonas. In 1973 she began making paintings of a single horse, a form that would occupy her for the next several years and become an early hallmark of her work. Progressively, she began to disassemble the horse image, depicting only parts of its anatomy. She eventually shifted her focus to disembodied aspects of the human figure. With loosely depicted forms floating unanchored on dark grounds, her work continues to navigate between figuration and abstraction, and she remains a creator of mysterious and ambiguous images.Rothenberg pursued similar concerns in printmaking, an activity she began in the late 1970s. Since that time, she has made approximately seventy prints, including lithographs, screenprints, woodcuts, and intaglios. She feels most comfortable working in a reductive way, erasing and scraping to create an image from a black ground. Mezzotint, the intaglio technique used in Boneman, is particularly suited to this method of working. Although she occasionally opts for color, her work is most often executed in a palette of black, white, and gray. In Boneman, a mysterious drumming figure seems to emerge from a dreamlike darkness. Color is provided only by her choice of a wood veneer paper on which she has printed this monochromatic image.","Printmaking (0.952091), New York City (0.604366), Painting (0.565269), Wood (0.564227), New York (0.491168), Intaglio (0.488473), Cornell University (0.455947), Horse (0.441874)"

In 1984, at the age of sixty–four, he hit upon what would be his exclusive subject for the rest of his life—his own naked body. Over the course of twenty years, Coplans published some twenty books of photographs of his body, including volumes devoted to pictures of his feet and his hands. None of them shows his head.Before he made his photographs, Coplans used a video camera operated by an assistant to record various poses to see if they were what he wanted. In designing his poses he drew on his long and varied life experience (in addition to his work in the arts, he fought in World War II) and especially on his extensive knowledge of the history of art. This included painting, sculpture, and photography, from ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman art to blunt twentieth–century photographs by Weegee, plus a full awareness of contemporary abstract art and performance art. Although the masculinity of Coplans's pictures continues to be somewhat shocking (it is the naked female form that dominates the history of visual art), it is their depiction of his aged body that is most provocative. In this photograph he balances on one foot, a strong yet vulnerable figure in an ersatz frieze.","Photography (0.949472), Art (0.776833), History of painting (0.708656), World War II (0.686598), Camera (0.623339), Music (0.575199), Arts (0.54897), History of art (0.545709)"

As a young artist, he became known for his reductive Minimalist paintings, executed in series that emphasized a single theme to which each painting presented a different solution or response. In 1967 he accepted master printer Kenneth Tyler's invitation to make prints at the Gemini G.E.L. workshop. There he continued the serial spare geometry of his paintings, often basing his prints on those paintings, while confronting a new set of challenges in terms of scale, ink, and paper choice. Stella's prints also afforded him the opportunity to rework certain concepts, as in the 1973 Double Gray Scramble, part of a brief but fruitful foray into screenprint, which combined earlier images of concentric squares in either gray tones or color values. In this work he alternates between color and gray, ""scrambling"" the squares of the earlier projects. Of Stella's more than two hundred fifty print projects to date, approximately one hundred fifty of them have been collaborations with Tyler at Gemini and later at Tyler Graphics, resulting in what has been called ""one of the great partnerships in modern American art."" Tyler's technical virtuosity and penchant for experimentation have made him the ideal partner for Stella, whose style has now evolved into a riot of color, baroque gesture, and three-dimensionality. Through complex, ambitious printing processes, specially formulated inks, and hand-dyed papers, Tyler and Stella have successfully translated the energy of his painted metal reliefs into several series of prints. Circuits, one such series, is based on the artist's long-standing interest in car racing, and each print, including Pergusa Three, is named for an international racetrack.","Printing (0.988496), Minimalism (0.736717), Printmaking (0.621147), Modernism (0.577114), Painting (0.563224), Shaped canvas (0.54983), Integers (0.522263), Paper (0.513036)"

To look one-sidedly at the idea of fantasy and not to consider its positive role in all fields of culture and art-this is to make a great mistake."" For Chernikov the fantasy drawing offered the architect an effective means of liberating himself from convention and imagining a future reflecting the avant-garde culture of the new Soviet Union. As a Constructivist, and like contemporaries such as Kasimir Malevich and El Lissitzky, Chernikov was possessed by the powers of abstraction and geometry. This is reflected in the phrase Combination of curvilinear and rectilinear forms along principles of design, the rather perfunctory subtitle for Complex Architectural Invention (composition no. 49 from Architectural Fantasies): this is a formal composition based on line (curved or straight), plane, surface, body, and volume. The excitement and brilliance of Chernikov's fantasy lie in his dynamic handling of diagonal lines, ellipses, and bright colors, presented in a dizzying axonometric view. The imagery, unabashedly industrial in character yet devoid of any context or program, is remarkably fresh and pregnant with possibility. In producing his Architectural Fantasies Chernikov was interested not only in self-discovery but in inspiring his viewers. The seeds of his fantasies, however, never had a chance to germinate in the Soviet Union: Stalin's repressive regime, which effectively put an end to Constructivism in the 1930s, favored a banal architecture based on monumental classicism and Social Realism. The potential of Architectural Fantasies lay dormant until Chernikov and other Constructivist architects were ""rediscovered"" in the 1980s, inspiring a new generation of architects worldwide in a movement that was labeled ""deconstructivist.""","Russia (0.983188), Soviet Union (0.815762), Kazimir Malevich (0.779047), Constructivism (0.707427), El Lissitzky (0.706056), Moscow (0.669284), Russian avant-garde (0.660175), Architect (0.629451)"

Le Corbusier visited South America in 1929, a memorable trip that allowed him to survey the tropical landscapes and cityscapes from the air at leisure, with the help of the aviators Jean Mermoz and Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. The uniqueness of the landscape, and the contrast between the forest and open terrain and the sprawling, suffocating cities, inspired him to draw up new plans for Montevideo and São Paulo. The sketch for Montevideo, at the top of the drawing, highlights a giant business center under a motorway that juts into the bay, connecting the most important buildings and bypassing the preexisting urban chaos. The plan for São Paulo, below, attempts to dodge the city's traffic by setting a cruciform arrangement of motorways on the roofs of residential apartment blocks. Making powerful strokes and cuts through the landscape, Le Corbusier envisions superimposing buildings and freeways on a giant scale over the existing urban fabric. Instead of a center, the new city would have satellites and zones, all with their own infrastructural systems. ""I prefer drawing to talking. Drawing is faster, and allows less room for lies"", Le Corbusier remarked in 1961. These sketches testify to the strength of his ideas' flow onto the paper.","Le Corbusier (0.963088), Urban planning (0.933667), So Paulo (0.794602), Ville Contemporaine (0.713912), City (0.689667), Highway (0.663863), Landscape (0.578544), Motorway (0.577764)"

""This movement is provided by relationships of uneven measures, by color contrasts, which constitute Reality.""

The Benday dots and regularized stripes he used for tone, the clarifying black outlines, the flat areas of bold primary color, and the simplification and schematization of his compositions are all elements embraced by consumer culture to create the inescapable printed imagery aimed at mass audiences. The subject matter that first brought Lichtenstein's work to public attention was appropriated from comic strips, but his later themes owed their visual syntax to themes from ""high"" culture, particularly the history of modern art...like German Expressionism and Art Deco, as well as the time-honored motif of landscape in art. In every case, his sense of irony is coupled with a strikingly positive spirit. Printmaking was integral to Lichtenstein's practice from the time he was a student, and in the early 1950s he regularly entered regional print exhibitions. But it was his Pop style that attracted the professional workshops established in the 1960s, and his work was instrumental in the renaissance of American printmaking at that time. His mechanized aesthetic was particularly in keeping with the technical expertise offered at Gemini G.E.L., and his early collaborations there were undertaken with Kenneth Tyler, a printer he continued to work with at Tyler Graphics. Donald Saff, then of Graphicstudio, was another technical wizard who urged Lichtenstein to make prints. In all he created some three hundred fifty printed images, primarily with a series format that echoed his work in painting. In addition to traditional prints, he created ephemeral projects in the spirit of Pop art, like wallpaper, gift wrap, and paper plates, and also made many benefit prints and posters for social and political causes.","Roy Lichtenstein (0.979835), Printing (0.935857), Pop art (0.930453), United States (0.806288), Andy Warhol (0.667301), Modern art (0.63111), Printmaking (0.591942), Modernism (0.559307)"

In addition to flat planes and rectilinear configurations, Elementarism employed inclined planes and relief to activate compositions. Van Doesburg's schemes for the interior walls of Café Aubette were based on a grid of predominantly gray planes, with vibrant panels in primary colors. Plaster was used to form a relief pattern between panels.

Rock is interpreted as a religion with the potential for communal transcendental experience, but one that inverts traditional pieties with sexualized religious dance.

The artist made his first such prints in 1919, eventually completing at least sixty-four, in addition to eight woodcuts. Although other artists had experimented with the technique, linoleum cut was not commonly thought of as a fine art medium in the early twentieth century. Flight, however, saw in it the potential for a truly democratic art form: the materials and tools necessary were inexpensive, and printing could be done by hand. His hope was that linoleum cuts would become a part of everyday culture, available at reasonable prices to even the working class, and part of a lending collection at the local library. His efforts in support of the medium were exhaustive: he wrote textbooks on the subject; organized annual traveling exhibitions; and edited the magazine Arts and Crafts Quarterly. Most importantly, he taught at London's Grosvenor School of Art, where  he imparted to his students his love and knowledge of the medium, guaranteeing generations of practitioners. Flight was influenced by Italian Futurism's wholehearted embrace of the speed and dynamism of the new machine age, and the abstracted visual style of the short-lived British movement called Vorticism, which flourished between 1914 and 1917. He developed a signature abstracted Vorticist style, full of rhythmic lines and geometric forms, that is visible in Summer, part of a cycle depicting the four seasons, and in Paris Omnibus. Both demonstrate his fascination with and appreciation for modern technology and the urban experience. In the latter, a departing bus deposits two passengers visible at the lower right, in a scene that captures what he referred to as ""an expression of the busy life around us.""","Art (0.982909), Visual arts (0.519822), 20th century (0.509696), Medium (0.485659), Fine art (0.446107), Arts (0.435987), Aesthetics (0.417927), Film (0.410012)"

These works—begun in 1943 when his studio was near a Nazi prison camp outside of Paris and he reputedly heard the cries of its victims—depict anonymous, abstracted heads, limbless torsos, and disembodied hands. With their crude, encrusted surfaces, built up through the use of a plasterlike paper pulp, the paintings were interpreted as emblems of the violence and decay of the Holocaust and also as a call to moral action in resistance. Their quasi-abstract, gestural nature also helped usher in a new movement known as Art informel (formless art), a European counterpart to Abstract Expressionism in the late 1940s and 1950s. Fautrier valued the democratic potential of printmaking and created nearly three hundred prints during his lifetime—roughly half lithographs and half intaglio prints, as well as a handful of woodcuts. Many were produced for illustrated book projects in collaboration with leading French writers who championed his work. His subjects included hostage imagery, erotic nudes, and abstracted plant forms. In the etching shown here he approximated the rough, textured surfaces of his Hostage paintings by using the etching needle to scar and pit his plate. Although most of Fautrier's prints were executed during the 1940s, they were often not editioned until after 1958, when he entered into a contract with publisher Michel Couturier to make new impressions of old plates. Prior to authorizing these comparatively traditional editions, Fautrier devoted much of the decade from 1946 to 1956 to an experimental series of ""multiple originals,"" in which prints on paper were overworked with gouache, pastel, and paper pulp and mounted on canvas.

Her art, she has said, ""is about what is known forever in the mind""—perfection, the transcendent reality spoken of in Eastern religions. For her, the grid evokes not a human measure but a supernal one, a boundless order.Like many Abstract Expressionist artists (her chronological contemporaries), Martin honors the spiritual potential of art, but none of those painters approached the spiritual through symmetry. The organization of Friendship shares more with the Minimal art of a later generation, but the lines Martin has hand-scored into that shimmering plane of gold have a unique delicacy. From a distance, too, they fade, structuring the field almost subliminally. The result is a sense of an infinite space with a mysterious vitality.

Asplund's early sketch of the Woodland Chapel, which he was directly commissioned to design, reflects the influence of Swedish Romanticism. His proposal—""a synthesis of temple and hut,"" according to the architectural historian Caroline Constant—was directly inspired by a vernacular cottage in Liselund, Denmark, which he visited on his honeymoon in 1918. The chapel is set in a pine forest. A path leads through the wood to the entrance, where the dominant form is a steeply pitched shingle roof, a massive shape like a truncated pyramid supported by columns. The deep portico continues the darkness of the forest. Only when the doors to the chapel are open is the visitor presented with a light-filled interior. This preliminary sketch has a childlike quality, but nevertheless captures the essence of the building's strong geometric forms.

For Meier, drawings are a means to an end. He produces them not for aesthetic purposes—he finds little value in drawing and coloring beautiful facades—but as part of his process of exploring the building's fundamental design, in plan, section, and elevation. Meier's spare graphite line on tracing paper seems fitting to the composition of reductive elements in his all-white building. Yet his economy of line utterly belies the spatial complexity and the drama of light and shadow experienced by the building's visitors. The historical inspiration underlying much of Meier's work is the early architecture of Le Corbusier, such as the Villa Savoye, an icon of the modern movement. Meier's homage lies in part in his formal vocabulary, with its pilotis, ramps, and pure white forms, but also in his emphasis on the architectural promenade, that is, the journey through the building. Meier has said of the Atheneum that ""circulation is the main spatial protagonist of this building and the ramp is its most vital element."" This is evident in both of these preliminary studies, which were first exhibited at The Museum of Modern Art in an exhibition devoted to the Atheneum in 1985. In the plan, the building's principal cross axes can be seen extending beyond it into the landscape, as if connecting metaphorically with the grid of the town to welcome visitors. By rotating one axis slightly off center, Meier creates a dynamic tension that is reinforced by the shifting directions of the path threading through a variety of spaces connected by ramps and stairs. The complexity of these spaces is echoed in the irregular outline of the facade, notably the curved and fluid wall oriented toward the nearby river. The elevation brings the promenade to life by charting its trajectory through the horizontal levels of the building: ramp, stairs, bridges, and balconies activate the overall composition in a careful study of rectangles and grids, planarity and transparency. The drawing conveys a sense of anticipation and excitement, suggesting how this spatially complex building invites exploration and discovery, for the exhibits in the galleries, for the rooftop balcony from which to view the historic town, and for its own intricate sake, as a fitting symbol of the town founders' pioneering spirit.","Le Corbusier (0.958446), Modernism (0.648055), Modern art (0.55191), New Harmony, Indiana (0.536549), Architecture (0.516492), Villa Savoye (0.488395), Piloti (0.488253), Utopia (0.482115)"

Although his earliest paintings of landscapes and figures are in a traditional style, Judd soon began to work in an abstract mode, and shortly thereafter turned to sculpture. Between 1964 and 1966, he and other artists of his generation developed the vocabulary of Minimalism. His simple forms included boxes made of wood, metal, or industrial plastic placed directly on the floor rather than on bases or pedestals. Of particular interest to Judd was the idea of seriality, embodied in his work by progressions or repetition of standard units, and epitomized by his ""stacks,"" groups of wall-mounted boxes forming columns of alternating solids and voids of equal size. Seriality was also present in Judd's work as a printmaker, which began with figurative lithographs in 1951 and eventually grew to include approximately three hundred editions, many of them woodcuts, the most sculptural of all print mediums. In 1961 Judd began a woodcut series depicting variations on a single form, the parallelogram. Over the next eight years, the series of twenty-six prints came together in a variety of ways. Some began as wall sculptures made of unfinished lumber that Judd later decided to ink and print, essentially creating a two-dimensional manifestation of a three-dimensional sculpture. Others, including this Untitled work, were specifically designed as prints, with wood matrices carved according to Judd's design by his father, Roy C. Judd, who served as the printer for this project. After they were printed, these woodblocks were considered sculptural objects. Another series was created by printing twelve of the blocks in cerulean blue. Judd returned to the paralellogram form repeatedly, making similar serial explorations in etching and aquatint.","Printmaking (0.960072), Sculpture (0.736062), Donald Judd (0.622896), Printing (0.548633), Minimalism (0.484673), Woodcut (0.464545), Etching (0.440486), Old master print (0.385809)"

His work incorporates a broad range of cultural influences, including Eastern and Western religions, philosophy, art, mythology, and astrology, and his paintings, pastels, watercolors, and prints reflect this inclusive spirit. Tondo, for example, combines the circular format popular in the Italian Renaissance with a dreamlike composition of sensual nudes and mystical circular forms reminiscent of waxing and waning suns and moons. Emerging on the New York art scene in the 1980s, Clemente was recognized as part of the new generation of figurative painters labeled Neo-Expressionists, and the peripatetic Italian painters known as the Transavanguardia. Clemente befriended members of New York's burgeoning graffiti and hip-hop scenes, as well as visual artists such as Andy Warhol, and musicians and literati. Such relationships have proven to be an important complement to Clemente's wholehearted embrace of collaboration, which has included work with Indian miniaturists and sign painters, monastic papermakers, authors and poets with whom he has made numerous book projects, and master printers with whom he makes prints. In the 1980s one such collaboration with Japanese master printer Tadashi Toda of the Shi-un-do Print Shop in Kyoto led to the creation of several virtuoso woodcut self-portraits, one of Clemente's most prevalent subjects. Executed after existing watercolors, these woodcuts were done in the traditional ukiyo-e manner, with the artist collaborating with both a woodblock carver and a master printer to achieve complicated, full-color, multiblock prints. First invited to make prints by Kathan Brown of Crown Point Press in 1980, Clemente has created more than one hundred prints to date in mediums including woodcut, etching, and aquatint.

Woodcut, the only printmaking technique Kiefer uses, has played a central role in his work. However, rather than creating conventional prints published in standard editions, he incorporates woodcuts into paintings, groups them together to create works that rival the grand scale of his paintings, or uses them in his many illustrated books. To date he has completed approximately one hundred works incorporating the woodcut technique. In 1970 Kiefer began to study with Joseph Beuys at the Academy of Art in Düsseldorf, where, under Beuys's influence, he embarked on a personal examination of the troubled legacy of Germany's past. He incorporated a wide range of diverse materials into his work, including photographs, straw, tar, lead, sand, and dried plants, as well as woodcut, a technique with a long and distinguished history in German art. Richard Wagner's opera cycle The Ring and the tragic fate of its protagonists Siegfried and Brunhilde form the backdrop for Grane. The heroic role of Brunhilde's horse, Grane, is a recurring motif in Kiefer's work. Here the horse is engulfed in the funeral pyre into which the heroine rides at a climactic moment in the opera. Kiefer's book Der Rhein can be seen as his response to the German tradition of landscape painters such as Caspar David Friedrich and others of the Romantic period. It epitomizes his use of the book format as an evocative metaphor for the communication of collective knowledge and memory.","Anselm Kiefer (0.968465), Painting (0.923426), Printmaking (0.893937), Caspar David Friedrich (0.863409), Richard Wagner (0.752283), Joseph Beuys (0.670928), Romanticism (0.652069), Landscape art (0.644839)"

In 1956 he emigrated to West Berlin, where the dominant style was tachisme, a form of painterly abstraction that corresponded to late Abstract Expressionism in America. Baselitz rejected that style as decorative and instead evolved a vocabulary of disturbing figurative imagery that caused a scandal when it was exhibited. Eventually the figures in his paintings were depicted as fragmenting apart and soon thereafter were turned upside-down in what has become his hallmark.Baselitz's early experiences with printmaking began at a municipal workshop for artists in West Berlin. He started with etching and soon turned to woodcut. During a stay in Italy in the mid-1960s, he discovered sixteenth-century Mannerist prints and began a personal collection that is now well known. He also tried the tonal ""chiaroscuro"" woodcut technique prevalent in that early period, here seen in an untitled example depicting a fragmented woodsman, one of the figure types he presented as modern heroes. Having made nearly one thousand prints in the course of his career, Baselitz stands out for his direct engagement with technical processes. He has described the resistance of copperplates, woodblocks, and linoleum blocks as creative forces in his art and has referred to prints as having ""symbolic power which has nothing to do with a painting."" He is also known for distinctive printed surfaces created with oil paint rather than printer's ink. Woman on the Beach and Nude with Three Arms are examples, and these prints garnered much attention during the Neo-Expressionist movement of the late 1970s and 1980s, when linoleum cut and woodcut had a great resurgence. Baselitz's wife, Elke, often assists him with printing, using a press in his studio, although he also works with master printers.","Linocut (0.961614), Woodcut (0.902629), Printmaking (0.732642), Neo-expressionism (0.711399), Printing (0.709031), Lyrical Abstraction (0.707596), Painting (0.676507), History of painting (0.664802)"

With curvilinear lines and biomorphic shapes, he sought to meld the realm of the unconscious to essential life forms, veering toward abstraction but always maintaining links to humanity, nature, and the cosmos. Miró's relationship to printmaking was tentative at first, with benefit prints such as Daphnis and Chloé for the periodical Minotaure, and Woman and Dog in Front of the Moon for an association of artists in Barcelona. It was when he was introduced to the painter Louis Marcoussis, who maintained a printshop in his studio, that he took up printmaking in earnest, and his natural inclinations toward new tools and materials blossomed. His methodical working process also suited these efforts, and prints of the Black and Red Series, created there, demonstrate his systematic use of more than one copperplate and his experiments with color inking. In the example here a symbolic family group responds in terror to a monstrous head, referring to Miró's anguish over the Spanish Civil War and the fear provoked by Generalissimo Francisco Franco at that time. Miró continued his exploration of intaglio techniques at Stanley William Hayter's Atelier 17 workshop in New York in the 1940s, when he was there on an extended visit. Soon after, he began his active involvement with lithography through the instigation of his Parisian dealer Aimé Maeght, making numerous individual prints, as well as posters, invitations, catalogue covers, and even holiday cards. He also turned increasingly to illustrated books, a format he had attempted earlier in his career, and created twentieth-century landmarks like À Toute épreuve, seen here. Further discoveries followed, with Miró making more than two thousand prints in all, always expanding his creativity through his love of technique and process.","Francisco Franco (0.968332), Printmaking (0.954701), Stanley William Hayter (0.755458), World War II (0.728913), Spanish Civil War (0.716033), Madrid (0.663192), Spain (0.528958), Catalonia (0.494265)"

It consists of a single symmetrical element, a pair of truncated pyramids stuck together at their base, then repeated to produce a continuous rhythmic line. In replicating the same abstract shape, Brancusi emphasized its potential for vertical expansion—it was, he later said, a “column for infinity.” In Brancusi's work generally the pedestal that traditionally supported sculpture, usually a secondary element, took on a new prominence, often equal to that of the artwork itself: he first used the geometric motif seen here in bases for his sculptures, but gradually realized its value as an independent form. He later repeated the Endless Column on larger scales and in different materials, making it serve as an architectural element and a monument. This version is carved directly in oak, with gouges and cuts in the wood readily apparent, so that it straightforwardly declares its own materials and process of making.

In 1956 he emigrated to West Berlin, where the dominant style was tachisme, a form of painterly abstraction that corresponded to late Abstract Expressionism in America. Baselitz rejected that style as decorative and instead evolved a vocabulary of disturbing figurative imagery that caused a scandal when it was exhibited. Eventually the figures in his paintings were depicted as fragmenting apart and soon thereafter were turned upside-down in what has become his hallmark. Baselitz's early experiences with printmaking began at a municipal workshop for artists in West Berlin. He started with etching and soon turned to woodcut. During a stay in Italy in the mid-1960s, he discovered sixteenth-century Mannerist prints and began a personal collection that is now well known. Having made nearly one thousand prints in the course of his career, Baselitz stands out for his direct engagement with technical processes. He has described the resistance of copperplates, woodblocks, and linoleum blocks as creative forces in his art and has referred to prints as having ""symbolic power which has nothing to do with a painting."" He is also known for distinctive printed surfaces created with oil paint rather than printer's ink. Woman on the Beach and Nude with Three Arms are examples, and these prints garnered much attention during the Neo-Expressionist movement of the late 1970s and 1980s, when linoleum cut and woodcut had a great resurgence. Baselitz's wife, Elke, often assists him with printing, using a press in his studio, although he also works with master printers.Originally from TextEntryID 69450 (TextTypeID 127)removed:He also tried the tonal ""chiaroscuro"" woodcut technique prevalent in that early period, here seen in an untitled example depicting a fragmented woodsman, one of the figure types he presented as modern heroes.","Linocut (0.957614), Woodcut (0.887118), Printmaking (0.729718), Neo-expressionism (0.70957), Lyrical Abstraction (0.690757), Printing (0.68968), Painting (0.650401), Abstract art (0.636226)"

The architects were aiming for a building that would be both a monumental civic structure and an informal one, reflecting the evolving role of the Western museum as a place of popular entertainment. ""High tech"" in some respects while traditional in others, the building was intended to relate simultaneously to its context—the city of Stuttgart, heavily rebuilt after World War II—and to the Staatsgalerie's original, neoclassical building, to which it would be attached. The design combines a wide range of architectural references both general and particular: Romanesque windows (seen in this drawing), Egyptian entrances, Greek columns, and allusions to specific buildings such as Karl Friedrich Schinkel's Altes Museum in Berlin, Gunnar Asplund's Stockholm Library, and Raphael's Villa Madama, Rome. These eclectic juxtapositions of traditional elements, along with the more contemporary presence of components in colored metals, result in an inventive and vibrant modern building. This drawing is an unusual perspective view of the main entrance, showing it from various vantage points at once—both from below and in elevation. The orange revolving doors and the blue canopy with its supporting green I-beam are viewed from beneath, while the wall with its Romanesque window, and the red beam to which the canopy is attached, are shown in elevation. Stirling made the drawing early in the project, and elements such as the informal and decorative metallic pink railings were relocated in the final design.","Altes Museum (0.964582), Neue Staatsgalerie (0.938776), Karl Friedrich Schinkel (0.906415), Stuttgart (0.872785), Neoclassicism (0.868967), Berlin (0.860268), Raphael (0.786821), Museum Island (0.678244)"

After studying stage design at the Academy of Art in Düsseldorf, he switched his focus to art and became a student of Joseph Beuys, the renowned Conceptual artist and teacher. Absorbing Beuys's revolutionary teachings and attitudes about art, Immendorff became a regular participant in neo-Dada ""Happenings"" and ""manifestations,"" using these actions as a means of expressing his political and artistic ideas. The specter of World War II and its ongoing repercussions have been of primary importance in Immendorff's work. Adopting an aggressive painterly style that harks back to that of the German Expressionists in the early twentieth century, he has addressed social issues in postwar Germany. The differing economic and political systems of what was then east and west is explored in a vocabulary of recurring symbols and images that have become integral to his iconography, which includes portraits of his friends and himself, sometimes gathered together in an imagined social setting he calls Café Deutschland. In other works, he uses disparate elements to construct his forms, as in Decisive Enemy, which includes a personified tank, a recurring image in his work, with clawlike feet. An active printmaker, Immendorff helped pioneer a new idiom for relief mediums such as woodcut and linoleum cut that had fallen out of favor as artistic mediums. Unconcerned with the concept of a uniform edition, he here exploits the expressive potential of his technique, boldly cutting the block in a purposely rough fashion and printing the impressions himself. This work was included in one of a series of three portfolios from the early 1980s that introduced the work of contemporary German painters to a broader audience through printmaking.","Art (0.95966), Printmaking (0.71097), World War II (0.583339), Aesthetics (0.557479), Expressionism (0.542892), 20th century (0.522069), Conceptual art (0.472051), Linocut (0.455351)"

R. Penck is among the first generation of artists that was greatly shaped by the historical, economic, and cultural rift that occurred in postwar Germany. Born Ralf Winkler, Penck lived under the totalitarian government of East Germany until he emigrated to the West in 1980. He began painting at the age of ten but was repeatedly rejected from state art academies as his work was not in line with the state-approved style of Socialist Realism. In response to this rejection, Penck studied reproductions of works by Rembrandt and Picasso, establishing his reputation as a self-taught artist, filmmaker, jazz musician, and poet, and eventually smuggled his works to West Germany for exhibition under various pseudonyms, including A. R. Penck, which became his primary alias. Penck is best known for the codified, schematic vocabulary of ""standarts"" he developed in the late 1960s. Comprised of graffiti-style stick figures and symbols, this pictorial language was inspired by Penck's study of the history of communication from ancient cave drawings to cybernetics. Designed as a series of ""direct symbols,"" his pictographs were a means of addressing social and political issues, as well as those of identity and rationality. Along with artist friends Georg Baselitz and Jörg Immendorff, Penck displayed an enthusiasm for the woodcut medium, which proved ideally suited to his bold, Neo-Expressionist style, as evidenced by prints such as Nightvision. Although he first started making small printed editions for personal use while living in East Germany, Penck began producing them in larger numbers after emigrating to the West. He has made approximately four hundred prints to date in lithography, etching, screenprint, and woodcut.","Printmaking (0.978377), Soviet Union (0.957279), Communism (0.941395), Georg Baselitz (0.866766), A.

The plan calls for a steel-and-concrete, eight-to-ten-story, U-shaped building frame erected in a densely populated urban area. The developer would sell lots within this frame, each lot the site for a house and garden in a style chosen by the purchaser. The result would be a distinct villagelike community on each floor, with interior streets. A central mechanical core would serve these homes and gardens, while shops, offices, and other facilities on the ground and middle floors would provide for the residents' needs. Whereas urban skyscrapers are normally made up of identical, stacked, boxlike units, the Highrise of Homes would allow flexibility and individual choice. The wide variety of house styles, gardens, hedges, and fences described in this intricate rendering provides a sense of the personal identity and human connection that are generally erased by the austere and repetitive elements of architectural formalism. Placing the sociological and psychological needs of the inhabitant over the aesthetic sensibilities of the architect, Wines produces a merge of suburb and city, a collage of architectures collectively created by its inhabitants and by the art of chance.

Later he became deeply inspired by the social content of the great Mexican muralists after seeing José Clemente Orozco at work, and in the 1930s he executed large-scale public murals in their heroic style for the government's Works Progress Administration. Guston began making abstract paintings in the 1950s, which earned him major recognition. His artistic evolution, however, was far from over. By the late 1960s he had developed a new figurative style inspired in part by the comic books he had so loved as a child, but with a far darker and more pessimistic world view. Based on a new personal iconography of bricks, bottles, hooded Klansmen, and references to his personal struggles and life as a painter, these works are executed in a consciously naive style that has been described as ""urban primitive."" This later vocabulary dominates Guston's printmaking, an activity with which he became seriously involved only in the last year of his life. Although he had made several lithographs at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop and with Irwin Hollander, printmaking had not been a regular part of his practice. Knowing that Guston preferred to work at home, publisher Gemini G.E.L. sent a master printer to his Woodstock, New York, studio in 1980, resulting in twenty-five of his approximately forty known prints, including Coat. The previous year, he had suffered a near–fatal heart attack, and both his life and work were dominated by thoughts of his mortality. In Coat, perhaps a self-portrait, the figure stands strong but seems to be sinking in a choppy sea, weighed down by old shoes that symbolize a long and difficult journey through life.","Great Depression (0.944135), Printmaking (0.90873), Lithography (0.876614), Abstract art (0.758443), Printing (0.721315), Philip Guston (0.706819), Lucie Silvas (0.69672), Mexico (0.674521)"

In Tunisia, he was fascinated by the pastel-colored desert mirages floating mysteriously near the horizon.To shoot Chott el-Djerid, the artist used one video camera set on a tripod and meticulously framed his subject from a fixed vantage point.

He was among the few individuals who navigated between abstract and figurative modes of painting with critical success over the course of his career. Beginning in the late 1940s, Diebenkorn periodically turned to printmaking as a means of reevaluating his creative process and reworking his ideas, eventually completing approximately two hundred prints. Preferring to work in intaglio mediums, he established an important collaborative relationship in the 1960s with printer Kathan Brown at Crown Point Press. In the mid-1950s Diebenkorn began working in a loose figurative style that he developed after abandoning the abstraction for which he had first received attention. In 1966 he embarked on a monumental abstract series that would occupy him for the next twenty years, the approximately one hundred fifty paintings entitled Ocean Park. Named for the Santa Monica neighborhood where he had a studio, the large-scale Ocean Park paintings deal with concerns of space and surface in a luminous palette inspired by the California landscape around him. Despite his inherent abilities as a colorist, Diebenkorn had long resisted using color in his prints, in part because he feared that technical difficulties would prevent him from achieving the results he desired. However, with Brown's encouragement, he began the series Eight Color Etchings in 1980. This group, which includes Large Light Blue, successfully translates the formal concerns, aesthetic sensibility, and luminescent, transparent, layered color of the Ocean Park paintings. Pleased with the results, Diebenkorn continued making color prints in a variety of techniques until his death in 1993.","History of painting (0.978305), Western painting (0.855664), Lyrical Abstraction (0.65905), Painting (0.576634), Printmaking (0.555726), Color (0.532601), Abstract expressionism (0.48785), Santa Monica, California (0.427341)"

Between 1913 and 1930, he made more than eighty editioned works, many intended for book projects and primarily executed in lithography. Malevich's early style drew on a variety of native sources, including the lubok (inexpensive, popular prints), folk images and icons, as well as the Western European movements of Cubism and Futurism. In 1915 he exhibited the first works of Suprematism, an abstract style of painting that he pioneered, comprised of colored geometric forms on white backgrounds. As a supporter of the 1917 Revolution, Malevich sought ways to integrate art with utilitarian forms and practical functions through his group unovis (Affirmers of the New Art). His Suprematist designs were used in applied-arts projects, and even in decorations for the streets of Vitebsk. In 1918 his design for the program of an important state-sponsored conference on peasant poverty, held on the first anniversary of the October Revolution, won first prize. Malevich's Suprematist cover for the publication declares: ""Proletarians of all Nations, Unite!"" In 1920, while Director of the Vitebsk Art Institute, Malevich created Suprematism: 34 Drawings, which essentially served as a theoretical and visual textbook of Suprematism. In addition to a hand-lettered introduction, the book contains lithographs that comprise a visual survey of basic geometric elements and ways in which they could be combined.

On one side of Graves's bridge, in Fargo, lie a concert hall and a public-radio and television station; an interpretive center for the region's cultural heritage lies on the other; and an art museum, shown in this drawing, bridges the two. The drawing is what Graves terms ""definitive"": preceded by referential and preparatory drawings that are incomplete and fragmentary, it reflects the final proposal for the built object through dimension, proportion, and detail. Graves's palette of terra-cotta and blue visually reinforces the significance of the building as a bridge, an extension of the earth situated midway between sky and water. Inversions of architectural elements do the same: voids in what would traditionally be the sites of keystones, and columns displaced from the sides of arches to their centers, transmit the light above to the water below. In the case of the center column, this vertical connection is literally constructed: the column's capital appears visually as a window of light supported by a shaft of water. Graves's work, often called ""postmodern"", is a departure from the functionalist and formal foundations of the International Style. It was significantly influenced by the notion of the architectural sign theorized by Robert Venturi in Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture (1966): like Venturi, Graves uses architectural elements representationally rather than structurally or functionally. He is a painter as well as an architect, and his use of drawing alone as a medium through which to design echoes the ""pure visibility"" of his architecture, in which meaning is collapsed onto the facade in a pastiche of color and form.","Architecture (0.948681), Structural engineering (0.687313), Robert Venturi (0.6714), Postmodernism (0.666286), Lauren Reed (0.618406), National Medal of Arts (0.603506), Red River of the North (0.582778), Architect (0.569951)"

Thus, elements such as columns and walls are separated from an aesthetic and functional context and used as part of a notational system. The inscription at the lower left of this work —“Building may be the mere representation of an idea first stated in drawing”—indicates the primacy of drawing in Eisenman's thought process.

The involvement of the painters of these movements with poetry produced a variety of rapports between the two arts, some of which endowed their peinture-poésie with new and unexpected dimensions, but others of which tended to vitiate their painting through a dilution of aesthetic modes. Arp's collages, reliefs, and sculpture share with his poetry an iconography...a gentle whimsy, and a feeling of naturalness, but nowhere is their plasticity compromised.For three years prior to the emergence of his personal style in the winter of 1915/1916, Arp had worked within the discipline of Cubism. Then in collages, and in machine-sawn reliefs such as the Portrait of Tzara of 1916 and Enak's Tears of 1917, the prevailing rectilinear structures of the Cubist work dissolved under the pressure of a new curvilinear, ""organic"" morphology.This biomorphism had its roots in Art Nouveau, although there it was primarily linear in style and botanical in its associations. Arp established it in terms of closed flat forms that were endowed with anthropomorphic allusions as well....In the face of Analytic Cubism's searching but ultimately assured equilibrium and stasis, Arp's reliefs unwind in an improvisational, meandering manner that implies growth and change. Here is no longer the sober, classical scaffolding of the external world of architecture. The forms of the Portrait of Tzara and Enak's Tears, while describing nothing specifically, multiply associations to physiological and botanical processes, to sexuality, and through their very ambiguity, to humor. Although biomorphism initiated a new vocabulary of forms, it did not in itself constitute a style in the sense that Impressionism or Cubism did; nor did it generate any new comprehensive principle of design or distribution of the total surface, or of the illusion of space, in pictures. Rather it provided constituent shapes for paintings in a variety of styles. When more than one or two such shapes are used by the ""abstract"" Surrealists we almost always find them disposed in relation to one another and to the frame in a Cubist manner. Thus, while we may speak of the form-language or morphology of Arp, [André] Masson, and [Joan] Miró as anti-Cubist, this does not apply to the over-all structure of their compositions, since on that level these painters cling to organizational principles assimilated from the Cubism that all of them had practiced earlier.","Surrealism (0.956876), Painting (0.760704), Cubism (0.71597), History of painting (0.663471), Pablo Picasso (0.571277), Sculpture (0.515891), Collage (0.51449), Francis Picabia (0.49701)"

Born in The Netherlands, he emigrated to the United States in 1926 by stowing away on a boat bound for New York from Rotterdam. Initially he supported himself as a commercial artist and sign painter, but soon became involved in the active group of artists and intellectuals that were centered in his Greenwich Village neighborhood. De Kooning made tentative forays into printmaking at various points in his career: in 1943 he experimented at Atelier 17, the workshop run by Stanley William Hayter that had temporarily relocated from Paris to New York; in 1957 he created an etching for an illustrated book project; in 1960 he made two large lithographs at the University of California at Berkeley in a single day, famously using a mop to draw on the lithographic stones; and in 1966, he contributed a lithograph to a portfolio published by his friend, master printer Irwin Hollander. However, 1970 proved to be an extremely intense and productive period of printmaking for the artist. Just back from Japan and newly inspired by calligraphy and Sumi ink painting, de Kooning thought that lithography might provide a new means to investigate these ideas. Executed in black and white, the twenty-four lithographs editioned during his year-long collaboration with Hollander are full of figurative references that dissolve into loose, gestural brushwork, drips, and splashes. This example makes a playful reference to his best-known body of work, his Women, which are usually more aggressively depicted. With the artist's title as a clue, the viewer can make out the white high heels of the titular cartoon character. Although de Kooning issued editions after 1971, that year marked the end of his most active period of printmaking.","Printmaking (0.94619), Willem de Kooning (0.707046), Abstract expressionism (0.604548), New York City (0.580728), Lithography (0.569559), Ink and wash painting (0.453302), Painting (0.448715), New York School (0.431228)"

Whereas, form wants only freedom to be; it belongs to the heart.”Following a sixteen-year absence from printmaking, Albers again embraced the medium, creating woodcuts that more strongly relied upon chance and free association than the precise abstractions for which he is best known.

From 1900 until his death in 1954 he completed more than eight hundred intaglios, lithographs, woodcuts, linoleum cuts, and monotypes. His attitude toward printmaking was a somewhat unconventional one in that for him it was a personal process, an extension of drawing, and a means of unwinding after long and intense periods of painting. As such, there were several distinct times during which Matisse was particularly active in the medium: 1906, 1914, and during the 1920s. In 1929 alone he made more than one hundred etchings and drypoints. The intimate nature of Matisse's printmaking is visible in his working process. Unlike many artists who depended on close relationships with master printers in their workshops, Matisse spent more time on an etching press installed in his studio that allowed him to print when and as he liked. This intimacy is also evident in his choice of subjects, which were mostly portraits of friends, family, and fellow artists, as well as images of female figures and nudes, including a great number of odalisques made after a trip to North Africa. Matisse's etchings and drypoints were executed on a small scale with linear fluidity, giving them a sense of immediacy and spontaneity, like pages in a sketchbook. Alternately, his lithographs were on a larger scale and made grander statements. These lithographs exploited the tonal possibilities of the medium that allowed Matisse to achieve effects of volume and depth. Illustrated books also form a significant part of Matisse's oeuvre. He collaborated on thirty-eight such projects over the course of his career. His first book, Poésies, of 1932, included mythologically inspired images based on texts by Stéphane Mallarmé, while his Jazz of 1947, known for its brightly colored pochoirs, is widely considered one of the most important illustrated books of the modern period.","Printmaking (0.984091), History of painting (0.52985), Etching (0.521699), Woodcut (0.512642), Linocut (0.511717), Drawing (0.508544), Intaglio (0.50304), Painting (0.499916)"

The bold geometric fragments of contrasting types of paper interlaced with the figurative motifs drawn in charcoal evoke the structure of a fugue, in which two distinct melodies intertwine in a rich, sonorous composition, each acting as a foil to the other's reality.The invention of the papier collé in 1912 by Braque and Pablo Picasso introduced a revolution in Western painting, whose repercussions are still being felt today. By pasting fragments of paper (newspaper, wallpaper, and wood-grained paper) onto their still-life compositions, they introduced  real materials and textures into an art hitherto based on illusionistic renderings.The significance of this breakthrough cannot be overestimated because through this technique these artists declared the autonomy of the painted or drawn image, and radically severed it from any attempt at representation. The fragments attached to the picture's surface rarely followed the contours or silhouettes of the drawn motifs (glasses, bottles, or musical instruments), but, paradoxically, contradicted them. Thus, they countered the conventional devices of modeling and depth perspective, and drew attention to the absolute flatness of the two-dimensional plane.","Painting (0.977816), Pablo Picasso (0.923788), Henri Matisse (0.901576), Cubism (0.835362), Georges Braque (0.831211), Collage (0.74889), Music (0.650921), Musical instrument (0.647042)"

These individuals serve as matrices for his explorations of scale, color, light, form, and composition. Yet the often distant expressions of their faces—primarily depicting family members, friends, and art-world figures he knows personally—combined with his selective documentation of their up-to-date clothes and hairstyles, make him, de facto, an interpreter of contemporary life. For Katz, printmaking has served as both an opportunity to refine his imagery and as a springboard to further work. In the 1950s, he made linoleum cuts and stencils that influenced his move into collage and his use of flat, static colors in his paintings. Since the mid-1960s, he has collaborated with numerous printers and publishers to produce more than two hundred prints in a variety of techniques. The aquatints shown here are from an illustrated book containing fourteen portraits of second-generation New York School poets, interleaved with a poem about contemporary life contributed by each. These poets are among Katz's circle of friends, who became acquainted at parties, poetry readings, and art openings in the 1960s and 1970s. For this project he first painted the portraits on aluminum in a hybrid format he called ""cutouts"" that silhouettes the figures. He then traced the outlines of these portraits onto copperplates, cutting them out to serve as shaped printing surfaces. The soft tonal quality of the aquatint technique he used lends an intimacy to his characterizations, while the book format allowed Katz to juxtapose each portrait with that poet's verse.","Poetry (0.981112), Printing (0.606431), Printmaking (0.553838), Painting (0.495022), Linocut (0.470217), Verse (0.458852), Aquatint (0.450363), Head of state (0.443864)"

Born in Pittsburgh, he received his BFA from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1962 and throughout the 1960s explored linguistic and mathematical systems through installations and drawings. In the ensuing decades, his work in painting, photography, and printmaking has continued to demonstrate an underlying basis in Conceptual thinking. Bochner created his first prints in 1973 at the invitation of publisher Robert Feldman of Parasol Press, who, working with Crown Point Press, introduced a generation of Minimalist and Conceptual artists to printmaking. Since then Bochner has worked in various print techniques, focusing predominantly on aquatint and monoprint. Since 1995 he has made more than two hundred monoprints in collaboration with David Lasry at Two Palms Press in New York. His editioned prints number about seventy. Rules of Inference is based on two similarly titled previous works: a site-specific floor installation from 1972 and a charcoal-and-gouache drawing from 1973. In the installation, the numbers from one through nine are represented by configurations of pebbles inferred from mathematical principles and connected by chalk lines. The drawing echoes the installation, with black circles on white paper. The third generation of this Conceptual work is the print, with a deep black aquatint surface that does not include connective lines. Its impact is of a more indeterminate and mysterious nature than its predecessors, obscuring the artist's basis in logic and certainty. In fact, the subject of all these works is not the specific mathematical principles from which they were derived, but rather the relationships between things and the process of perceiving these relationships.","Conceptual art (0.989871), Logic (0.782725), Printmaking (0.674316), Contemporary art (0.638704), Mel Bochner (0.569847), Installation art (0.547574), Monotyping (0.496001), Visual arts (0.470408)"

Long's art, however, also inflects more recent ideas. Like certain Minimalist sculptures, Cornish Stone Circle has no base or pedestal, no height to speak of, nor is it even an intact mass. More, its mass is mutable: the circle must be three meters in radius, and its fifty-two rough stones must be stably situated, evenly distributed and separated, and randomly arranged, but otherwise their placement is open to change. Long's most searching revision of the character of the art object, however, has to do with his relationship with the natural environment. Like other earthworks artists, he is attracted to outdoor, often remote, terrain, where he may pile stones, mark a path, or simply take a long walk; later he may exhibit photographs, maps, or written descriptions of these actions, for his work shares Conceptual art's concern with the different experiences conveyed by different visual and verbal systems.

Alternating between figurative and abstract approaches, his work intentionally defies stylistic categorization. He was first recognized in the early 1960s as co–founder, with Sigmar Polke and others, of Capitalist Realism, a group dedicated to the objective depiction of society in an increasingly commodity–oriented Germany. Photography was central to Richter's pictorial documentation and his rejection of the Expressionist painting popular at the time. In 1962 he began making paintings directly after photographs, family snapshots, or newspaper illustrations, aligning himself with a European manifestation of Pop art. But by constantly questioning modes of perception and artistic representation, he has given his work an element of Conceptual art as well.Richter began making prints in 1965 and has completed more than one hundred to date; he was most active before 1974, completing projects only sporadically since that time. He has explored a variety of photographic printmaking processes—screenprint, photolithography, and collotype—in search of inexpensive mediums that would lend a ""non-art"" appearance to his work. Although interested in the wide dissemination of imagery that printmaking offers, he has avoided the collaborative workshop prerequisites of the more traditional techniques. These three prints reveal the political undertones common in Richter's work of the late 1960s. His imagery of fighter planes reflects the World War II bombing of his native Dresden as well as the hotly debated topic of German rearmament raging in the national press at the time. The work's off–register printing simulates the hazy afterimage of mass–produced newspaper illustrations while also emphasizing the planes' sonic speed. Portraiture has also been an important genre for Richter, with Mao and Elisabeth II among the most haunting examples from this period. The ghostlike heads bleed off the sheets, fusing an aura of power and inaccessibility with a posterlike immediacy.","Gerhard Richter (0.985989), Sigmar Polke (0.703567), Painting (0.660419), Kunstakademie Dsseldorf (0.638919), World War II (0.604282), History of painting (0.590492), Expressionism (0.568437), Art (0.565613)"

To make the photograph, Eggleston adopted a viewpoint even lower than the eye-level of the tricycle's owner, so as to give us a clear view between its wheels to the grown-up sedan parked in the carport across the street. Eggleston's photographs began as Kodachrome slides, a popular medium of amateur photography, and they resemble snapshots in the way they forthrightly describe ordinary people and objects, framed squarely in the center of the picture. Critics who found this resemblance grounds for dismissing the work overlooked the paradoxical power of snapshots. To the insider, snapshots are keys that open reservoirs of memory and feeling; to the outsider, who does not recognize the faces or know the stories, they are forever opaque. But because we all have snapshots of our own, we know the habit of understanding them and of projecting ourselves into the dramas and passions they conceal.Color became available to the ordinary photographer in the 1950s and 1960s, but before then photography had been a black-and-white medium for more than a century.

Passing belongs to a venerable genre—it is a self-portrait—but has the scale of Abstract Expressionism. Another inspiration is the advertising billboard; like the Pop artists, Katz pays attention to the cultural scene. Meanwhile, his reductive approach and his conception of pictorial space match those in the formalist painting of the 1960s.The ground in Passing is a flat monochrome, and Katz's face and shoulders are so simplified that it is mainly their clarity as parts of a figure that insinuates their volume.

She had her first solo gallery show at the age of twenty-three in 1951, and painted her landmark work, Mountains and Sea, the following year. In the late 1950s, a printmaking renaissance was beginning, and some of Frankenthaler's fellow artists began encouraging her to try the medium. In 1961, at the invitation of Tatyana Grosman, Frankenthaler ventured out to Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE), Grosman's Long Island printmaking studio, and began making lithographs.  Frankenthaler has said, “After the first day there I felt no hesitation. I was very committed. All I had to do was start work on that print. It was a whole new road-and a very connected road.” By 1976 Frankenthaler had made about fifty prints, thirty-seven of them at ULAE, in mediums including lithography, intaglio, screenprint, pochoir, and woodcut. In that year, she was invited to the new Bedford, New York, workshop of Kenneth Tyler, formerly of Gemini G.E.L. in Los Angeles. Working there, she revolutionized woodcut, a medium generally out of favor with artists at that time. With Essence Mulberry, duly inspired by the faded colors of hand-painted fifteenth-century prints seen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and a lushly ripe mulberry tree on Tyler's property, Frankenthaler set out to re-create the look of painting with mulberry juice. She carved four blocks, one each of oak, birch, walnut and lauan, all having different printed effects. A reinvention of the technique, the ethereal Essence Mulberry differs from most major woodcuts of the modern period, which tend toward a bold expressionist idiom. To date Frankenthaler has completed about one hundred twenty-five editions and one hundred fifteen monotypes.","Printmaking (0.958096), Printing (0.460314), Lyrical Abstraction (0.443505), Intaglio (0.438683), Abstract expressionism (0.435621), Lithography (0.394623), Woodcut (0.389745), Metropolitan Museum of Art (0.360175)"

It made sense to paint an image of something you could recognize and feel something about."" Having found herself doodling a horse on a bit of canvas in 1973, Rothenberg shortly began a series of full-scale paintings of horses. These works anticipated the powerful return of figurative and subjective content in American and European art of the late 1970s and 1980s. Rothenberg, however, runs the emotional immediacy of figurative art through the filter of abstraction. In Axes, her working of the paint favors its material presence over its illusionistic or expressive possibilities. The body of the horse is a largely flat white—there is little modeling to give it volume or detail to give it character. It shares that white with the ground around it, which it traverses improbably slantwise, and straight lines cross both body and ground, insisting that they are constituents of the same flat surface. The result is neither wholly representational nor wholly abstract, and reflects the ideas of its time even while it breaks from them: ""I was able to stick to the philosophy of the day—keeping the painting flat and anti-illusionist—but I also got to use this big, soft, heavy, strong, powerful form.""

The title page, with its mythological imagery and epigraph by the Romantic poet Friedrich Hölderlin, belies Klinger's meticulous, unsentimental detailing of six stories of jealousy, murder, misery, and revolution set in 1880s Berlin. Influenced by French naturalist literature, especially the writings of Emile Zola, Klinger wanted these prints to provide an exacting, unmediated transcription of social reality. (He later distanced himself from this literary approach.) Klinger's scrupulous rendering of the setting in the print In Flagranti nearly overwhelms the dramatic events. The zigzag composition, however, draws the eye from the still-smoking gun of the cuckolded husband in the upper window to his horrified wife on the terrace below to the legs of her dead lover sprawled out on the ground. Three prints, Eine Mutter I–III (A mother I–III), record the real-life desperation of a battered woman, who in 1881, seeing no way out of Berlin's carceral back-alley dwellings, jumped into a canal with her son. She was rescued; he was not. Although absolved by the judicial system, she remained trapped in the conditions of her time, just as she is penned in a dark corner in this print. The specter of civil unrest is the subject of Märztage II (March days II), from another three-print sequence within the portfolio. The imagery recalls the uprisings in 1848, when Germans agitated for democracy, unification, and social change. But a Litfaßsäule, a type of advertising column installed only after 1855, places the events in Klinger's day. With this portfolio, Klinger suggests that revolution might rock Germany once again.","mile Zola (0.918067), Literature (0.879428), Sociology (0.838115), Naturalism (0.788674), Drama (0.749879), Wife (0.744091), Husband (0.733197), Separation of powers (0.72657)"

Kelly's paintings and sculptures appear to be hard-edged abstractions, but they are, in fact, inspired by organic and architectural forms, and his work has long included naturalistic outline drawings of foliage and flowers. Unlike the Abstract Expressionists who preceded him, Kelly is an artist whose work is premeditated and planned, and he strives for flat, unmodulated areas of saturated color and the elimination of his own personal mark, qualities visible in the early lithograph Red-Orange. Printmaking has been an important part of Kelly's oeuvre since the 1960s. Working primarily in lithography at Gemini G.E.L in Los Angeles and at the workshop of Kenneth Tyler, formerly master printer and co-founder of Gemini, he has completed approximately three hundred editions. Kelly's collaborations with Tyler include the highly experimental series Colored Paper Images. The twenty-three works in this series were created by ladling colored paper pulp into plastic and metal forms and then applying the pressure of the printing press to fuse the colored pulp to a wet sheet of paper. These prints retain the basic characteristics of Kelly's work: his vocabulary of geometric shapes, curves, and arcs, and his brilliant color. However, this project also marks a departure for the artist in several ways. The bleed of the wet paper pulp prevents the shapes from achieving a clean edge, while the tactile texture of the handmade paper and pulp introduces a new variability of surface. Further, the unpredictable nature of the materials allows chance to enter into Kelly's highly controlled working process. The result is significant variations between impressions within each edition.","Printmaking (0.953623), Printing (0.925837), Color Field (0.85736), Lyrical Abstraction (0.793354), Abstract expressionism (0.766148), Paper (0.735836), Modernism (0.696482), Charles Fenerty (0.602842)"

Their style, ""Orphism,"" alludes to the Greek god and musician Orpheus. Delaunay-Terk's investigations into simultaneity include her internationally acclaimed designs in the applied arts, ranging from textiles to advertisements to book bindings. Comprised of brightly colored arabesques, concentric circles, triangles, and rectangles, Delaunay-Terk's pochoir illustrations for Blaise Cendrars's poem and its radical format have made this a landmark in the history of the modern book. The poet and the artist conceived of this project as the first ""simultaneous book."" When closed, the accordion-folded volume can be slipped into a wrapper. Opened out vertically, the format facilitates the contrast of the darker themes of the poem with the vibrant dynamism of the illuminations that accompany it. Written as a stream of consciousness, Cendrars's poem alternates between his memories of a train trip across Siberia in 1904 and thoughts of his girlfriend, Jehanne. Complementing the rhythms of the poem, Delaunay-Terk interspersed patches of color with the poet's staggered text, printed in twelve different fonts. The poem and the illustration both end with references to the Eiffel Tower and the ferris wheel, two architectural marvels of Paris at that time, further symbolizing modernity and the experiences of simultaneity that urban life provided. After Prose, Delaunay-Terk returned to book illustration intermittently throughout her career. Although she had made figurative intaglio prints between 1905 and 1910, it was not until the 1960s and 1970s that she experimented with screenprint, aquatint, lithography, and etching in her signature style.

Not surprisingly, the work took fourteen months to make.When Close began to paint portraits, in 1967-68, figurative painting was widely considered exhausted. The figures in Pop art were coolly ironic; and other artists were painting abstractions, or were abandoning painting altogether for more conceptual systems of art-making.

He was addressing the Chicago chapter of the American Institute of Architects, as part of a lecture tour—his first trip to the United States. The trip was prompted in part by an exhibition of Le Corbusier's work at The Museum of Modern Art, organized by Philip Johnson and Henry-Russell Hitchcock. Le Corbusier's first version of his plan for the North African city of Algiers, developed between 1930 and 1933, represented the culmination of his 1920s work on urban design, and especially of his concept of the Ville radieuse. Even in its several later incarnations, the plan was also a loud demonstration of the disruptive effects of his architecture, which tended to obliterate the past in order to build a better future. Well aware of this quality, the architect called his plan the ""Obus"" or ""shrapnel"" plan. It featured a business center on the docks, where the preexisting buildings were to be torn down; a residential neighborhood on the difficult, hilly site of the Fort l'Empereur; and a giant motorway, the land below it to be filled by homes for 180,000 people. The plan was as magniloquent as it was visionary, as is evident in the right half of the drawing, where Le Corbusier's blue pencil highlights the new buildings. The plan on the left shows his vision for the new city culminating in the new buildings on the docks, marked in red on a yellow field. The courage of Le Corbusier's Obus design, his readiness to tackle urban planning on a giant scale, influenced generations of later architects and indirectly informed the construction of a number of new cities such as Brasília. As for Le Corbusier himself, however, he continued to make new proposals until 1942, but his Algiers—like his other urban plans—was never built.","Urban planning (0.986165), Le Corbusier (0.898275), Architecture (0.789243), City (0.673827), Urban design (0.644745), Urban decay (0.523928), Landscape architecture (0.508119), Africa (0.476551)"

Restraining clusters of black collect in the upper part of the canvas, but their weight only heightens the force of the exuberant primaries, which seem to loft them by bubbling up from below.

Pressing in from the sides, and glimmering in the crevices among the patches of pigment, the white in Towards Disappearance, II only makes the colors brighter.Studying painting in California in the late 1940s, Francis had seen exhibitions of Abstract Expressionism, and had absorbed the ideas of the New York School. His next stop, though, was not New York but Paris, where he lived through much of the 1950s; he admired Pierre Bonnard and Henri Matisse, and was particularly influenced by the iridescent atmospheres of Claude Monet's Water Lilies series.

Indeed, this nearly fifty-four-foot-long frieze of blue bathers silhouetted against a white rectangular band was designed to adorn the walls of Matisse's dining room at the Hôtel Régina in Nice. At the time of its creation, the artist was restricted to his bed or to a wheelchair, and he conjured this lyrical depiction of the natural world for his personal enjoyment.Read from right to left, beginning and ending with a representation of a starfish, the contours of the diving or swimming forms eventually dissolve until the blue shapes define the splashing water and the negative white space represents the abstract figures. In a dynamic interplay with the background support, each bather flows rhythmically into the next, sometimes breaking free of the horizontal band in a graceful arabesque. Matisse combines contrasting viewing angles—from above looking down into the water or sideways as if from in the water—so that the different postures of the figures themselves determine the composition as a whole.

After painting as a Social Realist in the 1930s and 1940s, and then in a mode derived from Abstract Expressionism in the 1950s, Bearden ultimately found his own voice in the imaginative collages he made from 1964 on. Using a fragmented style inspired by the rhythms of jazz, he assembled magazine clippings into phantasmagorical invocations of the myths and rituals of black American life. Bearden did not take up printmaking seriously until the late 1960s, when he began to frequent the Printmaking Workshop, a non-profit studio run by his longtime friend, the artist and master printer Robert Blackburn. Over the next two decades he worked there and with other publishers and printers, eventually completing more than one hundred editioned prints in various techniques, as well as dozens of monotypes. Many of Bearden's prints, particularly his lithographs and screenprints, are based on existing collages and monotypes. With Blackburn's encouragement he also made some experimental collagraphs and intaglio prints that engage the collage process and printmaking in unusual and inventive ways. In The Train, for example, he recast a 1964 collage by adding new textures and colors. This was achieved by using mesh screens and photography to generate the photogravure plate, which was subsequently cut up so colored areas could be inked separately and reassembled jigsaw style for printing. The train of this print's title is a small detail at the upper left, but it nonetheless invokes larger issues of migration and segregation. As Bearden said, trains ""could take you away and could also bring you to where you were.

That priority freed him to create images dealing less with perception than with thought, so that the bird in this picture seems to fly not in front of the cat's forehead but inside it–the bird is literally on the cat's mind. Stressing this point by making the cat all head, Klee concentrates on thought, fantasy, appetite, the hungers of the brain. One of his aims as an artist, he said, was to ""make secret visions visible."" The cat is watchful, frighteningly so, but it is also calm, and Klee's palette too is calm, in a narrow range from tawny to rose with zones of bluish green. This and the suggestion of a child's drawing lighten the air. Believing that children were close to the sources of creativity, Klee was fascinated by their art, and evokes it here through simple lines and shapes: ovals for the cat's eyes and pupils (and, more loosely, for the bird's body), triangles for its ears and nose.

Are not the circle and the triangle, volumes and colors, as intelligible as this table?"" He began work on La Source soon afterward and showed it that October at an important annual exhibition in Paris, the Salon d'Automne. Also including abstract works by Frantiek Kupka and Fernand Leger, that year's edition of the Salon marked the public debut of abstraction in the city.La Source invokes the painting of Pablo Picasso in both its Rose Period palette and its fragmented planes, yet its large scale, crude paint handling, and erotic undertones, along with its defiant breach of the figurative tradition, also suggest a parody of Cubism's refinement. Upon seeing La Source, a critic wrote that Picabia had ""set the year's record for fantasy"" with ""ugly"" works that ""evoke incrusted linoleum.""","Cubism (0.954891), Pablo Picasso (0.842834), Abstract art (0.800712), Fernand Lger (0.599517), Guillaume Apollinaire (0.572076), Gertrude Stein (0.570663), Symbolism (0.529701), Georges Braque (0.522642)"

To accommodate rapidly changing technology and increasing miniaturization, new products had to be designed. Bellini was able to link the necessities of the developing electronics industry to contemporary visual culture by emphasizing tactile qualities and taking advantage of the expressive possibilities of such new materials as plastic.

In this vein the New York Birdcage—Imaginary Architecture Project describes the nonphysical ""waiting rooms"" charted by the airplanes that circulate in holding patterns above the greater New York area. This drawing illustrates their paths, the different colors indicating different ""rooms."" As in solid, earthbound architecture, each room is a dimensional space, with a floor, a ceiling, and walls, but it has no physical structure; existing only when ""drawn"" by the moving airplane, it depends entirely upon the airplane's presence and on the pilot's and air-traffic controller's consciousness of designated coordinates. Once the craft has moved on, the parameters become irrelevant and the room disappears. St. Florian sees these ""transparent, elusive, magnificent"" areas as imaginary forms suspended over our cities. Although St. Florian is known for his design of the National World War II Memorial, scheduled to be completed on the Mall in Washington, D.C., in 2003, he has spoken of the ""nuisance"" of projects ""actually being built"". As if working on paper shared in that nuisance, the Birdcage drawing itself exemplifies transience: it is drawn on a photographic reproduction of a map of New York, a base or template on which the imaginary architecture's temporary waiting rooms are overlaid in the lighter, less permanent medium of colored pencil.","New York metropolitan area (0.909437), World War II (0.884878), Color (0.838756), New York City (0.823538), Space (0.820576), Manhattan (0.776034), Pencil (0.734378), New York (0.734318)"

Influenced by prehistoric cave painting and Renaissance frescos in which the image is applied directly to the wall, Mangold strove to integrate paint and canvas in works that stress their frontality and flatness. His compositions often comprise multiple canvases, reflecting his ongoing themes of fragmented wholes and unified parts. In recent years his austere geometry and monochrome backgrounds have evolved into multicolored palettes and textured surfaces. Printmaking's potential for serial imagery made it a natural medium for Mangold, allowing him further experimentation with his variations on a theme. Since the 1980s he has frequently explored new ideas and motifs through printmaking, with imagery from prints preceding that in paintings. In addition, the delicate line attainable with etching, and the subtle tone and dense surfaces of aquatint, have been particularly suited to Mangold's Minimalist compositions. He has also worked extensively in screenprint, and in recent years has exploited the textured backgrounds achievable with the woodcut technique. He has printed with numerous shops around the United States and Europe, often collaborating with one or two for an extended period of time. Most notable are Crown Point Press and Simmelink/Sukimoto as well as Derriére L'Étoile and Spring Street Workshop. Since his first published projects in the late 1960s, Mangold has completed more than one hundred seventy-five prints, most of them comprised in serial portfolios. Seven Aquatints reveals Mangold's continued fascination with the relationships between interior and exterior forms.

Influenced by prehistoric cave painting and Renaissance frescos in which the image is applied directly to the wall, Mangold strove to integrate paint and canvas in works that stress their frontality and flatness. His compositions often comprise multiple canvases, reflecting his ongoing themes of fragmented wholes and unified parts. In recent years his austere geometry and monochrome backgrounds have evolved into multicolored palettes and textured surfaces. Printmaking's potential for serial imagery made it a natural medium for Mangold, allowing him further experimentation with his variations on a theme. Since the 1980s he has frequently explored new ideas and motifs through printmaking, with imagery from prints preceding that in paintings. In addition, the delicate line attainable with etching, and the subtle tone and dense surfaces of aquatint, have been particularly suited to Mangold's Minimalist compositions. He has also worked extensively in screenprint, and in recent years has exploited the textured backgrounds achievable with the woodcut technique. He has printed with numerous shops around the United States and Europe, often collaborating with one or two for an extended period of time. Most notable are Crown Point Press and Simmelink/Sukimoto as well as Derrière L'Étoile and Spring Street Workshop. Since his first published projects in the late 1960s, Mangold has completed more than one hundred seventy-five prints, most of them comprised in serial portfolios. Seven Aquatints reveals Mangold's continued fascination with the relationships between interior and exterior forms. He creates a palpable tension between the perfect outer circle and the flawed interior square.

Unable to obtain a visa to remain in London, she immigrated to Venezuela, where she worked as an architect and furniture designer in Caracas for more than a decade. She turned to painting, drawing, and printmaking in the early 1950s. A unique figure among Venezuelan abstractionists of the 1960s and 1970s, Gego inflected geometric abstraction with expressive subjectivity. In addition to sculpture and drawing, she worked consistently in the printmaking medium in the 1960s. In this body of prints, she experimented with many of the forms and concepts that would appear in her sculpture almost a decade later. During her career, she completed some one hundred etchings and lithographs and a handful of illustrated books. Many of these works were created in her studio or at the printmaking workshop TAGA (Taller de Artistas Gráficos Asociados), which she helped found in Caracas with fellow artist Luisa Palacios. Gego also created prints at a number of important printmaking workshops in the United States, including Iowa State University in 1959 and Pratt Graphic Art Center in New York in 1963. An extended fellowship in 1966 enabled her to make lithographs at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop in Los Angeles.

Completing some three hundred prints during his lifetime, he experimented extensively with etching, lithography, and woodcut, making his most significant printed work during the early 1920s in response to the horror of the war and its aftermath. In 1909 Dix moved to Dresden to study art. At the onset of World War I he volunteered to serve as a machine gunner and suffered serious wounds in front-line advances through Belgium and France. When he returned to Dresden to resume his studies, Dix joined a group of young radical Expressionists and also had contact with Dadaists, whose anarchism encouraged his growing nihilism. Directing a critical eye toward German society, Dix became preoccupied with subjects like veterans and urban decay, as well as prostitution and the destructive power of sex. In Syphilitic, evil temptation literally fills a man's head, as he suffers from the madness brought on by this disease. In the early 1920s, Dix was encouraged by art dealer Karl Nierendorf to make prints for broad distribution. He turned to illustrating the devastation of the trench warfare he had experienced, creating an epic series of fifty intaglios that have been compared to Goya's The Disasters of War. The imagery in this series differs radically from the 1916–18 Futurist-influenced sketches he had made at the front, when, deeply interested in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, he enthusiastically embraced war as an inevitable part of life. In these later images, Dix portrays the destructive effects of war, including rotting corpses and bombed cities and landscapes, as well as its dehumanizing impact. In Storm Troops Advance under Gas Attack, soldiers are shown as menacing ghouls whose depravity is emphasized by terrifying gas masks.Originally from TextEntryID 69314 (TextTypeID 127)The Disasters of War  (see page 18)","World War I (0.973854), World War II (0.682975), Printmaking (0.592025), Trench warfare (0.507433), Dada (0.480565), Otto Dix (0.477365), Friedrich Nietzsche (0.428253), Stormtrooper (0.418402)"

When a devastating fire destroyed his workshop in 1958, he rethought his goals and turned back to art, first making non-functional, furniture-inspired sculpture that allowed him to ""explore the world of the subjective."" In the 1960s he began producing monochromatic paintings by applying acrylic to textured surfaces of celotex, an industrial building material. His imagery was based on anonymous snapshots or newspaper and magazine photographs. In 1969 publisher and gallery owner Brooke Alexander invited Artschwager to make his first editioned multiple. While this small, three-dimensional format has meshed easily with his sculptural vision, he has also made about twenty individual prints related to the concerns of his paintings. This body of printed work demonstrates the capacity of techniques such as screenprint and etching to further the investigations of Conceptual art practice. Artschwager's work explores recognition and perception as integral steps in the subjective cognitive process. In Interior, through its implied sequential alteration of perspective, he animates the space of one room by moving the viewer through space and time in a cinematic fashion. Each panel stands for the viewer's partial view of the space, yet in juxtaposition a larger sense of the room is revealed.

By then he had abandoned the painterly conventions he found alienating and was making canvases using photographs and texts. Works like I Will Not Make Any More Boring Art, his first print, demonstrate his thinking at the time and his developing interest in Conceptual art. Created at Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in conjunction with an unconventional exhibition, it depicts a sentence that Baldessari instructed students to write on the gallery walls ""like punishment."" He was not present at the ""exhibition,"" nor at the workshop where the print was made. He simply sent a handwritten page to be reproduced and made a videotape of himself writing the sentence. Such activities were typical of this school's experimental program in the 1970s. Its lithography workshop, in particular, served to broaden the scope of printmaking by inviting artists like Baldessari, Vito Acconci, Dennis Oppenheim, and others to explore its potential for Conceptual art projects. Baldessari has gone on to make about ninety prints, primarily in his signature photo-collage style. An example of his collages, made from stills of old B-movies superimposed with geometric shapes, is seen here in an illustration for a special edition of Tristram Shandy. This spread is part of an accordion-folded volume of his illustrations commissioned by Andrew Hoyem of The Arion Press. When Hoyem learned of Baldessari's interest in Laurence Sterne's novel of 1760, he invited him to participate in a new publication that matches Sterne's disregard for plot and punctuation with the artist's own disjointed imagery. The project also includes a volume of the complete text with all its eccentricities intact, and another containing a critical essay.","Conceptual art (0.967385), Printmaking (0.681381), Laurence Sterne (0.668118), Art (0.538097), Visual arts (0.528449), John Baldessari (0.50505), The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (0.48945), Abstraction (0.48862)"

It repeatedly notes how chance and structure play intimate roles in our perception of the world in general.

And, while the tree trunks make strong vertical accents, they vary in thickness and shape; and they group themselves into pairs, like three figures poised for action.

Jackson Pollock, however, managed to make prints intermittently throughout his career by taking advantage of occasions that presented themselves and by availing himself of the skills of mentors and other acquaintances who were familiar with techniques and had access to facilities. Since most of his lithographs, engravings, and screenprints were experimental and did not result in standardized editions, this aspect of his work is hardly known. In fact, the methodical nature of printmaking seems contrary to the image of Pollock as a wild man pouring paint on canvas in a kind of private performance. Pollock's prints, nearly fifty compositions in all, went through evolving states, trial proofs, variant inking and uses of paper, and hand additions. The work illustrated here comes from a group of eleven plates he prepared at Atelier 17, a printing facility established by Stanley William Hayter in Paris and relocated to New York during World War II. It was there that exiled European artists gathered and introduced the principles of Surrealism to their young American counterparts. Hayter himself encouraged a method of engraving that allowed for a spontaneous articulation of line resembling ""automatism,"" an unfettered Surrealist drawing technique in which thoughts and desires deep in the subconscious were prompted to the surface. Pollock's engravings reflect his absorption not only of automatist drawing, but also of totemic imagery of the American Southwest, mythic archetypes from his Jungian psychoanalysis, and the work of such artists as Joan Miró and Pablo Picasso. This print is a quintessential example of that realm between representation and abstraction occupying him in the mid-1940s and ultimately leading to the totally abstract, linear skeins of his most celebrated canvases.","Printmaking (0.948246), Pablo Picasso (0.499877), Abstract expressionism (0.498542), Stanley William Hayter (0.359458), World War II (0.3401), Printing (0.33159), Surrealism (0.320558), Drawing (0.317555)"

In Study, a dancer (Talley Beatty) moves effortlessly within and between different environments (forest, living room, museum gallery, etc.), an achievement arrived at through the careful matching of his precisely choreographed movements with the film's editing pattern. As Beatty leaps from space to space across Deren's film splices, a new geographical reality is created, one where great distances can be covered within the span of just four minutes.

His views embraced such fundamental issues as order and chaos, life and death, man and nature, as well as spirituality and metaphysics. His abstract, often monochromatic works that incorporate signature ""zips,"" vertical bands that cut through the picture plane, were influential for the later Minimalists. Throughout his career, Newman experienced periods when he stopped painting altogether. During one such episode, following the death of his brother George in 1960, he was introduced to lithography by a concerned friend, fellow painter Cleve Gray, who thought that working in a new medium might spark Newman's interest. He directed Newman to the Pratt Graphic Art Center, a print workshop loosely affiliated with Brooklyn's Pratt Institute. The Graphic Art Center was available to students as well as established artists looking to experiment with printmaking mediums. Newman made three lithographs at Pratt in 1961, including this Untitled work, which can be viewed in relation to his monumental painting cycle and personal meditation on mortality, The Stations of the Cross: Lema Sabachthani of 1958–66.Newman described himself as being ""captivated"" by lithography and by the various possibilities offered by different inks and papers. In the final decade of his life, he was an extremely productive printmaker, creating approximately forty editions in a variety of mediums.

In 1905 he moved to Dresden to study architecture and began experimenting with the woodcut technique the same year. Dropping out of school after one semester, he formed the Brücke (Bridge) group with Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Fritz Bleyl, both of whom he had met through his childhood friend, artist Erich Heckel, also a founder. During his career as a painter and printmaker, Schmidt-Rottluff made more than six hundred printed images in woodcut, lithography, and etching. The woodcut technique dominated Schmidt-Rottluff's printed work from approximately 1909 to 1920. By 1911 he had moved to Berlin, where, increasingly exposed to Cubism and African and Oceanic art, his work grew more abstract, with angular lines and flattened shapes. In 1915 he was conscripted into the army and served for three years in Russia and Lithuania before returning to Berlin in 1918. These prints were made during the war years when, traumatized by the brutality he witnessed, Schmidt-Rottluff suffered such extreme anxiety that he was unable to paint and devoted himself to the more therapeutic practice of carving woodblocks and wooden sculpture. Between 1917 and 1919, he devoted himself primarily to religious subjects, including The Miraculous Draught of Fishes, taken from a portfolio of woodcuts depicting scenes from the life of Christ. Other themes also appear in the artist's work. In Dunes and Pier, a depiction of Nidden, the village in East Prussia (Lithuania) on the Baltic where Schmidt-Rottluff vacationed, he expresses his belief in the enduring timelessness of nature, while Mother is typical of his monumental and direct treatment of figures at this time. In both works he took advantage of the qualities particular to woodcut, integrating the irregularity of the block, its natural grain and flat, smooth surfaces, into his compositions.","Expressionism (0.976739), Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (0.875067), Die Brcke (0.78386), Woodcut (0.660649), Degenerate art (0.595869), Fritz Bleyl (0.562087), Printmaking (0.538415), Karl Schmidt-Rottluff (0.536097)"

Throughout his career, he created editioned projects, many expressly intended to confound issues of originality and authorship.

Following his initial experimentation with Cubist painting in the early teens, Duchamp emerged as a fiercely independent figure in the Parisian and New York art worlds, encountering the Dada and Surrealist groups from time to time. Among the varied works in his oeuvre, he published three facsimile collections of his working notes.

Standing apart from the predominant developments of Pop art and Minimalism, her work anticipated the more process-oriented art of Eva Hesse and Bruce Nauman, who emerged a few years later. Her signature wall-mounted constructions consist of strips of canvas stretched over welded steel armatures in weblike arrangements surrounding a central oval void. In a groundbreaking merger of painting and sculpture, these massive, protruding-and-receding structures refer to cosmology, space travel, and the body. Despite her early success, Bontecou withdrew from the New York art scene in the early 1970s, though she continued to work. Her sculpture became less rough and aggressive as she experimented with vacuum-formed plastics to make flowerlike and fishlike forms. Drawing also became an increasingly important aspect of her artistic practice. From 1971 to 1991 she taught in the art department at Brooklyn College. Bontecou was one of a generation of artists who entered printmaking through the gentle insistence of Tatyana Grosman, founder of Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE). Between 1962 and 1982, she made more than thirty prints-mostly lithographs as well as some etchings, always in black and white and echoing the concerns of her sculpture. With very few exceptions, these were all produced at ULAE. In Second Stone, a constellation of floating voids is rendered in a softly modeled, freehand style that reflects her appreciation for lithography's proximity to drawing. For Seventh Stone, she exploited the rich blacks that are possible in lithography to create a more dramatically defined, iconic form. Although Bontecou deliberately left her sculptures and drawings untitled, keeping all interpretations open to the viewer, she used numerical titles to document her prints.","Printmaking (0.961712), Bruce Nauman (0.837813), Sculpture (0.823965), Leo Castelli (0.787823), Lee Bontecou (0.615441), Modernism (0.567981), Art (0.504603), Lithography (0.487819)"

Trained as a commercial illustrator, Ruscha had an early interest in comic books, graphic design, typography, and serial imagery that led him to produce a now landmark series of inexpensive, large-edition artist's books comprising black-and-white photographic essays on commonplace architecture and objects. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he began focusing on traditional printmaking, which has remained a consistent and vital part of his artistic practice. Working in screenprint, lithography, etching, and sometimes utilizing unconventional organic substances instead of inks, Ruscha has completed more than three hundred prints and some twenty artist's books to date. The gasoline station is Ruscha's most iconic image. He began experimenting with the subject in his first artist's book, Twentysix Gasoline Stations (1963), which reproduces a series of banal photographs the artist took while driving on Route 66 between Los Angeles and his hometown of Oklahoma City. That year, converting an otherwise ordinary locale into a dramatic, even mysterious symbol of the American vernacular landscape, Ruscha created a monumental painting titled Standard Station, Amarillo, Texas, based on one of the photographs but with a radically foreshortened composition. A few years later he made this print, further exploring the nuances of his emblematic image. Using the medium of screenprint, Ruscha was able to achieve areas of solid, flat color, as well as sinuously blended colors made with the ""split fountain"" technique, one of the first fine-art applications of this commercial process that combines differently colored inks. Reusing the screens from the print, Ruscha continued to experiment with Standard Station, and eventually varied colors and compositions to create three additional printed versions.","Printmaking (0.976437), Art (0.693385), Printing (0.562611), Twentysix Gasoline Stations (0.55278), Pop art (0.517325), Conceptual art (0.495368), Photography (0.491502), Edward Ruscha (0.488083)"

He rejected the Impressionist practice of studying effects of light on the external world and instead looked inward to explore themes of love and jealousy, loneliness and anxiety, and sickness and death. His personal history, with the premature loss of his mother and an older sister, as well as complex and unsatisfactory entanglements with women, provided him with a constant source of artistic motifs. The practices of painting, drawing, and printmaking were intertwined for Munch as he reinvestigated the same themes throughout his career. Printmaking was particularly conducive to this practice since he could save his plates, stones, and woodblocks for reuse time and again. Working with professional printers, or availing himself of a press in his studio, he explored some seven hundred fifty subjects in prints, varying his imagery in nearly thirty thousand impressions. Such experimentation can be seen in red and black examples of The Sick Child I, and in three versions of The Lonely Ones, interpreted in both woodcut and etching. Munch sometimes used the same motif in a painting and a print, and a comparison of the two shows the print to be greatly simplified, achieving a sense of essence. Complex emotions are distilled into universal symbols by removing narrative references. Woodcut, in particular, lent itself to this approach. Munch's practice of cutting his blocks like a jigsaw puzzle in order to ink them in sections also enhanced a sense of isolation and abstraction.

This revolutionary arrangement of type afforded a greater rationalism in the organization and communication of information.As director of the new printing workshop established at the Bauhaus in 1925, Bayer had sought to overturn the typography styles prevailing in the early part of the twentieth century, in particular the overly decorative typefaces of the Art Nouveau and Gothic lettering commonly used in Germany. Building on what he had learned as a Bauhaus student under László Moholy-Nagy, Bayer promoted a new form of typography, a logical and universal means of graphic expression aimed, above all, at clarity. Bayer hoped to do what he called “a thorough alphabetical house-cleaning” in all publications issued by the Bauhaus. He and other devotees of the new style discarded the art of illustration, which they found subjective, in favor of unadorned typography, photography, and the modern technique of collage.","Graphic design (0.978455), Typography (0.773629), Bauhaus (0.601717), Art Nouveau (0.494362), Typeface (0.479231), Walter Gropius (0.452783), 1920s (0.423955), Calligraphy (0.384582)"

While a prize-winning commercial artist in the 1950s, he devised a printing process of blotting outline drawings in ink from one surface to another. In a whimsical book of fashionable shoe styles, done at the time he was head of advertising at a shoe company, his blotted drawings were reproduced and then hand-colored by a team of friends. Although Warhol adopted a bland, detached persona, he was an extremely energetic artist and self-promoter who played a significant role in redirecting the course of art. Rather than deriving his work from subjective personal feelings or idealist visions for abstraction, Warhol embraced popular culture and commercial processes. He eventually set up his own print-publishing company called Factory Additions, issuing portfolios of his signature themes. For Marilyn, he created ten highly variable portraits, exploiting the possibilities in screenprinting for shifting colors and off-register effects. By celebrating the seemingly impervious veneer of glamour and fame, but acknowledging its darker inner complexity, these prints reveal Warhol's subtle grasp of American culture. Warhol did not participate in the collaborative printshop system established in America in the 1960s, but his work contributed decisively to what has been characterized as a ""print boom"" at that time. Through the course of his career, he made nearly eight hundred printed images on paper, about half published in traditional editions. He was also a surprisingly experimental printmaker, issuing hundreds of trial proofs and unique variants. The compositions that make up Camouflage, his last portfolio, constitute a playful commentary on abstraction. Through manipulation of scale and color from sheet to sheet, Warhol alters the visual impact of the military fabric used for concealment. In examples on canvas, he also superimposes his face, linking self-portraiture with disguise.","Printmaking (0.968591), Printing (0.735925), Andy Warhol (0.472942), Screen-printing (0.437751), Culture (0.342516), The Velvet Underground (0.330713), Abstraction (0.32974), Popular culture (0.322927)"

His best-known works are elongated bronze figures either standing or striding. Their isolation and often haunting qualities have been interpreted in Existential terms, most notably by the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. The figures in his signature paintings and drawings, rendered within dense webs of sketchy lines, are also enigmatic. Giacometti created more than three hundred fifty prints, two-thirds of which appear in illustrated books and are collaborations with such friends as André Breton, Georges Bataille, and René Char. He worked in etching and lithography, mainly depicting people close to him or recording studio views of his own sculptures and paintings. His most active period as a printmaker coincided with his renewed focus on painting in the 1950s, when he received invitations from a variety of publishers, including Aimé Maeght of Paris, and Kornfeld and Klipstein of Bern. His introduction to intaglio printmaking occurred in the early 1930s during a brief stay at Stanley William Hayter's Atelier 17 in Paris, an experimental workshop and celebrated meeting place for artists. The result was two highly distinctive and rare engravings related directly to his sculpture of the period. To make Cubist Head, Giacometti gouged sharp angles and parallel lines into a copperplate, creating in two dimensions a fractured and faceted face similar to that of his sculpture of the same title, issued in marble and in bronze in 1934. In the print Hands Holding a Void, Giacometti comments on another of his sculptures, here surrounding it in an atmospheric field of ink tone that reads as an isolating void, made even more eerie by the random markings left from pits and scratches on the copperplate.","Printmaking (0.985492), Sculpture (0.672738), Jean-Paul Sartre (0.639568), Pablo Picasso (0.547248), Surrealism (0.516416), Alberto Giacometti (0.503513), Friedrich Nietzsche (0.481371), Existentialism (0.474783)"

Since the pavilion was demolished when the fair was over, relatively few later audiences and architectural critics had ever seen the building except through the filter of period black-and-white photographs, and its significance became largely a matter of thirdhand debate rather than actual experience.

Kandinsky devalued recognizable subject matter, stating in an exhibition catalogue published in 1910, ""Speaking of secrets through secrets?

Established in 1948, CoBrA was a postwar European phenomenon, contemporary with Abstract Expressionism though more collaborative and politicized in its activities. While rejecting the official tenets of Surrealism, CoBrA used similar spontaneous methods to formulate individualized iconographies tied to Northern European folk art, ""primitive"" art forms, and children's drawings. Introduced to printmaking in 1944, Alechinsky studied typography, poster design, and book illustration at the National College of Architecture and Decorative Arts in Brussels. When CoBrA disbanded in 1951 he moved to Paris on a grant from the French government to study etching and engraving at Stanley William Hayter's celebrated Atelier 17. There he met Jean Clerté, a printer who became his primary collaborator. He also formed long-term relationships with other celebrated European workshops and printers, including Imprimerie Clot, Bramsen et Georges, Imprimerie Arte, and Atelier Bordas for lithography, and Valter and Elenora Rossi, Robert Dutrou, and Piero Crommelynck for etchings and engravings. He has created over eighteen hundred prints, including book illustrations, posters, and ephemeral works. One Stone, Two Passes demonstrates Alechinsky's use of framing devices, understood as both frontier and threshold, which appear frequently in his work. An encompassing black stroke gives cohesion to a set of seemingly isolated and fragmentary semifigurative images, a few of which are themselves enclosed by marked boundaries of a frame.

In every case, his sense of irony is coupled with a strikingly positive spirit.Printmaking was integral to Lichtenstein's practice from the time he was a student, and in the early 1950s he regularly entered regional print exhibitions. But it was his Pop style that attracted the professional workshops established in the 1960s, and his work was instrumental in the renaissance of American printmaking at that time. His mechanized aesthetic was particularly in keeping with the technical expertise offered at Gemini G.E.L., and his early collaborations there were undertaken with Kenneth Tyler, a printer he continued to work with at Tyler Graphics. Donald Saff, then of Graphicstudio, was another technical wizard who urged Lichtenstein to make prints. In all he created some three hundred fifty printed images, primarily with a series format that echoed his work in painting. In addition to traditional prints, he created ephemeral projects in the spirit of Pop art, like wallpaper, gift wrap, and paper plates, and also made many benefit prints and posters for social and political causes.Originally from TextEntryID 69575 (TextTypeID 127)removed the second paragraph:The subject matter that first brought Lichtenstein's work to public attention was appropriated from comic strips, but his later themes owed their visual syntax to themes from ""high"" culture, particularly the history of modern art.

His aesthetic strategy, embracing screenprint on canvas, assemblage, set design, and performance, is based on collage and juxtaposes objects and images from the everyday world to elicit their effects on each other and to stimulate an almost poetic response in the viewer. Rauschenberg's prints now number nearly one thousand, but he needed the cajoling of Tatyana Grosman to attempt printmaking, during the fledgling years of the now-renowned publisher and printer Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE). His daring use of lithography appeared early on, when the stone for Accident broke in two while he was working on it. Undeterred, he retained the diagonal white gash through the composition, recording this event. When Accident won first prize at the prestigious Ljubljana Graphic Biennial in 1963, it established Rauschenberg, ULAE, and American printmaking in the forefront as never before.Rauschenberg continues to work at ULAE. Among his projects of the 1980s was the Soviet/American Array series, created for ROCI (Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange) and including his own photographs of New York and Moscow. This undertaking, fostering cultural exchange in cities outside the usual contemporary art circuit, reflects Rauschenberg's broad interest in social causes, expressed in numerous benefit prints over the years on subjects from ecology to world peace. Among his prints from other workshops, sheer technical audacity marks those produced at Gemini G.E.L. His first project there, a self-portrait entitled Booster, was the largest hand-pulled print to date in 1967. Preview, an editioned assemblage of printed imagery and collaged paper bags on silk, epitomizes his provocative imagination and extends the definition of printmaking far beyond the traditional handheld artwork on paper.","Printmaking (0.959102), Printing (0.662402), Robert Rauschenberg (0.594077), Contemporary art (0.55378), Jasper Johns (0.480972), Modern art (0.479432), Collage (0.475688), Andy Warhol (0.456692)"

With no systematic training, he railed against prevailing notions of good taste and official culture, preferring the spontaneous energy of graffiti and the art of children and the mentally ill. In postwar Paris, Dubuffet worked in a style called l'art brut, depicting fanciful figures in everyday activities that seem irrational, given his flattened perspectives, crude drawing, and unexpected juxtapositions. Dubuffet began making prints in the mid-1940s, achieving a total output of some fifteen hundred works, many for illustrated books. In the process he revolutionized lithography. His experimentation with surface texture is visible even in the early Matière et mémoire of 1944–45 in which he scratched the lithographic stones with sandpaper, rubbed them with rags, and used other unconventional materials to achieve the varied effects he desired. Dubuffet's unorthodox approach to lithography reached its zenith with the Phenomena series of 1957–62, comprising three hundred sixty-two compositions sorted into twenty-four albums. Here, working at five different workshops he maintained for the project, he created an alternative universe that seems to capture ever-changing forces of nature. Turning an established technique of drawing with crayon and brush into an improvisational event, he sought the effects of chance and accident by impressing dirt, fruit peelings, and leaves onto his printing surfaces, dragging across burning rags, and spilling chemicals onto them. He also cut up his Phenomena compositions, reassembling elements for new works such as Carrot Nose and La Lunette farcie. Although his active engagement with printmaking ended with the Phenomena series, Dubuffet eventually worked in screenprint to capture the imagery of his final L'Hourloupe phase. This invented word signified a schematic, jigsaw-puzzle-like figuration of black outlines discovered when the artist was doodling. An early manifestation in photolithography can be seen in the small illustrated book Trémolo sur l'oeil.","Printmaking (0.955076), Drawing (0.836512), Painting (0.762376), Lithography (0.671699), Illustration (0.561035)"

The surface is a black impasto, enlivened with knife marks. A jagged red line cuts high on the canvas, and is intersected by two vertical, irregular, pointed shapes before plunging downward to the bottom edge. The size of paintings like this one, its largely empty expanse, and the lightning-bolt quality of Still's line have led some to see in his work a vision of the broad spaces of the Western prairies, where he grew up. But he himself believed that such associations only diminished his work. Still commanded a new kind of abstraction, free from decipherable symbols. The tarry surface of Painting 1944-N concentrates attention on itself, denying the illusion of depth, and the intensely saturated hue carries emotional force without relying on associative imagery. More programmatically than any of the other Abstract Expressionists, Still consciously tried to erase any traces of modern European art from his painting, and to develop a new art appropriate to the New World.

Through his involvement with this group, he spearheaded radical thinking about art and mass media that fostered the development of a Pop aesthetic on both sides of the Atlantic. Paolozzi has obsessively collected vast quantities of printed ephemera—from pulp books and magazines to engineering diagrams and weaving patterns—which served as the basis for his many collages. Although he has worked in nearly all of the printmaking techniques, and completed several hundred printed works as well as some illustrated books, he has made a particular contribution in the screenprint medium, which he revolutionized in his translations of these collages into printed art. In the 1960s, Paolozzi's experimental approach with his longstanding printer Christopher Prater of Kelpra Studio, and later with Chris Betambeau of Advanced Graphics, played a significant role in overturning established ideas about originality and collaboration in printmaking. In the 1970s and 1980s he also worked extensively in etching using an abstracted vocabulary that appeared simultaneously in prints and relief sculptures. Among the earliest examples of Pop printmaking in England, As Is When is Paolozzi's homage to the Viennese philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose texts are judiciously excerpted on each of the book's screenprints. Wittgenstein's study of linguistic systems coincided with Paolozzi's fascination with games and influenced his approach to the repetition and juxtaposition of elements in his own vocabulary. Despite the abstract qualities of Tortured Life, the imagery clearly suggests the cinema as spools of film cascade from boxlike cameras. Paolozzi had made two films himself in the early 1950s, and Wittgenstein was a known enthusiast of American popular films.","Printmaking (0.964527), Vienna (0.57099), Printing (0.511465), Sren Kierkegaard (0.503251), Screen-printing (0.491406), Art (0.447473), Sculpture (0.444963), Metaphysics (0.423329)"

Hollein used machine technology—sparkplug, boxcar, and, here, aircraft carrier—to create a pure, absolute architecture with no identifiable architectonic style. Hollein followed Aircraft Carrier City in Landscape with a group of site photographs in 1964, dispensing with buildings altogether and declaring the forms of the land itself to be architectural statements—proof of his statement that “everything is architecture.” Related to this ironic, politicized viewpoint, the aircraft carrier is for Hollein an iconoclastic relic of its former function; its use here confounds common understandings of what it means to build in the contemporary landscape.","Urban planning (0.932638), Construction (0.840974), Aircraft carrier (0.789172), Architecture (0.72332), Landscape (0.721209), Germany (0.676279), 1888 (0.661491), Function (0.6338)"

This fantastic collage registers Hollein's dissatisfaction with the architectural status quo of the early 1960s  and invites speculations about the future of architecture. Declaring all forms of architecture, even the vocabulary of modernism, to be inadequate, Hollein drew upon the consumer products of science and technology to create images he believed appropriate to the times.While Hollein's transformations of commonplace objects and the landscape in a number of photomontages have certain parallels with Pop art, he shared the larger concerns of polemical architects, such as his countryman Walter Pichler and members of the British group Archigram. The imaginary proposals for buildings, cities, and services made in the early 1960s by Hollein and other visionary architects anticipated the radical, often utopian, statements of the Italian groups Archizoom Associati and Superstudio toward the end of the 1960s, a decade that culminated in cultural upheavals throughout much of the world. By this time, however, Hollein was redirecting his focus. In interiors and buildings of the late 1960s and the 1970s, he included references to historical Viennese architecture while continuing to juxtapose the built and the natural landscape.","Modernism (0.98891), Architecture (0.93588)"

Kahn explained that he conceived its design ""in recognition of the realizations that science laboratories are studios and that the air to breathe should be away from the air to throw away."" By placing the ""servant"" spaces—stairs, elevators, and air-handling towers—on the periphery, Kahn was also able to provide the ""served"" spaces—the laboratories—maximum flexibility by means of their uninterrupted floor areas.

Frustrated with his attempts at writing poetry in German, Kandinsky used these woodcuts to give shape to the nostalgia for his Russian homeland that he found impossible to put into words. As he explained to his companion, painter Gabriele Münter, ""I must do them, for I cannot rid myself of my thoughts (or possibly dreams) any other way."" The imagery in these prints was central to the symbolic vocabulary that appeared throughout Kandinsky's work. Five of the woodcuts repeat previous compositions, and Kandinsky returned to five others in later prints and paintings. Most significantly, Kandinsky used the horse and rider motif, his symbol of a warrior for new art, for the first time here. Kandinsky saw the woodcut medium as being akin to lyric poetry: both forms demanded concentration on the essential. Woodcut pushed him to simplify his imagery; his undulating lines and decorative patterns are in fact potent symbols of longing.

At London's Royal College of Art in the early 1960s, he worked in a style that combined figuration, abstraction, and text, which identified him with the British Pop art movement. His work, however, defies categorization. It consists of still lifes and portraits rendered with delicacy and frankness and, after moving to Los Angeles, has included bold, colorful images of California's sun-drenched settings. Rooted in his personal relationships, his homosexuality, and his literary interests and travels, Hockney's art is, above all, deeply autobiographical. Printmaking has played a central role in Hockney's practice, and many of his most significant early works take the form of narrative print series. The linearity of etching matches his natural inclination for drawing, and lithography allows him to explore dazzling color. He has also made editions with paper pulp and inventive prints using a photocopy machine. In all Hockney has created more than five hundred prints, collaborating with celebrated printers and workshops in Europe and America and also experimenting on his own. The artist's initial trip to New York, in 1961, inspired his first major group of etchings, A Rake's Progress, which reinterprets the famous cycle of eighteenth-century engravings by William Hogarth. With great wit and candor, Hockney's ""rake"" (himself) is a young artist and gay man struggling to find his way in New York. A few years later, after settling in Los Angeles, he completed a series of lithographs entitled A Hollywood Collection, which reflects the city's artificial beauty.

More delicate, and more clearly marked by human artifice, are the work's sloping plane of walnut, its painted wood ball, and its two steel rods balancing a crescent and a sphere, respectively. Gibraltar recalls the biomorphic forms in Surrealist art, particularly that of Joan Miró, a strong influence on Calder. But there is also a poetic whimsy that is Calder's alone.The sculpture is contradictory in its qualities. The rods are thin and linear, and express an upward, airborne drive and eccentric balance; the lignum vitae is heavy, earth-hugging, solid. The surfaces, too, show various materials being variously treated, implying methods from machine-making to hand-polishing to leaving well enough alone. These disjunctions have a good-humored wit, which does not disguise the work's grace. Calder once said that ""the underlying sense of form"" in his work was ""the system of the Universe,"" and Gibraltar, with its sun, moon, and heavy earth, is a solar system in miniature-a system revealed as a fine-tuned balance of opposites.","Solar System (0.917348), Mass (0.868314), Force (0.754317), Sun (0.75297), Universe (0.735341), Earth (0.677604), Sculpture (0.664142), Sphere (0.627361)"

The Benday dots and regularized stripes he used for tone, the clarifying black outlines, the flat areas of bold primary color, and the simplification and schematization of his compositions are all elements embraced by consumer culture to create the inescapable printed imagery aimed at mass audiences. The subject matter that first brought Lichtenstein's work to public attention was appropriated from comic strips, but his later themes owed their visual syntax to themes from ""high"" culture, particularly the history of modern art...like Germany Expressionism and Art Deco, as well as the time-honored motif of landscape in art. In every case, his sense of irony is coupled with a strikingly positive spirit. Printmaking was integral to Lichtenstein's practice from the time he was a student, and in the early 1950s he regularly entered regional print exhibitions. But it was his Pop style that attracted the professional workshops established in the 1960s, and his work was instrumental in the renaissance of American printmaking at that time. His mechanized aesthetic was particularly in keeping with the technical expertise offered at Gemini G.E.L., and his early collaborations there were undertaken with Kenneth Tyler, a printer he continued to work with at Tyler Graphics. Donald Saff, then of Graphicstudio, was another technical wizard who urged Lichtenstein to make prints. In all he created some three hundred fifty printed images, primarily with a series format that echoed his work in painting. In addition to traditional prints, he created ephemeral projects in the spirit of Pop art, like wallpaper, gift wrap, and paper plates, and also made many benefit prints and posters for social and political causes.","Roy Lichtenstein (0.979835), Printing (0.935857), Pop art (0.930453), United States (0.806288), Andy Warhol (0.667301), Modern art (0.63111), Printmaking (0.591942), Modernism (0.559307)"

Motherwell did not become a full-time artist until 1941 and, with his academic background, was often cast in the role of the intellectual of the New York School. In that year, at Schapiro's behest, artist Kurt Seligmann invited Motherwell to study etching in his studio. So began Motherwell's long and fruitful printmaking career, which consisted of more than four hundred editioned prints, and established him as Abstract Expressionism's most prolific and dedicated printmaker. Through Seligmann, who had come to America in 1939, Motherwell met other exiled European artists, many of them Surrealists, and began to adopt their idea of ""pure psychic automatism,"" the process of letting uncontrolled drawing initiate the structure of a composition. Working in this intuitive mode led to the creation of a vocabulary of recurring abstract motifs, most often executed in black and white, that Motherwell would draw upon throughout his career. One such motif, two ovals compressed within a triangle, was first used by the artist in 1943 and appears in this plate from Madrid Suite, one of twenty-five prints created by the artist during a 1965–66 collaboration with printer Irwin Hollander. For this series, one of many works with a Spanish theme, Motherwell recalled an experience he had while honeymooning in Madrid with Helen Frankenthaler in 1958. He had pinned drawing paper on the hotel walls and liked the way the texture of the wall transferred itself to the sheets as he drew. To re-create this experience, Motherwell taped transfer paper to the spackled walls of Hollander's studio and rubbed the sheets with lithographic crayons to achieve the desired transfer of texture.","Abstract expressionism (0.972877), Robert Motherwell (0.699857), Helen Frankenthaler (0.622508), Hans Hofmann (0.574217), Clement Greenberg (0.569742), New York School (0.566481), Lyrical Abstraction (0.550928), Color Field (0.54828)"

The space  of the house is defined by its roof and floor planes, the whole supported by eight steel columns. All the steel elements are painted white. The architect claimed: ""We should strive to bring Nature, houses, and people together into a higher unity. When one looks at Nature through the glass walls of the Farnsworth House it takes on a deeper significance than when one stands outside. More of Nature is thus expressed— it becomes part of a greater whole.""Set in a meadow overlooking the Fox River, which is prone to flooding, the house is elevated above the ground. Aesthetically, this contributes to the effect of weightlessness, reinforced by the cantilevered roof and floor planes and by the asymmetrical placement of the two travertine terraces that imply an infinite extension into space.

It was based on the untried idea that a supporting steel skeleton would be able to free the exterior walls from their load-bearing function, allowing a building to have a surface more translucent than solid. A number of American skyscrapers had featured expanses of glass, but Mies was the first to imagine such a building without a structural or decorative frame of masonry. Indeed Mies seems to have been inspired by photographs of American skyscrapers when they were still under construction, a stage that he felt revealed ""the bold constructive thoughts, and then the impression of the high-reaching steel skeletons is overpowering."" Mies developed his radical proposal in response to a call for German architects to design Berlin's first skyscraper, intended for a triangular site bounded by the Spree River, the busy shopping street Friedrichstrasse, and the train station of the same name. The competition drew 140 entries as well as intense interest from architects, artists, and the general public, generating debate about the future of the city and representing hopes for new beginnings after Germany's defeat in World War I. While Mies's bold image of an entirely steel-and-glass skyscraper had a solid scientific and technological basis, his crystal-shaped plan reflected the more fantastic visions of Expressionist architects and artists, who were drawn to glass as a symbol of purity and renewal. This very large drawing was repeatedly reproduced in publications around the world, achieving iconic status. In 1964, the architect, who had left it behind when he emigrated to the United States in 1938, was able to retrieve it from what was then East Germany, and it has been exhibited frequently at The Museum of Modern Art since then.

Scott Fitzgerald. Trying to merge his roots with his culture of adoption, he longed for an architecture that would combine American technology and energy with French humanism and sophistication. He was indeed instrumental in introducing European modern architecture to the United States, and also in bringing American flair and taste for the spectacular to France. After taking his license at the Ècole des Beaux-Arts in 1927, Nelson became a member of the School of Paris, the eclectic group of modernist architects that also included Robert Mallet-Stevens. His project for the Palais de la Découverte, represented in this perspective drawing, arose after the scientific exhibit at Paris's 1937 International Exposition greatly impressed authorities in the French government. As a result, Nelson and his colleagues Oscar Nitzchke and Frantz Jourdain were commissioned to produce a study for a permanent science museum in the city. The project, unfortunately never realized, envisioned a structure that was as functional as it was monumental, the outer envelope being designed to contain diverse exhibits with quite different spatial needs. Tensile cables anchored in the central ovoid shell support the circular cantilevered roof. The architects"" ideals and aspirations are evident in the clear lines of the drawing, which portrays a building for a positivist, technocratic institution.","Ernest Hemingway (0.971275), F.

In 1955 he moved to New York, attending the Art Students League and later working as a Times Square billboard painter and as a window-display designer. Initially creating canvases in an Abstract Expressionist mode, Rosenquist dramatically shifted his style in the late 1950s to mimic his slick billboard work. His fragmented images, of an exaggerated scale and with Pop-culture references, quickly identified him as a leading proponent of Pop art. Having worked independently in larger-than-life formats, Rosenquist did not naturally take to the intimate scale and technical processes of traditional printmaking. But spurred on by publisher Tatyana Grosman of the newly founded Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE) in the early 1960s, he made imposing, experimental lithographs using airbrushes, wallpaper rollers, stencils, and the commercial color-separation process. In the coming decades, collaborating with innovative workshops that embraced new materials and approaches—Styria Studio, Graphicstudio, Gemini G.E.L., and Tyler Graphics among them—Rosenquist created prints of unprecedented scale and ambition, including multipanel installations. He has completed more than three hundred prints to date. Campaign, one of Rosenquist's earliest published prints, typifies the artist's strategy of combining unrelated images and colors that are ambiguous in meaning but unexpectedly unified in composition. With both commercial and political underpinnings, Campaign includes fragments from a painting that the artist produced for an anti-Vietnam War demonstration. The Kleenex boxes, salt shaker, and floral wallpaper design are symbols of consumer culture. The more subtle depiction of a military uniform being sprinkled with salt—the artist's allusion to the tale about peacefully capturing a bird by sprinkling salt on its tail—suggests a nonviolent alternative to war. The title Campaign, in addition to its military association, refers to the artist's twenty-day stay at ULAE to complete this print.","Art Students League of New York (0.970534), Printmaking (0.954037), Pop art (0.888501), James Rosenquist (0.87431), Andy Warhol (0.742758), Modernism (0.613156), Collage (0.612627), Printing (0.603797)"

Basing the piece on the shoulder-bone structure of a male torso, Moore actually made a simplified skeleton. The shapes of bones fascinated Moore. He was also one of the many artists of his generation who wanted to escape the classical tradition—in his words, to remove ""the Greek spectacles from the eyes of the modern sculptor""—and who therefore studied objects of many eras and areas, from Cycladic art to pre-Columbian art to the African and Oceanic art of relatively recent times. ""Keep ever prominent the world tradition-the big view of Sculpture,"" Moore once wrote, and the near-abstract forms of his art show how far he left classical naturalism behind.In its scale and weight, Large Torso evokes a natural form—perhaps an arch of wind-smoothed rock. The word Arch in the work's title also asks viewers to look at that central vacancy, as important formally as the solid bronze.

Some claim he made as many as twenty thousand prints during his career, a number difficult to ascertain because of his many followers. Most of his prints took the form of relief engravings printed for mass distribution as broadsheets, posters, and cartoons, among other popular formats. Posada apprenticed in a lithography workshop while still in his teens and soon was running his own commercial shop in León de los Aldamas, Guanajuato. After selling this establishment and moving to Mexico City in 1888, he joined the shop of Antonio Vanegas Arroyo, where he worked until his death. Arroyo was a master of the popular ""penny"" print, distributing broadsheets to the working classes, including Posada's ejemplos (examples), works drawn from sensational news items and published as a means of improving the morals of the people. During the tumultuous years leading up to the Mexican Revolution of 1910, Posada relentlessly commented on the leading political and social issues of his day, satirizing everyone and anything. The most recurrent theme in his prints, the calavera (skull), was probably invented by his contemporary Manuel Manilla, but Posada popularized it as a national icon. This symbol, commemorating Mexico's celebration of the Day of the Dead, became for Posada a sentimental and ironic character embodying the repressed urges of society and reflecting his preoccupation with mortality.

Intellectual speculation is integral to each drawing, and architectural critics have called them ""visual poems"". These two drawings from Abraham's Linear City series demonstrate his enduring fascination with the city, its eternal fluctuations and mechanistic foundations. Along with works by his fellow Austrians Walter Pichler and Hans Hollein, they were featured in the Museum's 1967 exhibition Architectural Fantasies: Drawings from the Museum's Collection, which focused on projects that relied on the machine not as a source of inspiration for design but as a basis for civilization. The works conjure up images of missile sites and giant engineering installations. They are devoid of people: for Abraham, ""Architectural scale can no longer be based on the physical measurement of the human body, but has to be based on the new perception media, on all the senses, on dreams."" Glacier City is almost invisible in its location, between the walls of a valley and beneath a membrane suspended above it to serve as a protective shield and a collector of solar energy. The part of it we see suggests a gunboat. The city's growth in its underground cavity is horizontal and linear rather than vertical; like arteries running through a living body, streets, transportation lines, and the sewer system are the functioning architectural passages. Similarly with Universal City, we seem to gaze out of a window onto a ""settlement"" strip that disappears into the horizon. This megastructure or artificial valley has the potential for infinite growth and universal applicability—it could form a ring around the globe. For Abraham the horizon is an architectural site, an idea influenced by the Viennese philosopher Ernest Mach and his theory of collision: the site of collision in Abraham's work is the meeting of earth and sky. ""Building"" for Abraham can mean to build with words as well as with lines, or volume, or concrete. Each is a reality and each is autonomous, as each has its own expression. As Abraham has said, ""Even the principle of drawing reveals the origin of architecture—the act of interfering in, and shaping, space.

With no systematic training, he railed against prevailing notions of good taste and official culture, preferring the spontaneous energy of graffiti and the art of children and the mentally ill. In postwar Paris, Dubuffet worked in a style called l'art brut, depicting fanciful figures in everyday activities that seem irrational, given his flattened perspectives, crude drawing, and unexpected juxtapositions. Dubuffet began making prints in the mid-1940s, achieving a total output of some fifteen hundred works, many for illustrated books. In the process he revolutionized lithography. His experimentation with surface texture is visible even in the early Matière et mémoire of 1944-45 in which he scratched the lithographic stones with sandpaper, rubbed them with rags, and used other unconventional materials to achieve the varied effects he desired. Dubuffet's unorthodox approach to lithography reached its zenith with the Phenomena series of 1957-62, comprising three hundred sixty-two compositions sorted into twenty-four albums. Here, working at five different workshops he maintained for the project, he created an alternative universe that seems to capture ever-changing forces of nature. Turning an established technique of drawing with crayon and brush into an improvisational event, he sought the effects of chance and accident by impressing dirt, fruit peelings, and leaves onto his printing surfaces, dragging across burning rags, and spilling chemicals onto them. He also cut up his Phenomena compositions, reassembling elements for new works such as Carrot Nose and La Lunette farcie. Although his active engagement with printmaking ended with the Phenomena series, Dubuffet eventually worked in screenprint to capture the imagery of his final L'Hourloupe phase. This invented word signified a schematic, jigsaw-puzzle-like figuration of black outlines discovered when the artist was doodling. An early manifestation in photolithography can be seen in the small illustrated book Trémolo sur l'oeil.","Printmaking (0.955076), Drawing (0.836512), Painting (0.762376), Lithography (0.671699), Illustration (0.561035)"

Between 1912 and 1974, he made more than five hundred lithographs, etchings, and linoleum cuts, many of which appeared as book illustrations. In Let There Be Fashion, Down with Art, Ernst's first major print project, he mapped out many of the motifs of his later work and also paid homage to the imaginary tableaux of Giorgio de Chirico. In a revolt against Expressionist printmaking, Ernst drew elements culled from commonplace printed advertisements onto a lithographic stone using a gestureless mechanical line. The anti-art sentiment reflected in this style, and the phrase ""Down with Art,"" express the spirit of both nihilism and nonsense that was a pervasive aspect of Dada activities in Cologne at the time. Encouraged by Surrealist poet Paul Éluard, Ernst moved from Cologne to Paris in 1922. Exploring the practice of many painters and poets who wished to plumb the unconscious as a source for their art, Ernst experimented with the semiautomatic process of frottage—rubbings made from textured objects or surfaces. The patterns and textures generated by such rubbings were the starting point for his images, as seen in the portfolio Histoire Naturelle. Ernst also collaborated with poets, including André Breton, Tristan Tzara, and others, by providing illustrations for their texts. In 1929 he made his first ""collage novel,"" incorporating a technique central to his experiments with the effects of chance. He created a series of collages with imagery culled from nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century pulp novels, scientific journals, and natural-history magazines and arranged them in a sequence as pages. He then printed these collages by photomechanical means to transform them into the seamless images he desired. Like popular serial stories, Ernst released Une Semaine de bonté in the form of five consecutive volumes that evoke erotic violence and intrigue, as well as humor.","Surrealism (0.967003), Max Ernst (0.589685), Dada (0.578607), Andr Breton (0.552811), Tristan Tzara (0.537182), Anti-art (0.46289), Printmaking (0.419676), Modernism (0.408268)"

Cubism was a radical new style being created by these two artists as a collaborative effort, and this style is evident in Fox, a café still life in which Braque used the drypoint technique to fragment the forms by means of short, spontaneous, staccato lines and cross-hatchings. Textual components such as the word ""FOX"" make reference to an English-style bar frequented by the Cubist poets and painters, while ""Old Tom Gin"" refers to the central motif of the still life, a bottle of gin. Other recognizable elements—a tabletop and drawer, a playing card with a heart, and numbers that could refer to the slang term ""75,"" for cheating at dice, or ""15"" centimes in a saucer—are also found in some contemporaneous, related paintings by Braque. In all, Braque made ten prints in the Cubist style, of which only Fox and one other were published in editions at the time. (The other eight prints were issued in the 1950s, when there was a greater demand for Braque's work.) The artist resumed printmaking in the 1930s, at which time his subjects reflected the influence of Surrealism. A prime example is the book Théogonie, in which Braque used an arabesque etched line that reflects the automatic drawing of the Surrealists. In the last decades of his life, printmaking continued to interest him. Of the three hundred printed compositions he created, primarily in his later years, nearly two hundred were for illustrated books.","Pablo Picasso (0.943013), Cubism (0.893675), Georges Braque (0.570203), Printmaking (0.53963), Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (0.487374), Collage (0.471924), Surrealism (0.418066), Juan Gris (0.406735)"

After working and exhibiting in Paris from 1910 to 1914, Chagall returned to Russia, where he remained until 1922. There he formed friendships with Russian avant-garde poets and painters and worked toward creating a modern Jewish art through his journal illustrations, children's books, and designs for the Jewish State Theater. Chagall was introduced to printmaking in Berlin in 1922, at the age of thirty-five. (He would eventually complete one hundred twenty-three intaglios and woodcuts, more than eleven hundred lithographs, and thirty-eight illustrated books.) He had arrived there with an autobiographical manuscript he had been working on since 1911. The gallerist Paul Cassirer saw the text, My Life, and hoped to publish a translation of it that would include prints by Chagall. Responding immediately to this new medium of printmaking, the artist completed his first etchings within three weeks. They were issued as a portfolio without text, due to translation difficulties with Chagall's unusual prose. Drawing on vivid childhood memories of village life in Vitebsk, the artist depicted himself, his wife and child, his parents, his childhood home, local figures such as the teacher of the Talmud, and events that had taken place there. These scenes of life in Russia were still fresh in Chagall's mind in 1923, when he began the etchings for Nikolai Gogol's novel Les Âmes mortes, the classic Russian text that was to be his first book collaboration with the renowned publisher Ambroise Vollard. A notorious perfectionist, Vollard left twenty-five unfinished projects at the time of his death in 1939, including Les Âmes mortes. The volume was later completed in 1948 by Tériade, another of the great twentieth-century publishers of illustrated books.","Marc Chagall (0.966923), Vitebsk Museum of Modern Art (0.891304), Russian avant-garde (0.854953), Printmaking (0.826704), Drawing (0.784644), El Lissitzky (0.772009), Nikolai Gogol (0.769107), Vitebsk (0.753)"

Kokoschka planned to use it as his contribution to the artist Franz Marc's unrealized plans for an illustrated Bible. The illustrations show Kokoschka turning to a naturalistic style, and pulse with an energy suited to the unpredictable narrative. In Kokoschka's burlesque interpretation of the biblical story, man is tested by woman, not God. The artist inserts many autobiographical elements of his passionate but ill-fated affair with Alma Mahler, who had left him and shortly thereafter married architect Walter Gropius.

Kokoschka instead delivered a haunting poem about awakening adolescent sexuality set on far-off islands, away from the modern city and bourgeois life. His carefully composed text alluded to classical and contemporary literature by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Viennese writer Peter Altenberg. Kokoschka dedicated the volume to artist Gustav Klimt, from whom he borrowed the square format for the images, which push the text to the margins. The stylized patterning in Kokoschka's lithographs is typical of the dominant decorative approach in fin-de-siècle Vienna, and show his confident assimilation of various ""primitivist"" currents in European art, such as in the cloisonné-like outlines, unconventional perspective, and flat planes of color.PUBLICATION HISTORYThe book debuted at the monumental Kunstschau exhibition in Vienna in 1908. The original printer, who worked with another publisher of a famous series of children's books, backed out upon seeing Kokoschka's proofs.

In this interpretation, Judith, a chaste widow, saves her people by beheading the sleeping Holofernes, whose army has besieged her city, Bethulia. Corinth's sensuous use of color heightens the narrative's emotional power and theatricality. In the key scene, Corinth places Judith, blade raised above Holofernes, in front of a blood-red curtain. In an illustration titled Victory Dance, a red-headed woman leads a group of revelers in ecstatic celebration of the freedom gained through Judith's bloody act.

Cubism was a radical new style being created by these two artists as a collaborative effort, and this style is evident in Fox, a café still life in which Braque used the drypoint technique to fragment the forms by means of short, spontaneous, staccato lines and cross-hatchings. Textual components such as the word ""FOX"" make reference to an English-style bar frequented by the Cubist poets and painters, while ""Old Tom Gin"" refers to the central motif of the still life, a bottle of gin. Other recognizable elements—a tabletop and drawer, a playing card with a heart, and numbers that could refer to the slang term ""75,"" for cheating at dice, or ""15"" centimes in a saucer—are also found in some contemporaneous, related paintings by Braque. In all, Braque made ten prints in the Cubist style, of which only Fox and one other were published in editions at the time. (The other eight prints were issued in the 1950s, when there was a greater demand for Braque's work.) The artist resumed printmaking in the 1930s, at which time his subjects reflected the influence of Surrealism. A prime example is the book Théogonie, in which Braque used an arabesque etched line that reflects the automatic drawing of the Surrealists.

PUBLISHING HISTORYThe play's single performance at the Kunstschau exhibition in summer 1909 cemented Kokoschka's reputation as Vienna's wildest young artist. Shortly thereafter, his friend and supporter Adolf Loos introduced him to important Berlin dealer and publisher Herwarth Walden. Walden began promoting Kokoschka's work in Germany and printed several of the artist's drawings in his influential Expressionist periodical, Der Sturm. In 1916, Walden's Verlag Der Sturm published this illustrated book, combining Kokoschka's play with reproductions of related drawings (including four that had appeared in the periodical). Kokoschka hand-colored the reproductions in three copies; of these three, two are now in the Museum's collection.

The required stones, plates, and screens, as well as the proofing process itself, have served to facilitate his use and reuse of imagery in new contexts. Such alterations and metamorphosis have allowed Johns to continually forge new meanings for his evolving artistic vocabulary, not only in printmaking but also in painting and drawing, mediums that, for him, are all deeply intertwined. Johns is of the generation that led to a renaissance of printmaking in America, and he has worked at several printshops that were established in this period. Having created some four hundred printed works in the course of his career, in addition to countless working proofs and evolving states, he carefully organizes this body of work in a personal archive that documents his creative process. The technique of lithography is primary for him, but he has also worked extensively in etching and other intaglio processes. In addition, sustained periods of screenprint and monotype activity have led to substantial achievements.  Currently, he has his own press, making printmaking easier and more convenient. From early images like Target and Ale Cans, to enigmatic abstractions and collagelike figurative compositions, Johns has forged an individualized style that is difficult to categorize among the movements of contemporary art. His early placement in a transitional period between Abstract Expressionism and Pop art lost significance as his work unfolded. Yet an underlying emotional and intellectual resonance has remained constant throughout. His probing imagery invites introspection in almost poetic terms of reference, suggestion, and allegory.

After World War I, he became increasingly interested in non-traditional mediums, making murals, designing tapestries, costumes, and theater and film sets, and eventually completing a film in 1924. He turned to book illustration and graphic design in this spirit, completing his first book project in 1918. Originally conceived as a screenplay by Blaise Cendrars, La Fin du monde was instead published as a novel when funding for the movie fell through. The story is a satire in which God, in the guise of a cigar-smoking American businessman, promotes an apocalyptic war on earth as entertainment for the god Mars. In the book format, Léger's illustrations become integral to conveying the filmic progression of the text. Amid his illustrations, Léger includes fragments of Cendrars's text as boldly colored stenciled and block letters, inspired by his love of street signs and silent-movie titles. His dynamic, fractured compositions create a simulation of the moving images of film as the pages of the book are turned.","Cubism (0.949315), World War II (0.856989), Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (0.850513), Montparnasse (0.846159), Graphic design (0.828707), Blaise Cendrars (0.797993), Film (0.780521), World War I (0.770129)"

Beckmann included his own self-portrait in two of the prints: in one he appears with his family; in the other, he is seen groping a prostitute. In the years near the end and immediately following World War I, his most prolific period of printmaking, Beckmann began using Expressionist pictorial strategies, which earlier he had criticized, to convey his increasing disillusionment with the war. Distorted figures and cramped spaces heightened the emotional intensity of his images. PUBLISHING HISTORYBeckmann met Edschmid through Ugi Battenberg, an old friend from his student days in Weimar and whose studio he used in Frankfurt while recovering from his mental breakdown during World War I. After Die Fürstin, Beckmann and Edschmid continued collaborating. In 1918, Beckmann contributed to Edschmid's volume of artists' statements, Schöpferische Konfession (Creative credo). The following year, he joined the progressive artists' group Darmstadt Secession, which Edschmid had organized.Their publisher, Gustav Kiepenheuer in Weimar, wrote in a letter to a friend, ""Beckmann and KE—I don't like either of them, but they are current.""

This was the appellation he, Henri Matisse, Maurice de Vlaminck, and others came to be known by due to their highly experimental use of sharply contrasting colors in bright hues applied with spontaneous brushstrokes. During these same years, Derain and other Fauve artists achieved similarly striking, emotive effects in prints by exploiting stark contrasts between the white paper and the black ink. In his woodcuts of this period, Derain cut out the blocks so that heavy outlines mark the boundaries of flat, simplified shapes and linear patterns. Derain's illustrations for L'Enchanteur pourrissant, a prose poem by Guillaume Apollinaire, clearly show how the artist's interest in both African carvings and the woodcuts of Paul Gauguin informed his woodcut technique. His bold figures evoke the text but are not tied directly to it. While this approach represents a departure from traditional illustrations, the layout of blocks of text, page-sized prints, decorative elements, and illuminated letters all hark back to elements in early printed books. This combination of traditional and modernist components appeared again in 1943, when Derain created Pantagruel with publisher Albert Skira and master printer Roger Lacourière. Here Derain uses the white-line woodcut technique colored with the hand application of inks on a single block, a process known as à la poupée. The imagery he uses to depict scenes from this ribald sixteenth-century satire by François Rabelais resembles early playing cards. Among the six hundred printed works Derain made in the course of his career, nearly half served as book illustrations. In addition to woodcut, he exploited the expressive potential of a wide range of intaglio and planographic techniques in his prints.","Fauvism (0.952198), Henri Matisse (0.927991), Guillaume Apollinaire (0.688954), Andr Derain (0.686221), Woodcut (0.630697), Paul Gauguin (0.625575), Maurice de Vlaminck (0.515435), Pablo Picasso (0.514041)"

The democratic nature of printmaking was therefore ideally suited to Bonnard, as the multiple impressions of a print could be experienced by a relatively broad audience. Additionally, he benefited from technical innovations in color lithography, his primary print medium, which had led to renewed interest in printmaking in the 1890s. Bonnard created more than one hundred twenty editioned projects between 1891 and 1947, including designs for theater programs, exhibition announcements, sheet music, book and journal illustration, and individual prints. His first poster commission, an advertisement for champagne, appeared in 1891 and was an immediate success. This was eventually followed by nine other posters, including this one for La Revue blanche, a Parisian periodical that published work by avant-garde writers and included prints by contemporary artists. This and Bonnard's other posters bear many of the same design hallmarks: unmodulated color, a playful depiction of flattened space, and a decorative handling of silhouettes and textures. A similar treatment of form and space is visible in The Little Laundry Girl, which depicts one of the thousands of women and girls employed by the Parisian laundry industry. It was one of twenty-two prints by various artists included in a portfolio issued by the renowned Parisian publisher Ambroise Vollard. Bonnard's other projects with Vollard included Parallèlement, one of six books illustrated by the artist. Bonnard's masterful integration of his sensual lithographs with Paul Verlaine's erotic love poems has made Parallèlement a seminal example of the deluxe livre de peintre.","Printing (0.971601), Ukiyo-e (0.924364), Lithography (0.887148), Woodcut (0.862985), Les Nabis (0.818909), Aesthetics (0.799536), Woodblock printing (0.775656), Pierre Bonnard (0.743055)"

In the woodcuts Kandinsky veiled his subject matter, creating increasingly indecipherable images (though the horse and rider, his symbol for overcoming objective representation, runs through as a leitmotif). This process proved crucial for the development of abstraction in his art. Kandinsky said his choice of media sprang from an ""inner necessity"" for expression: the woodcuts were not merely illustrative, nor were the poems purely verbal descriptions. Kandinsky sought a synthesis of the arts, in which meaning was created through the interaction of, and space between, text and image, sound and meaning, mark and blank space. The experimental typography shows his interest in the physical aspects of the book.PUBLISHING HISTORYKlänge is one of three major publications by Kandinsky that appeared shortly before World War I, alongside Über die Geistige in der Kunst (Concerning the Spiritual in Art) and the Blaue Reiter almanac, which he edited with one of the group's cofounders, Franz Marc. Fearing poor sales, Munich-based Reinhard Piper only reluctantly published Klänge, and Kandinsky had to guarantee the production costs. More than two years after its release, Klänge had sold fewer than 120 copies. The planned Russian version never materialized. The publication was nevertheless influential on other avant-garde artists, and Futurists in Russia and Dadaists in Zurich recited and published some of the poems.","Franz Marc (0.955075), Wassily Kandinsky (0.863078), Der Blaue Reiter (0.83304), Expressionism (0.750813), Munich (0.690158), Russia (0.569289), Neue Knstlervereinigung Mnchen (0.499251), Paul Klee (0.497019)"

Picasso's early prints reflect his evolving artistic language and his place within the major modern movements. The Frugal Repast, of 1904, in a richly inked proof from the shop of printer Auguste Delâtre, evokes a sense of mystery and nobility surrounding poverty, recalling the Symbolist aesthetic of Picasso's Blue and Rose periods. Two years later, a woodcut of his companion, Fernande Olivier, betrays the simplified forms he found in Iberian sculpture and a raw expressionism inspired by tribal art. Picasso's illustrations for Saint Matorel, with text by his friend Max Jacob, incorporate the Cubist idiom with which he is most closely associated. While this abstracted language of forms served him throughout his career, his work remained aligned with figurative imagery. In his great prints of the 1930s, created in collaboration with master printer Roger Lacourière, his allegorical inclinations are revealed, while these works also share Surrealist preoccupations with the unconscious. Well into his later years, Picasso remained open to the potential of a new technique. He discovered lithography in the 1940s, at the workshop of Fernand Mourlot in Paris. One monumental series created there, Woman in an Armchair, exists in thirty experimental variations. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he was stimulated by the possibilities of linoleum cut under the tutelage of Hidalgo Arnéra, a printer whose shop was near his studio in southern France. Innovations continued, as evidenced by the one-block process he devised for color printing, seen here in the striking Still Life with Glass under the Lamp.","Pablo Picasso (0.978764), Printmaking (0.961112), Printing (0.799202), Cubism (0.680504), Lithography (0.674918), Georges Braque (0.626486), Symbolism (0.574436), Sculpture (0.53908)"

This panoramic elevation, rendered in Kahn's favorite medium of charcoal on yellow tracing paper, portrays the final version of the Institute on its dramatic site: an expansive, irregular landscape on coastal bluffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. On the right or eastern edge, amid a grove of trees, low-lying laboratories hug the land. On the western edge of the site the so-called Meeting House perches on the bluff. Inspired in part by his admiration of medieval monasteries and cloisters, Kahn envisioned this complex as a kind of forum for social and intellectual interaction.

One can discern some of the buildings"" details: the scientists"" individual studies, the stair towers punctuating the long laboratories, the idiosyncratic screen walls with their lunettes.

The historicism that was beginning to emerge in his work is evinced by the gateway towers, which explicitly recall ancient monuments such as the Roman Colosseum in various states of decay. Kahn's idealized drawing was clearly inspired by Piranesi's famous eighteenth-century views of Rome and imaginary buildings. Here, buildings in a variety of archetypal geometric forms populate the city center. Kahn believed that only by a centralization of buildings and activities, supported by a clear ordering of streets and traffic, would meaningful urban life be preserved.","Rome (0.955657), Roman Empire (0.873877), Colosseum (0.768802), Italy (0.764766), Flavian dynasty (0.710174), Vespasian (0.634044), Roman Forum (0.607481), Amphitheatre (0.596735)"

This probing philosophical question, posed in 1955 by the American architect Louis I. Kahn, underlies the extraordinarily powerful buildings and projects for which he is known, as well as these two studies of Philadelphia's city center. In the 1950s Kahn had relatively little real work. Philadelphia, where he lived nearly all his life, was launching a decade of immense redevelopment, and Kahn was at the forefront. His numerous studies, many of them made independently without a commission, focused on the historic center city. These visionary drawings are significant not as blueprints for Philadelphia's redevelopment but because they reveal forms and ideas fulfilled in Kahn's later masterpieces. The Traffic Study is a carefully ordered conceptual plan in which Kahn proposed a new traffic pattern. In an effort to untangle traffic congestion and to mitigate the haphazard proliferation of parking lots that plagued postwar American cities, Kahn reordered the streets according to a functional hierarchy. Like an idiosyncratic musical score, the drawing's abstract notational system corresponds to different tempos of traffic, such as the stop-and-go movement of trucks and buses (dotted lines), the fast flow of vehicles around the periphery (arrows), and the stasis of cars in parking garages (spirals). To explain his movement study, Kahn invoked a historical analogy: for him, the girdle of expressways and parking towers circling the city center metaphorically recalled the walls and towers that protected the medieval cities of Europe. Kahn's specific comparison was to the largely medieval town of Carcassonne, in the South of France: just as Carcassonne was a city built for defense, Kahn envisioned the modern city center having to defend itself against the automobile.","City (0.983941), New York City (0.683132), Central business district (0.549397), Carcassonne (0.53382), Parking (0.5271), Automobile (0.519054), So Paulo (0.470005), Chicago (0.455937)"

The oversized chain link indicates the giants' power; it also refers to their being chained for their sins. Below, the tiny figures of the two poets are lowered into the pit.

Working in lithography, etching, and screenprint, he completed more than five hundred editions as well as hundreds of monotypes. In 1970 he opened his own print workshop, The Litho Shop, in Santa Monica, which allowed him to experiment as freely as his interests dictated, and also to support projects of other printmakers, enabling them to share in his experience and technical expertise. Francis brought a worldly and intellectual spirit to his art. Although he eventually settled in California, he traveled widely and lived for extended periods of time in France, Switzerland, Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia. From these locales he absorbed aesthetic and cultural ideas, as evidenced by his diverse artistic inspirations, including Henri Matisse, Dada and Surrealism, Eastern philosophy and religion, and the psychoanalytic theories of Carl Jung. In both his paintings and his prints, Francis remained a steadfast abstractionist. Working in a spontaneous, unpremeditated fashion, he created on a large scale in a vivid palette using a personal vocabulary of biomorphic forms, loose brushstrokes, and an astounding variety of drips and splatters, some controlled and some left to chance. Francis worked at most major American and international print workshops: Universal Limited Art Editions, whose founder, Tatyana Grosman, first introduced Francis to lithography in 1959; Emil Matthieu in Zurich; Tamarind Lithography Workshop; and Gemini G.E.L., where he made the greatest number of prints, more than sixty. Benefiting from his ongoing collaboration with various master printers at each of these venues, Francis exploited the possibilities inherent in the color printmaking process, in which each color must be printed from a separate stone or plate. He often created compositions by varying the order in which matrices were printed, or recombining different ones to make new images.","Printmaking (0.967745), Printing (0.569827), History of painting (0.416601), Carl Jung (0.372974), Art (0.358704), Modernism (0.351596), Lithography (0.313793), Henri Matisse (0.303242)"

Abstract though her paintings are, she saw them as dealing with nature—with the outside world, that is, rather than the inner one. In fact she shunned self-expression as such; her work, she said, was ""about landscape, not about me."" Nor did she consider herself an ""action painter,"" since she worked more from thought than from instinct.

After a trip to Paris, he began reinterpreting art masterpieces in an impulsive, gestural, and often subversive way that mingled old and new styles, abstraction and figuration, history and satire. By the late 1950s, he was incorporating found objects and images from the mass media into his paintings, foreshadowing the practices of Pop artists. Rivers's forays into poetry, as well as his close relationships with poets and playwrights, encouraged his interest in narrative themes and in artist/writer collaborations. Also inspired by such collaborations was fledging publisher Tatyana Grosman, who had opened her print workshop, Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE) in 1957. That year she invited Rivers to make lithographs with his close friend and then lover, poet Frank O'Hara. The project was a series of firsts: ULAE's first invitation to an artist; Rivers's first foray into printmaking; and the workshop's first illustrated book. In addition to his many projects at ULAE, Rivers made prints with Marlborough Graphics and Edition Schellmann, among other publishers. For the book Stones, Rivers and O'Hara jumped in with an enthusiasm and lack of experience that gave them freedom to experiment. Together they created an intimate dialogue, starting each print with individual titles and then responding to each other's imagery and words. Their decision to ink the edges of the stones gives the prints in this volume a storyboard frame. Autobiographical and full of spontaneous fragments, Stones epitomizes the close relationships between artists and poets in New York in the 1950s, as well as the vitality found at a burgeoning print workshop.","Printmaking (0.946824), Printing (0.715971), Interpersonal relationship (0.703144), New York School (0.629838), 1950s (0.620819), Painting (0.605554), History of painting (0.565829), Pop art (0.552432)"

Kandinsky was the first modern artist to paint an entirely abstract composition; at the time of Picture with an Archer, that work was just a few months away.Kandinsky took his approach from Paris—particularly from the Fauves—but used it to create an Eastern landscape suffused with a folktale mood. Galloping under the trees of a wildly radiant countryside, a horseman turns in his saddle and aims his bow. In the left foreground stand men in Russian dress; behind them are a house, a domed tower, and two bulbous mountainy pinnacles, cousins of the bent–necked spire in the picture's center. Russian icons show similar rocks, which do exist in places in the East, but even so have a fantastical air. The lone rider with his archaic weapon, the traditional costumes and buildings, and the rural setting intensify the note of fantasy or poetic romance.

He later served as the first artistic director of the printing shop of the Bauhaus, a progressive arts-and-crafts school founded at Weimar in 1919. Of the more than three hundred woodcuts Feininger produced, the one initially titled The Cathedral of Socialism is the most historically significant and widely admired. It served as a cover design for the Bauhaus manifesto by architect Walter Gropius and was meant to symbolize both the unity and the spiritual basis of the various arts under the primacy of architecture. The fragmented and intersecting planes that convey dynamism in Cathedral first appeared in Feininger's work about 1911, under the influence of Cubism. His drypoint The Gate, depicting tiny figures in a medieval setting animated by exaggerated proportions, includes stark contrasts of light and dark and skewed forms. Feininger's love of Gothic architecture is evident in this town gate, which he depicted in woodcuts and paintings. This print, a high point in Feininger's oeuvre of some sixty-five intaglios from 1906 to 1924, was published after the war in an important series of German print portfolios entitled Die Schaffenden.

After a discouraging experience studying academic painting in Paris, he returned to his hometown of Bordeaux, where he began making etchings in 1864. Later, returning to Paris, he was encouraged by a fellow artist to try lithography and was introduced to Lemercier, a renowned Parisian workshop. He soon discovered that the unique qualities of this technique enabled him to achieve infinite gradations of tone, fine-line drawing, and rich depictions of light and dark. Also, through the possibility of editioning, he found a vehicle for broadly distributing the intimate imagery of his drawings. During his lifetime, Redon made close to thirty etchings and two hundred lithographs, working almost exclusively in black and white. His reputation flourished, due, in part, to the availability of his prints. He became a celebrated figure in fin-de-siècle Paris, greatly admired by artists and writers of the Symbolist movement with whom he shared an enthusiasm for the fantastic, mystical, and sublime forces found beneath the surface of everyday life. Using nature as his starting point, Redon imagined new worlds through his enigmatic creations, such as The Eye Like a Strange Balloon Mounts Toward Infinity. The majority of Redon's lithographs are found in albums based on thematic or literary subjects. He was greatly inspired by such authors as Edgar Allan Poe and Gustave Flaubert, whose unusual sensibilities were well suited to the artist's own. Redon was so moved by Flaubert's 1874 prose poem The Temptation of Saint Anthony that he created three separate projects based on it.","Edgar Allan Poe (0.977225), Symbolism (0.937438), Odilon Redon (0.828179), Lithography (0.633684), Drawing (0.617952), Poetry (0.601131), Eureka: A Prose Poem (0.532906), Les Nabis (0.526122)"

His designs for this famous entrance arch and two others were intended to visually enhance the experience of underground travel on the new subway system for Paris.Paris was not the first city to implement an underground system (London already had one), but the approaching Paris Exposition of 1900 accelerated the need for an efficient and attractive means of mass transportation. Although Guimard never formally entered the competition for the design of the system's entrance gates that had been launched by the Compagnie du Métropolitain in 1898, he won the commission with his avant-garde schemes, all using standardized cast-iron components to facilitate manufacture, transport, and assembly. While Parisians were at first hesitant in their response to Guimard's use of an unfamiliar vocabulary, his Métro gates, installed throughout the city, effectively brought the Art Nouveau style, formerly associated with the luxury market, into the realm of popular culture.","Art Nouveau (0.954089), Design (0.734541), London Underground (0.676177), Classical mechanics (0.664244), Rapid transit (0.639928), New York City (0.629195), Graphic design (0.573892), Mass (0.563654)"

Its intricacy lies in both the method of its construction—it is made of shallow open boxes fitted together in a jigsawlike stack—and those boxes' contents, the salvaged wood bits and pieces with which Nevelson filled many of her works. These include moldings, dowels, spindles, chair parts, architectural ornaments, and scroll-sawed fragments. Nevelson makes this material into a high wall variegated by a play of flatness and recession, straight lines and curves, overlaps and vacancies, that has been likened to the faceting of Cubism and has an absorbing visual complexity.A Surrealist artist might have shared Nevelson's relish for curious bric-à-brac, but might also have arranged such a collection in jarring and disorienting juxtapositions. Nevelson, by contrast, paints every object and box the same dully glowing black, unifying them visually while also obscuring their original identities.

Cassatt's expression of contented self-assurance contrasts sharply with the apprehensive posture of the shopgirl, a figure obscured by cropping and the lack of delineation of her facial features.In this daring nuanced composition about modern life—the subject is the fleeting encounter rather than the women themselves—Degas heeded the advice of the critic Edmond Duranty, who, in his 1876 pamphlet, The New Painting—about the art that came to be known as Impressionism—wrote: ""Let us take leave of the stylized human body, which is treated like a vase.

His mother, widowed when the artist was still a young boy, worked as a textile designer and dressmaker to support her family, and Vuillard, who lived with her until her death in 1928, was deeply influenced by his experiences of family life. Often described as an ""intimist,"" he frequently used his mother and sister as models, depicting them in household surroundings of patterned wallpaper and fabrics. Like many other Nabi artists, Vuillard was inspired by Japanese ukiyo-e prints to elevate quotidian scenes as suitable motifs for art. His Parisian interpretation of this concept is visible throughout the 1899 portfolio Landscapes and Interiors, of which The Cook is one example. This group of lithographs, widely considered to be Vuillard's most important print project, was published by Ambroise Vollard, a central figure in the print revival of the 1890s. In all, the artist made approximately seventy printed compositions over the course of his career.   Vuillard engaged in many aspects of the cultural life of Paris and, as a Nabi, sought to intertwine his artistic projects with the realms of theater, literature, and music. In addition to designing sets for plays by Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg, he created posters and theater programs, formats which demonstrate the ways in which printed art extended beyond the traditional realm of the art collector at this time.

Together with other core members—Erich Heckel, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Max Pechstein, and, briefly, Emil Nolde—Kirchner sought a new spirit of freedom and authenticity that rejected both the stultifying traditions of the academy and the restrictive conventions of bourgeois society. Brücke artists felt that art could respond to essential life forces with spontaneity and immediacy through such subjects as the nude in nature or figures dancing with frenzy and abandon. Sharing studios and models, teaching each other techniques, and even vacationing together, they evolved a common style that first embraced the fluidity of Fauvism and then turned to the energy and angularity of tribal art for inspiration. Printmaking was fundamental to Brücke activities, and annual portfolios of prints were published to help the artists gain recognition and produce income. For the most part, however, members' prints were experimental in nature and made with only a few proof impressions. Kirchner continued this unstructured approach to printmaking even after the dissolution of Brücke in 1913, eventually creating some two thousand works, primarily in his own studio. During World War I, after briefly training in the mounted artillery, Kirchner suffered a mental collapse. His depiction as an isolated figure is seen here in Evening Patrol of 1915. His series of prints of this period, entitled Schlemihl Meets His Shadow, is also considered the embodiment of his anxiety and paranoia, conditions that would continue to plague him, along with ill health, for the remainder of his life. In 1938, after being ostracized from German art circles by the Nazis, and having hundreds of his paintings removed from museums and declared ""degenerate,"" Kirchner ended his own life.","Expressionism (0.944866), Die Brcke (0.903099), Degenerate art (0.734899), Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (0.630296), Karl Schmidt-Rottluff (0.529141), German painters (0.497177), German printmakers (0.467178), Modern painters (0.447971)"

He was a dedicated printmaker, completing more than nine hundred prints between 1905 and 1950. Although he moved to Berlin in 1908, three years ahead of the rest of the Brücke group, he remained close, both personally and stylistically, to fellow members Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Erich Heckel. Dancers is an exuberant example of the Brücke artists' aspirations for art to be a force for social and cultural renewal. Their anti-bourgeois taste for subjects taken from the fringes of society led them to base many images on the cabaret, with dance especially valued as an immediate and uninhibited form of expression. Stylistically the print is similarly radical, with Pechstein's scribbled outlines and fuzzy, speckled inking causing the overall composition to verge on the abstract. His unusual choice of an acidic yellow paper helps to suggest the lurid atmosphere of a nightclub. In 1912 Pechstein was expelled from Brücke for exhibiting his work at the Berlin Secession without the other members' consent. Two years later, he traveled to the South Seas, inspired by Oceanic sculpture in the ethnographic museum in Berlin. He later served in the infantry in World War I. Dancer Reflected in a Mirror was created during the postwar years, a time of confusion and instability in German society. In contrast to the exultant airborne dancer in Pechstein's earlier image, the performer here seems bored and oppressed by her role. The male observers appear similarly disengaged, staring in various directions with unfocused eyes. The mood of indifference in this print contrasts with its bold compositional structure and strong colors, qualities that typified the Expressionist idiom.","Expressionism (0.985282), Die Brcke (0.787166), Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (0.674896), Degenerate art (0.530221), German painters (0.492544), German printmakers (0.462014), Dresden (0.424176), Modern art (0.404266)"

In nine unremittingly caustic, clearly rendered illustrations, Grosz focuses on the corrupt nature of the pompous, overfed, and self-satisfied officers and officials who had dragged Germany into the cataclysm of World War I and who still governed the Weimar Republic. Grosz depicts the violent suppression of the working class by the ruling class. In Die Kommunisten fallen—und die Devisen steigen (Blood is the Best Sauce), uniformed soldiers beat unarmed protestors as an officer and a profiteer enjoy a decadent meal. Elsewhere, a dead body washing ashore does not disturb a soldier's cigarette break. Grosz sharpens his visual attacks with captions printed in three languages—English, French, and German. These statements are not always direct translations, but sometimes different phrases that together heighten Grosz's satirical attacks. ""Gott mit Us"" (God with us), taken from the inscription on German soldiers' belt buckles, originally meant to invoke God's support, becomes in the English caption ""God for Us,"" a nationalist cry to smite the enemy. Grosz's political stance (as a communist) and intentions (working-class revolution) were obvious.

Jawlensky did not consider his images of faces to be portraits; they were, rather, meditations on mystical and spiritual concerns. As he once remarked, ""For me the face is not just a face but the whole universe. In the face, the whole universe is revealed.""Jawlensky constructed these heads through an economical process, using only the barest number of black lines and dots—no more than eighteen marks in each composition—that he carefully plotted and painstakingly rendered. He varied the tilt and torsion of the faces from one composition to the other. Privately, he worried that these black-and-white prints lacked meaning, which he usually created through color. He embellished some of the compositions by tracing the black lines with watercolors, as he did in the Museum's five impressions.Jawlensky rarely made prints (fewer than thirty are known, as opposed to more than 2,000 oil paintings). In the early 1920s, however, the print market offered artists lucrative rewards, and the financially strapped Jawlensky took advantage of the opportunity to make this portfolio for the contemporary art society in Wiesbaden, where he had recently settled.","Face (0.978131), Painting (0.960543), Faces (0.914771), Rod Stewart (0.719367), Small Faces (0.654357)"

The prints are typical of Corinth's late expressive style, in which he sacrificed figurative legibility for emotional drama. His rapid, sketchy approach in Der Tell-Schuss (Tell's shot), for example, underscores the urgency of the famous moment when Tell must shoot an apple off his son's head for failing to pay homage to a symbol of the emperor. The image, a blur of warm, exuberant color, conveys the swirling rush of fear, anger, and determination that focused Tell's resolve to save his child and take revenge on the unjust ruler. Corinth knew Schiller's play well. His father had given him a copy for his twelfth birthday. The artist had passed that copy down to his own son, Thomas, in 1914, and he consulted it when making these prints after visiting Switzerland in 1923.","William Tell (0.946629), Friedrich Schiller (0.893632), Germany (0.801577), Altdorf, Switzerland (0.743887), Political philosophy (0.72406), Homage (0.671801), Folk hero (0.667542), William Tell (0.619273)"

The paintings, originally executed between 1896 and 1915, had long since passed from his possession; one had been destroyed during World War I. Many had special significance to Corinth: Totenklage (Death lament) hung in his studio as his daughter was baptized, and Der Sieger (The victor) portrays him and his wife. For these graphic versions, Corinth completely reinterpreted the earlier compositions. In Grablegung (Burial), he reduced the number of figures in order to focus on the dead Jesus. He transformed Die Geburt der Venus (The birth of Venus) from a precisely detailed painting of academic nudes to a sketchy, barely legible swirl of frenetic lines surrounding voluptuous female bodies. These prints showcase Corinth's shift later in life toward a more expressive approach, in which he employed passionate draftsmanship and dramatic contrasts of light and shadow to convey emotion.PUBLISHING HISTORYIn the inflationary print boom of the early 1920s, Corinth eagerly embraced printmaking for its financial promise.

She ends up in Golconda, a magnificent place far beyond the borders of European civilization, where she becomes queen. Her young seducer visits the city, and they rekindle their youthful liaison. Golconda is an old name for Hyderabad, India. Corinth's Golconda, however, is largely an imaginary place, located in an exotic Orient filled with lavishly costumed characters. His warm, rich palette and harried draftsmanship are perfectly suited to this tale of erotic delight.

In Aline und der Pfarrer (Aline and the minister), a blur of color surrounds Aline's voluptuous nude body as she reunites with her lover.The story was originally written by French author Stanislas-Jean de Boufflers as Aline, reine de Golconde, and became an instant hit upon its publication in 1761.

Things end badly. Corinth's quick, loose draftsmanship conveys the moral ambiguity and confusion of identities in Schiller's play, and his dramatic use of light and dark reflects the horrors and the growing psychological despair that beset the characters. PUBLISHING HISTORYFounded in 1919, Avalun Verlag focused on publishing luxury editions of classic literary works with illustrations by contemporary artists. In December 1922, the publisher approached Corinth about doing a project, leaving the choices of text, medium, and number of illustrations up to the artist. This resultant portfolio of twelve unbound lithographs based on Die Räuber was issued with the first fifty copies of the book edition.

A non-narrative work, it has been identified as a key example of the ""trance film,"" in which a protagonist appears in a dreamlike state, and where the camera conveys his or her subjective focus. The central figure in Meshes of the Afternoon, played by Deren, is attuned to her unconscious mind and caught in a web of dream events that spill over into reality. Symbolic objects, such as a key and a knife, recur throughout the film; events are open-ended and interrupted. Deren explained that she wanted ""to put on film the feeling which a human being experiences about an incident, rather than to record the incident accurately.""Made by Deren with her husband, cinematographer Alexander Hammid, Meshes of the Afternoon established the independent avant-garde movement in film in the United States, which is known as the New American Cinema. It directly inspired early works by Kenneth Anger, Stan Brakhage, and other major experimental filmmakers. Beautifully shot by Hammid, a leading documentary filmmaker and cameraman in Europe (where he used the surname Hackenschmied) before he moved to New York, the film makes new and startling use of such standard cinematic devices as montage editing and matte shots. Through her extensive writings, lectures, and films, Deren became the preeminent voice of avant-garde cinema in the 1940s and the early 1950s.","Experimental film (0.978464), Maya Deren (0.674535), Film director (0.628395), Stan Brakhage (0.520245), Jonas Mekas (0.460849), Avant-garde (0.433156), Film (0.432979), Kenneth Anger (0.420134)"

In 1908 he explained that his goal in portraiture was not to achieve visual precision but rather to reveal the ""essential qualities"" of his sitters—qualities, he felt, that physical imitation could not capture.",""

He created more than two thousand printed images, working primarily in intaglio techniques but also, for extended periods, in lithography and linoleum cut. It was usually the influence of a master craftsman in a collaborative workshop that served as the impetus for Picasso's printmaking, as new techniques fueled his imagination. Picasso's early prints reflect his evolving artistic language and his place within the major modern movements. The Frugal Repast, of 1904...evokes a sense of mystery and nobility surrounding poverty, recalling the Symbolist aesthetic of Picasso's Blue and Rose periods. Two years later, a woodcut of his companion, Fernande Olivier, betrays the simplified forms he found in Iberian sculpture and a raw expressionism inspired by tribal art. Picasso's illustrations for Saint Matorel, with text by his friend Max Jacob, incorporate the Cubist idiom with which he is most closely associated. While this abstracted language of forms served him throughout his career, his work remained aligned with figurative imagery. In his great prints of the 1930s, created in collaboration with master printer Roger Lacourière, his allegorical inclinations are revealed, while these works also share Surrealist preoccupations with the unconscious. Well into his later years, Picasso remained open to the potential of a new technique. He discovered lithography in the 1940s, at the workshop of Fernand Mourlot in Paris. One monumental series created there, Woman in an Armchair, exists in thirty experimental variations. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he was stimulated by the possibilities of linoleum cut under the tutelage of Hidalgo Arnéra, a printer whose shop was near his studio in southern France. Innovations continued, as evidenced by the one-block process he devised for color printing, seen in the striking Still Life with Glass under the Lamp.","Pablo Picasso (0.957954), Printmaking (0.947093), Printing (0.74869), Lithography (0.679701), Cubism (0.660061), Georges Braque (0.605715), Symbolism (0.557714), Sculpture (0.51778)"

Although he was aware of the avant-garde movements of his time and even flirted briefly with Futurism and metaphysical art in the teens and twenties, he refused to ally himself with any artistic group. He lived his entire life in Bologna and focused almost exclusively on landscapes and, most famously, still lifes. He endlessly arranged and rearranged the same objects—bottles, tins, and boxes collected from the shops near his home—in search of new combinations and formal possibilities. His paintings are characterized by their sensitive lighting and subtle palette, reminiscent of the soft ochers, pinks, and browns found in Bologna's architecture and landscape. Morandi is celebrated for his virtuoso etchings, which number nearly one hundred forty. The technique appealed to him for its intimacy and methodical craftsmanship. Using a small press at home or at the Academy of Fine Arts in Bologna, where he was a professor, he would usually print only a few copies of a given image. Most were not editioned until the late 1930s and 1940s at the Calcografia Nazionale, the repository for Italian prints and printing plates in Rome. In Large Still Life with Coffeepot, Morandi used the etching needle in his typical fashion to define forms through meticulous layers of hatched and cross-hatched lines. His carefully modulated tonalities coalesce into an architectonic composition that invites careful inspection and meditation. The ethereal lighting creates an atmosphere of restrained emotion and pregnant, almost eerie, stillness. Morandi's landscapes, which reflect his admiration for Paul Cézanne, depict the area around Grizzana, a nearby village where he spent his holidays.

Comprising approximately one hundred eighty-five etchings dated 1905 to 1945, Marin's printed oeuvre also includes early atmospheric scenes of European cities and late views of boats on choppy seas. Trained both as an architect and as an artist, Marin was a superlative draftsman who began to make etchings in Paris in 1905, utilizing a newly acquired press. In trips away from the city, which served as his home base, he gathered imagery from Venice, Amsterdam, and other European centers. In some one hundred scenic etchings made at this time, he experimented with variations in plate tone and other inking techniques to achieve rich lines and surfaces. His practice of sketching directly on the copperplates, as well as his ethereal effects, followed techniques made popular by James McNeill Whistler in the 1880s. Upon his return to New York in 1911, Marin created his first two etchings of the Brooklyn Bridge, a marvel of Gothic architecture and modern engineering completed in 1883. He returned to this subject again in 1913 when, perhaps influenced by the Armory Show held in New York that year, and by his association with the circle of modernist artists at Alfred Stieglitz's ""291"" gallery, he introduced an abstracted, Cubist vocabulary, marking the beginning of his mature style. The two prints shown here demonstrate how Marin exploited the linear potential of etching to animate a towering urban structure. He continued to explore the dynamism of the Brooklyn Bridge as a subject in his prints until 1944, creating eighteen images in all.","New York City (0.977496), Alfred Stieglitz (0.807012), Brooklyn (0.742511), Modern art (0.667232), Brooklyn Bridge (0.649809), Manhattan (0.631954), James Abbott McNeill Whistler (0.631405), Armory Show (0.625367)"

These ten oversize lithographs present an unflinching look at social disintegration and civil violence after the catastrophe of World War I. Beckmann visited Berlin in March 1919, and depicts himself amid the misery in Hölle; his self-portrait appears in five prints and on the front cover, which, in a handwritten note, promises the viewer an entertaining spectacle. Unlike many of his compatriots, including the disfigured veteran he encounters in the first print, Der Nachhauseweg (The way home), Beckmann came back whole. He presents a fragmented city, with bodies jutting out of the pictures' frames and figures contorted in impossible spaces. In Die Strasse (The street), a thoroughfare is bustling with daytime activity, yet no one notices the man being carried off, arms flailing, by another man. In Das Martyrium (The martyrdom), under the cover of night, communist leader Rosa Luxemburg is about to be murdered. Speeches, songs, and even last stands are futile. No place is safe: Beckmann transforms an attic into a torture chamber in Die Nacht (Night), while quiet desperation pervades his own family's home in Der Hunger (Hunger). In the final print, Die Familie (The family), Beckmann's young son, Peter, mistakes a grenade for a toy. Beckmann brings the hell of war home in these prints. His publisher, J. B.

As a German expatriate, he was imprisoned in the South of France for fourteen months after the outbreak of World War II in 1939. While in detention he made drawings and watercolors depicting fantastic landscapes and amorphous faces and figures that reflect the influence of children's art and the work of Paul Klee. After his release, Wols hid in Cassis, in unoccupied France. The artist never completely recovered from his war-related traumas, and the next decade, the last of his short life, was complicated by poverty, illness, and alcoholism. In 1945 Wols returned to Paris and began making small, abstract paintings using the automatic lines and drips of Surrealism in compositions typically based around a heavy central mass. The free-associative, hallucinatory quality of his work provides a link between that prewar movement and the gestural abstraction known generally as Art informel that took hold in the years after. Wols was immediately viewed as a pioneer of this latter style, and the agitated nature of his markings seemed to give visual form to the existential anxiety of the postwar era. Wols's prints, a total of fifty-three drypoints created between 1945 and his death in 1951, comprise a distinct yet integral segment of his oeuvre. Nearly half were made as illustrations for books by Surrealist and Existential writers who befriended him, including Jean-Paul Sartre, Tristan Tzara, and René de Solier. The process of scratching directly on the plate with a drypoint needle was well-suited to Wols's compulsive style. The thin, scratchy lines with their characteristic burr capture all the microscopic details of his barbed, nestlike microcosms and the fuzzy tendrils of his insectlike forms.","Existentialism (0.976014), Modernism (0.882845), Surrealism (0.839563), Jean-Paul Sartre (0.776583), Martin Heidegger (0.669259), Sren Kierkegaard (0.666991), Abstract expressionism (0.657026), Tachisme (0.649498)"

In doing so, he learned how all art was based on measurement and adjustment and the manipulation of a variable but finite number of pictorial elements.

The most dedicated printmaker of the three ""giants,"" Orozco completed some thirty lithographs and twenty intaglios during his career, printing etchings in his own studio. Orozco spent his formative years as an illustrator drawing political cartoons for newspapers in Mexico City. Later, in New York, he was encouraged by Carl Zigrosser of the Weyhe Gallery to make lithographs in order to reach a wider audience. Orozco was influenced primarily by native sources: the prints of José Guadalupe Posada; the expressive symbolism of his teachers in Mexico City; his work for the local press; and the horrors of the Mexican Revolution of 1910. In the early 1920s he joined the fledgling muralist movement, having completed his first mural cycle at the National Preparatory School in 1916. The Franciscan and the Indian is based on a detail from this mural. While Orozco, unlike his peers, refused to participate in the Communist party, he critiqued Spanish colonialism with this image, depicting an all-powerful missionary looming over a frail Indian, reversing the effect of what appears to be an affectionate embrace. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Orozco lived in the United States, where he painted murals in California, New York, and New Hampshire, and exhibited at the Weyhe Gallery and at Delphic Studios in New York, both of which published his prints. Returning to Mexico City to complete a mural commission, Orozco developed an increasingly loose and expressive style from the mid-to-late 1930s, incorporating caricature and satire from his early political illustrations. Originally conceived as a print, The Masses later served as the basis for a black-and-white mural in the Gabiño Ortíz Library in Jiquilpan, Mexico.","Diego Rivera (0.96867), Mexico (0.901188), Jos Clemente Orozco (0.845229), Mexico City (0.716625), David Alfaro Siqueiros (0.664704), Mural (0.534033), Leon Trotsky (0.469407), United States (0.441478)"

But the star and planet, refracted by light, go undescribed in any literal way. ""The breaking up of form by light creates colored planes,"" Delaunay said. ""These colored planes are the structure of the picture, and nature is no longer a subject for description but a pretext."" Indeed, he had decided to abandon ""images or reality that come to corrupt the order of color.""The poet Guillaume Apollinaire christened Delaunay's style ""Orphism,"" after Orpheus, the musician of Greek legend whose eloquence on the lyre is a mythic archetype for the power of art. The musicality of Delaunay's work lay in color, which he studied closely. In fact, he derived the phrase ""Simultaneous Contrasts"" from the treatise On the Law of the Simultaneous Contrast of Colors, published in 1839 by Michel-Eugène Chevreul. Absorbing Chevreul's scientific analyses, Delaunay has here gone beyond them into a mystical belief in color, its fusion into unity symbolizing the possibility for harmony in the chaos of the modern world.","Cubism (0.968426), Color (0.878875), Vision (0.844928), Light (0.800124), Nature (0.799332), Guillaume Apollinaire (0.764072), Orphism (0.710266), Universe (0.65976)"

Aboard the steamship that had taken him to New York, Picabia had been captivated by the movement of Stacia Napierkowska, a Polish dancer en route to a tour of American music halls. (Her performances were suggestive enough to provoke her arrest once on U.S. shores.) Over the next two years, Picabia produced several monumental canvases that he said were inspired by his memories of Napierkowska, and also, he said, ""of America, evocations from there which, subtly opposed like musical harmonies, become representative of an idea, of a nostalgia, of a fugitive impression.""

Although the chair was originally designed in 1918, its color scheme of primary colors (red, yellow, blue) plus black—so closely associated with the de Stijl group and its most famous theorist and practitioner Piet Mondrian—was applied to it around 1923. Hoping that much of his furniture would eventually be mass-produced rather than handcrafted, Rietveld aimed for simplicity in construction. The pieces of wood that comprise the Red Blue Chair are in the standard lumber sizes readily available at the time.Rietveld believed there was a greater goal for the furniture designer than just physical comfort: the well-being and comfort of the spirit. Rietveld and his colleagues in the de Stijl art and architecture movement sought to create a utopia based on a harmonic human-made order, which  they believed could renew Europe after the devastating turmoil of World War I.

A painter and draftsman as well as a sculptor, González realized that by cutting, rolling, and bending metal, or fusing found metal pieces into an assemblage, he could draw images not on paper but in air, his instrument not a pencil but a welding torch. He often worked in iron, a tough, unyielding material utterly lacking in the fine sinuosity of the precious metals. The stiff spine, shallow curves, and spiky, spearlike lines and points of Woman Combing Her Hair seem integral to the medium itself, but the work tempers its austerity with a subtle eroticism.González himself associated iron with weaponry and with engineering, but wanted to direct it elsewhere. ""It is high time,"" he wrote, ""that this metal cease to be a murderer and the simple instrument of an overly mechanical science. Today, the door is opened wide to this material to be . . . forged and hammered by the peaceful hands of artists."" Decorative ironwork is a Spanish tradition, and González learned it as a young man, but considered it only a craft until, in 1928, he began to advise Pablo Picasso on making iron sculpture—an experience that inspired him to become a sculptor himself.","Pablo Picasso (0.959119), Metal (0.735255), Collage (0.712566), Sculpture (0.644011), Drawing (0.637876), Cubism (0.631335), Oxygen (0.563572), Engineering (0.483117)"

The sharply rendered comedic scenes and absurdist hallucinations express his simultaneous disdain and desire for the comforts of middle-class life. Bored and restless, Eberhard Kautsch (Ebbi) yearns to become a poet and lead a life unencumbered by his dull family, the daily drudgery of office work, and hemorrhoids. Johanna Löffel, a seductive young painter, spirits him away to a cheap brothel, where his impotence mirrors his inability to overcome conventional morality. There they meet a thug recently released from jail, Jakob Nipsel, whom Beckmann modeled on himself in the illustrations. A wild night of cocaine-induced hallucinations follows. The trio then breaks into the apartment of Ebbi's nouveau-riche friends. Realizing he cannot stomach robbery and murder, Ebbi saves the doorman from Nipsel's violence and returns, a hero, to bourgeois life.In addition to Ebbi, Beckmann wrote two other plays, neither of which was a theatrical success. Ebbi itself was not performed until 1980. After Beckmann's frequent publisher Reinhard Piper declined to publish the play, Otto Nirenstein agreed to issue a small edition of thirty-three copies through his Johannes-Presse in 1924, and commissioned the illustrations from the artist.","Publishing (0.908639), Social class (0.855103), The Play (0.780325), Play (0.778778), The Trio (0.77839), Conflicting Emotions (0.760711), Theatre (0.747793), Bourgeoisie (0.745927)"

Ensor's obsession with death and impermanence led him to printmaking. As he stated, ""I dread the fragility of painting.

The printed word—its appearance, meaning, and sound—was a constant source of inspiration for Schwitters. He used printed and stamped letters in his collages and poems, and by the mid-1920s had become a successful graphic designer. Schwitters's involvement with traditional printmaking techniques, however, was limited, as he focused more on ephemeral printed projects. In 1918, after serving in World War I, Schwitters began publishing his poetry in the Expressionist journal Der Sturm and associating with the artists surrounding this journal and gallery of the same name. The title of Schwitters's book, Die Kathedrale, reflects the Expressionists' embrace of the Gothic cathedral as an emblem of unification in the arts. The white square of paper on the cover, part of a wraparound seal added by Schwitters, declares, ""Beware: Anti-Dada."" At this point, the Dadaists were antagonistic toward Schwitters, whom they considered bourgeois and not sufficiently political.""Merz,"" a play on the German word for commerce, was an overarching term Schwitters used to describe collages, poems, and performances he created by combining such elements as bits of odd paper found in the streets, snippets of overheard conversation, or fragments of text from everyday sources. Between 1923 and 1932 he also published a journal entitled Merz, which comprised twenty-four issues. The third issue is a portfolio of lithographs that served as a special edition of the journal. In typical Dada fashion, he included random elements such as found typographic fragments and photographic images in these prints.

The twelve lithographs are a manifestation of Kokoschka's obsession and infatuation with Alma Mahler, his lover from 1912 to 1914. Apart from the portfolio's title—a reference to the movie The Coming of Columbus, which Kokoschka had watched with Mahler one summer—the prints have no connection to the historical explorer. The series serves as a meditation on the universal and timeless conflict between the sexes. Kokoschka, unable to free himself from his desire, depicts himself as following Mahler on a path that ultimately leads to his own demise. Along the way, he weaves personal memories from their relationship into the images. Das Paar im Kerzenlicht (Couple in candlelight) recalls an experience they had in a hotel: fog floated into their room through an open balcony door; to Mahler's delight, Kokoschka placed a candle underneath it to dispel the ghostlike apparition. The rich range of tonal contrasts, achieved through Kokoschka's skillful use of the lithographic crayon, underscores the dreamlike quality of the events.

The final state, made from a cast of Back (III), is a starkly refined, highly architectural monolith in which the struggles of the earlier states have been smoothed away. Matisse kept a plaster version of Back (IV) in his studio for the rest of his life, and it is visible in photographs with his late, monumental paper cutouts (below), which—like his works of 1913–17—combine pictorial and sculptural characteristics. All four Backs were unique plaster bas-reliefs until 1950, when Back (I), (III), and (IV) were cast in bronze; Back (II) was not discovered until 1955, a year after the artist's death, and it was cast a year later.","Remainder (0.932431), 2006 (0.784422), 2007 (0.776734), 2008 (0.770755), 2004 (0.703993), Sculpture (0.690725), The Final (0.642452), State (0.639253)"

So Matisse believed the sculptor should proceed, and the credo can be sensed in this work and throughout the group of four relief sculptures to which it belongs, with its progressive stability and simplicity. Matisse did not conceive The Backs as a series, but occasionally returned to the theme over the years. Even so, these reliefs—his largest sculptures—present a coherent progress, from a relatively detailed naturalism toward a near-abstract monumentality. This work is the third in the series, and it is more vertical and less sinuous than its precursors. The first work in the series (1909) has a dynamic tension, and an arabesque line flows through it; in the second (1913), the body is more erect, less fluid. The left leg has become a thick pillar; making the figure more solid. The third work leads to the fourth (1931), where Matisse suppresses physical detail, making the contours more fluid, the surface more homogeneous. But if he surrenders expressiveness in the sculpture's parts, he regains it in the symmetrical harmony of the work as a whole.","Sculpture (0.987222), Relief (0.717303), Human anatomy (0.581393), Pablo Picasso (0.571146), The Work (0.47348)"

Bellows was initially inspired by the etchings of John Sloan, his supervisor at the Socialist magazine The New Masses, but after making one etching, he switched to lithography, finding it more suited to his fluid, gestural draftsmanship. Bellows produced nearly two hundred lithographs between 1916 and his untimely death in 1925. His subjects range from genre scenes, social issues, and the atrocities of war to portraiture and the nude. His prints were occasionally based on earlier works in other mediums, particularly his illustrations, but prints also led to new paintings and drawings. In the 1920s Bellows worked with master printers George C. Miller and Bolton Brown, both of whom were known for their contributions to the practice of lithography among American artists at the time. In addition, Bellows owned his own press, enabling him to rework compositions through multiple states and to experiment with tonal effects. Bellows's boxing series comprises eighteen lithographs, twenty-two drawings, and six paintings, dating from 1907 to 1924. Dempsey and Firpo was the result of an assignment Bellows received from the Saturday Evening Post to cover a prizefight between the champion Jack Dempsey and the Argentinean contender Luis Firpo. The artist chose to depict the moment when Dempsey was knocked out of the ring. Many believe the crowd pushed Dempsey back in, making his subsequent victory controversial. The lithograph captures the fall and the stunned expressions of the audience. Light-and-dark effects describe the muscular, athletic bodies and also convey the drama of the struggle.","Printmaking (0.969365), Ashcan School (0.951113), American realism (0.901143), John French Sloan (0.809902), Robert Henri (0.80242), Boxing (0.699203), The Masses (0.635363), Jack Dempsey (0.615241)"

In Apotheose (Apotheosis), fragmented body parts and leering faces orbit a grotesquely distorted prostitute, whose outsize genitalia mark the center of the composition. Dix believed in the utter incompatibility of men and women. He borrowed imagery conveying the epic conflict of the sexes from philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, such as the juxtaposed moon and sun in Mann und Weib (Nächtliche Szene) (Man and woman [nocturnal scene]) and the cats slinking over moonlit roofs in Katzen (Cats). On the streets, meanwhile, traditional order—both moral and pictorial—breaks down. Die Prominenten (Konstellation) (The celebrities [constellation]) reveals Dix's skepticism toward exuberant promises of a better future: four ideologues share a single body, espousing a manifesto of love, fatherland, order, and Dada. Although still indebted stylistically to the Expressionist techniques of distortion, the Futurist fracturing of picture planes, and the Cubist use of collage, Dix has already discovered the power of scathing social critique in these early woodcuts, which count as some of his first prints.

He was a member of an artistic family that included siblings Marcel Duchamp, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, and Suzanne Duchamp. Villon started his own career designing illustrations for Parisian journals, as well as posters and prints in the style largely made popular by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec in the 1890s. With the help of printer Eugène Delâtre and publisher Edmond Sagot, he produced nearly two hundred fifty intaglio prints by 1910, often working through multiple states, combining techniques and printing multicolor or single-color variants. Renée, Three Quarters View is one of forty intaglio prints from 1910 to 1913 that mark a point of transition in Villon's overall oeuvre toward greater abstraction. At this time he traveled in a circle of artists working in a Cubist style, which led to a change in his approach to figure-ground relationships, relying on straight, parallel, and cross-hatched lines to present his subjects as faceted volumes in flattened space. As was often his practice, Villon returned here to an earlier subject, a family member whom he had rendered as a seductively posed child years before. This version of Renée as a dour adult is closely based on Villon's painting of the same title and date. It also relates to an earlier drypoint in which Renée faces forward, as well as to two smaller, subsequently etched versions of this sitter. For the remainder of his five-decade career, Villon continued to create intaglio prints. Sought after for his skills as a printmaker, he also made color aquatints and lithographs after paintings by established artists as a means of earning income. In all, he completed seven hundred prints, including one hundred such reproductive prints and nearly seventy-five illustrations for book projects.","Printmaking (0.970931), Marcel Duchamp (0.941081), Cubism (0.863571), Raymond Duchamp-Villon (0.770211), Suzanne Duchamp (0.682607), Jacques Villon (0.680158), Armory Show (0.588365), History of painting (0.576838)"

Together with other core members—Erich Heckel, Karl Schmidt—Rottluff, Max Pechstein, and, briefly, Emil Nolde-Kirchner sought a new spirit of freedom and authenticity that rejected both the stultifying traditions of the academy and the restrictive conventions of bourgeois society. Brücke artists felt that art could respond to essential life forces with spontaneity and immediacy through such subjects as the nude in nature or figures dancing with frenzy and abandon. Sharing studios and models, teaching each other techniques, and even vacationing together, they evolved a common style that first embraced the fluidity of Fauvism and then turned to the energy and angularity of tribal art for inspiration.Printmaking was fundamental to Brücke activities, and annual portfolios of prints were published to help the artists gain recognition and produce income. For the most part, however, members' prints were experimental in nature and made with only a few proof impressions. Kirchner continued this unstructured approach to printmaking even after the dissolution of Brücke in 1913, eventually creating some two thousand works, primarily in his own studio. During World War I, after briefly training in the mounted artillery, Kirchner suffered a mental collapse. His depiction as an isolated figure is seen here in Evening Patrol of 1915.

Kirchner has violently heightened the colors of this urban scene, depicting its figures with masklike faces and vacant eyes in an attempt to capture the psychological alienation wrought by modernization.

Despite the various subjects, the prints all share a somber mood that reflects the economic and political uncertainty of the times. Heckel puts this sense of foreboding in visual terms through Expressionist manipulations of space and stark contrasts of black and white. Abrupt cropping and the narrow, vertical format heighten the feelings of oppression and tension. Even when placed in a sweeping landscape, figures are compressed into a tight space. The dark background seems to collapse around the figure in Man in der Ebene (Man on a plain); bound in on all sides, he has no place else to go. Zwei Verwundete (Two wounded soldiers) shows two men waiting in a cramped room, unable to escape the misery of war.

Klinger meticulously depicts the real and the imaginary with hallucinatory clarity, casting himself as protagonist. At a skating rink in Berlin, Klinger is seen eyeing a beautiful young woman; he swoops down to retrieve her dropped glove. This intimate and potently sexualized object triggers a series of elaborate visions of longing and loss, conveyed through dreamlike distortions of scale and jarring juxtapositions. As desire threatens to engulf Klinger, the fetishized glove takes on a life of its own. It assumes the attributes of Venus, born of sea foam and driving a shell chariot. An outsize version torments him in his sleep, recalling Francisco de Goya's prints. Klinger's grasp on the glove remains elusive, and a fantastic creature finally spirits the object away. PUBLISHING HISTORYIn 1878 Klinger, just twenty-one years old, debuted at the Berlin Royal Academy of the Arts' annual exhibition with a cycle of drawings that, encouraged by art dealer and engraver Hermann Sagert, he etched two years later and published in 1881 as Ein Handschuh. This is one of thirteen print portfolios he created during his long and distinguished career. For Klinger, prints were an ideal medium for examining contemporary social issues and scenes from his own imagination—for exploring what he called the ""dark side of life."" More specifically, he found black-and-white prints, with their lack of color and thus their distance from everyday life, to be well suited to his subjective view of the world. Klinger's prints were an enormous influence on later artists and printmakers, including Käthe Kollwitz, German Expressionists, and Surrealists.","Printmaking (0.954479), Francisco Goya (0.643532), Jacques Lacan (0.432882), Pablo Picasso (0.421311), Expressionism (0.414452), The Cure (0.412394), Life (0.393174), Black Paintings (0.388345)"

Cage met Graves in 1937 and began organizing shows for the artist, who shared his interest in applying Eastern philosophies to Western practices. Cage recognized that Graves's artistic process sought to reconcile our inner and outer realities and cultivate a “transcendent experience” that is “continually and everywhere offered, but [that] is most easily noticed where man has done least, as in the unfrequented parts of nature.” Cage emphasized that Graves's paintings “are not paintings.

He created more than two thousand printed images, working primarily in intaglio techniques but also, for extended periods, in lithography and linoleum cut. It was usually the influence of a master craftsman in a collaborative workshop that served as the impetus for Picasso's printmaking, as new techniques fueled his imagination. Picasso's early prints reflect his evolving artistic language and his place within the major modern movements. The Frugal Repast, of 1904, shown here in a richly inked proof from the shop of printer Auguste Delâtre, evokes a sense of mystery and nobility surrounding poverty, recalling the Symbolist aesthetic of Picasso's Blue and Rose periods. Two years later, a woodcut of his companion, Fernande Olivier, betrays the simplified forms he found in Iberian sculpture and a raw expressionism inspired by tribal art. Picasso's illustrations for Saint Matorel, with text by his friend Max Jacob, incorporate the Cubist idiom with which he is most closely associated. While this abstracted language of forms served him throughout his career, his work remained aligned with figurative imagery. In his great prints of the 1930s, created in collaboration with master printer Roger Lacourière, his allegorical inclinations are revealed, while these works also share Surrealist preoccupations with the unconscious. Well into his later years, Picasso remained open to the potential of a new technique. He discovered lithography in the 1940s, at the workshop of Fernand Mourlot in Paris. One monumental series created there, Woman in an Armchair, exists in thirty experimental variations. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he was stimulated by the possibilities of linoleum cut under the tutelage of Hidalgo Arnéra, a printer whose shop was near his studio in southern France. Innovations continued, as evidenced by the one-block process he devised for color printing, seen in the striking Still Life with Glass under the Lamp.","Pablo Picasso (0.975555), Printmaking (0.959416), Printing (0.796824), Cubism (0.679006), Lithography (0.672567), Georges Braque (0.625349), Symbolism (0.573106), Sculpture (0.538533)"

The distorted portrayals recall his artistic beginnings as a caricaturist. They also attest to a sophisticated experimentation with form. Feininger restructured space in a Cubist manner, combining multiple perspectives in the same composition and embracing the flattening and planar tendencies of the woodcut medium. Feininger based these woodcuts, which count among his first experiments in the medium, on quick sketches he termed “nature notes.” He made many of these sketches in summer 1918 while vacationing in the Harz Mountains, far away from wartime Berlin. PUBLISHING HISTORYIn 1937, American-born Feininger left Germany, where he had lived for fifty years, in the face of growing persecution by the Nazis. The Buchholz Gallery in New York, run by Curt Valentin, was instrumental in helping him reestablish himself stateside. In 1941, the gallery published this portfolio of selected early woodcuts, all printed from the original woodblocks, which Feininger had saved. The prints still resonated deeply with the artist, who only rarely made new woodcuts after returning to America.","Harz (0.946571), Harz National Park (0.913763)"

In his paintings and prints, he commented on the human condition, contrasting the noble and the ignoble, the rich and the poor, the powerful and the meek. With his monumental tome Miserere, Rouault explored themes of suffering and redemption that are reflected in his work overall. Miserere contains fifty-eight illustrations, which were first made as watercolors and oil paintings and then transferred to copperplates by means of photogravure. Rouault reworked these plates repeatedly over two decades, using aquatint, etching, and engraving to achieve rich blacks and grays. Originally titled Miserere et Guerre (Miserere and War), this book, a collaboration with the artist's dealer Ambroise Vollard, was begun in 1914 but not published until after Vollard's death in 1939. The Bible, Christian theology, popular French songs, Greco-Roman mythology, and the tragic context of World War I all served as sources for the moralistic and spiritualist content of Rouault's images for this project, as well as for the short captions that comprise the text. The plate shown here, which mocks a soldier in a stiff collar, exemplifies Rouault's critique of the vanity and arrogance of those who pursue power. The artist's often unorthodox use of techniques, learned in part from the many master printers with whom he worked, enabled him to achieve highly expressive effects. While he experimented widely with color, his choice of black-and-white illustrations for Miserere seems particularly fitting for the subject, and these prints remain his most admired today. Until 1940, when Rouault returned almost exclusively to painting, he completed approximately three hundred sixty-five prints, nearly half of which were published in illustrated books.","Painting (0.970468), Georges Rouault (0.695838), World War I (0.680848), Printmaking (0.640811), Expressionism (0.618234), Illustration (0.578177), World War II (0.538347), Etching (0.515618)"

In nine unremittingly caustic, clearly rendered illustrations, Grosz focuses on the corrupt nature of the pompous, overfed, and self-satisfied officers and officials who had dragged Germany into the cataclysm of World War I and who still governed the Weimar Republic. Grosz depicts the violent suppression of the working class by the ruling class. In Die Kommunisten fallen—und die Devisen steigen (Blood is the Best Sauce), uniformed soldiers beat unarmed protestors as an officer and a profiteer enjoy a decadent meal. Elsewhere, a dead body washing ashore does not disturb a soldier's cigarette break. Grosz sharpens his visual attacks with captions printed in three languages—English, French, and German. These statements are not always direct translations, but sometimes different phrases that together heighten Grosz's satirical attacks. ""Gott mit Uns"" (God with us), taken from the inscription on German soldiers' belt buckles, originally meant to invoke God's support, becomes in the English caption ""God for Us,"" a nationalist cry to smite the enemy. Grosz's political stance (as a communist) and intentions (working-class revolution) were obvious. Kurt Tucholsky, one of Weimar Germany's leading satirists, said of the portfolio, ""If drawings could kill, the Prussian military would certainly be dead.""

The title is an antiquated word for print that, more generally, translates as ""art paper."" Das Kunstblatt reflected the discerning taste of its founder and editor, Paul Westheim. In an opening salvo, Westheim explained that the true artist went beyond creating pretty, lifelike surfaces to probe ""the depths of being."" He named Edvard Munch, Emil Nolde, Ernst Barlach, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Oskar Kokoschka, Erich Heckel, and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner as exemplars of this modern ideal. Later, Das Kunstblatt provided equally impassioned support of sharply critical artists such as Otto Dix, George Grosz, and other practitioners of Neue Sachlichkeit. Leading novelists, playwrights, curators, and critics also contributed to the journal, including Bertolt Brecht, Theodor Däubler, Alfred Döblin, Carl Einstein, Gustav Hartlaub, and Franz Roh. From the beginning, Das Kunstblatt was international in scope, featuring works that satisfied Westheim's definitions of modern art no matter the source.

He also celebrates New York, capturing the city's energy through Expressionist spatial distortions and Futurist fracturing of the picture plane. Grosz's images of Berlin, by contrast, take a mordantly realistic approach. Grosz highlights the misery of working-class life; smoking factories are never far from view. Dive bars, with their dubious pleasures, are the only source of solace from the cold and desolate streets. It is no better at home, in cheap apartment blocks, where scenes of murder, prostitution, and suicide play out.The prints are photolithographs of drawings. Grosz showed little interest in exploring printmaking's technical and aesthetic possibilities. Instead, he exploited its reproducibility, printing large editions on a sliding scale: an inexpensive ""popular"" edition to reach mass audiences and a costly ""luxury"" edition, usually on better-quality paper.

The mother is visited by a blind beggar who has come to lead her son to a destiny that would benefit all mankind. Not wanting to lose her son, she kills the mystical horse which was to spirit him away. The horse's death causes the sun not to rise the following morning. Racked with guilt and despair, the mother takes her own life; her son, even then unable to free himself from her, soon follows. Rich with allusions to Christian and Nordic mythology, the play and its accompanying illustrations explore man's relationship to God, the key theme throughout Barlach's printmaking, sculpture, and writing. Der tote Tag was the first of seven plays Barlach wrote and illustrated for Paul Cassirer, his close friend, gallerist, and publisher. For the illustrations, Cassirer persuaded Barlach to make lithographs, the artist's first proper work in the medium. These prints capture the ominous and bleak atmosphere of the play, while spotlighting incidents—such as the mother slicing open the horse's throat—that are not detailed in the text.

A prolific printmaker, he completed eight hundred prints during his career, mostly employing lithography and etching techniques. He was introduced to printmaking through the Surrealist writers with whom he began collaborating in the early 1920s, and nearly half of his prints appeared in illustrated books. After recovering from the traumatic ordeal of trench warfare during World War I, Masson returned to Paris in 1920 and moved into a studio adjoining Joan Miró's on the rue Blomet. Masson's studio became a gathering place for young avant-garde writers and artists. By 1924 he had emerged on the Parisian art scene with an exhibition at Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler's Galerie Simon, from which André Breton, the charismatic leader of the Surrealists, purchased a painting. A self-described anarchist, Masson uncharacteristically accepted Breton's invitation to join the Surrealist group, although his relationship with them was stormy. Kahnweiler was the first to publish books pairing Surrealist artists and poets and, during the 1920s and early 1930s, he issued five books with illustrations by Masson and texts by such literary figures as Michel Leiris, Louis Aragon, and Georges Bataille. The volume C'est les bottes de 7 lieues, one of Masson's first ""automatist"" print projects, reflects his process of initially marking a plate with random gestures and then teasing out fragments of recognizable images.

The democratic nature of printmaking was therefore ideally suited to Bonnard, as the multiple impressions of a print could be experienced by a relatively broad audience. Additionally, he benefited from technical innovations in color lithography, his primary print medium, which had led to renewed interest in printmaking in the 1890s. Bonnard created more than one hundred twenty editioned projects between 1891 and 1947, including designs for theater programs, exhibition announcements, sheet music, book and journal illustration, and individual prints. His first poster commission, an advertisement for champagne, appeared in 1891 and was an immediate success. This was eventually followed by nine other posters, including this one for La Revue blanche, a Parisian periodical that published work by avant-garde writers and included prints by contemporary artists. This and Bonnard's other posters bear many of the same design hallmarks: unmodulated color, a playful depiction of flattened space, and a decorative handling of silhouettes and textures. A similar treatment of form and space is visible in The Little Laundry Girl, which depicts one of the thousands of women and girls employed by the Parisian laundry industry. It was one of twenty-two prints by various artists included in a portfolio issued by the renowned Parisian publisher Ambroise Vollard. Bonnard's other projects with Vollard included Parallèlement, one of six books illustrated by the artist.

As a German expatriate, he was imprisoned in the South of France for fourteen months after the outbreak of World War II in 1939. While in detention he made drawings and watercolors depicting fantastic landscapes and amorphous faces and figures that reflect the influence of children's art and the work of Paul Klee. After his release, Wols hid in Cassis, in unoccupied France. The artist never completely recovered from his war-related traumas, and the next decade, the last of his short life, was complicated by poverty, illness, and alcoholism. In 1945 Wols returned to Paris and began making small, abstract paintings using the automatic lines and drips of Surrealism in compositions typically based around a heavy central mass. The free-associative, hallucinatory quality of his work provides a link between that prewar movement and the gestural abstraction known generally as Art informel  that took hold in the years after. Wols was immediately viewed as a pioneer of this latter style, and the agitated nature of his markings seemed to give visual form to the existential anxiety of the postwar era.Wols's prints, a total of fifty-three drypoints created between 1945 and his death in 1951, comprise a distinct yet integral segment of his oeuvre. Nearly half were made as illustrations for books by Surrealist and Existential writers who befriended him, including Jean-Paul Sartre, Tristan Tzara, and René de Solier. The process of scratching directly on the plate with a drypoint needle was well-suited to Wols's compulsive style. The thin, scratchy lines with their characteristic burr capture all the microscopic details of his barbed, nestlike microcosms and the fuzzy tendrils of his insectlike forms.","Existentialism (0.977846), Modernism (0.888022), Surrealism (0.84186), Jean-Paul Sartre (0.776992), Martin Heidegger (0.670434), Sren Kierkegaard (0.669152), Abstract expressionism (0.658975), Tachisme (0.634978)"

The material too contributes: a blue-gray marble veined with flecks of flowing white, its surface intimates both movement through water and moving water itself.Brancusi was fascinated by animals, and believed in the primacy of animal consciousness. In reducing animals to elemental shapes, he felt he was approaching the essence of nature. Also, like a number of European artists of his period, he was excited by art from outside the classical tradition so influential in Western aesthetics. The art of Africa, Native America, and the Pacific, and also the art of prehistory (including Cycladic sculpture, a particular influence on Brancusi), took imaginative liberties with human and animal bodies, alternately exaggerating, attenuating, and eliminating their features. These examples liberated Brancusi and others in their treatment of form.

As late as 1937, in fact, he remarked, ""For my taste, there should be as little movement as possible in sculpture."" Yet within a year or so afterward he had conceived The River, a work in which the movement is almost reckless. Commissioned to create a monument to a notable pacifist, the French writer Henri Barbusse, Maillol conceived the sculpture as a work on the theme of war: a woman stabbed in the back, and falling. When the commission fell through, he transformed the idea into The River.

In Der erste Tag (The first day), God radiates power; softly rolling clouds part around his angular, blocky body, which was influenced by Gothic sculpture. Next, in Die Dome (The cathedrals), he surveys man-made creation. Der göttliche Bettler (The divine beggar) shows God, having descended to earth in the guise of a cripple, experiencing the brutality that has beset the land. Gott Bauch (God belly), which depicts a grotesque deity towering over uninterested men, manifests Barlach's disappointment that his contemporaries were interested more in physical than in spiritual fulfillment. In Totentanz II (Dance of death II) Barlach focuses on the redeeming power of love, which protects two figures from a terrifying crowd. Die Felsen (The rocks) and Der siebente Tag (The seventh day) portray God as a force as strong and eternal as the mountains.

The bold coloring and sharp angularity of his portraits, nudes, bathers, and cabaret performers helped define the German Expressionist aesthetic in painting and printmaking. During his lifetime, Heckel completed more than one thousand prints, the vast majority between 1905 and 1923. He made hundreds of etchings and lithographs, but is most acclaimed for his woodcuts, which display a radical flatness and simplification of form. He created Fränzi Reclining by sawing the woodblock into pieces, inking each part separately, and then reassembling them for printing, a jigsaw-puzzle technique derived from Edvard Munch, the Norwegian painter whose highly experimental approach to printmaking was emulated by Brücke artists. Heckel's model, twelve-year-old Fränzi, was a favorite of the Brücke members; they responded to her awkward poses, so typical of adolescence and so unlike those of conventional models. The exaggerated masklike features of her face were inspired in part by the artist's study of African sculptures at the Dresden Ethnological Museum. After moving from Dresden to Berlin in 1911, along with other Brücke artists, Heckel turned increasingly to themes of melancholy and isolation. By 1913 the Brücke group had disbanded, and in 1915 Heckel went off to war. Portrait of a Man, a gaunt self-portrait created in the difficult months just after the war ended, manifests a psychic weariness that may be interpreted as broadly symbolic of the German people at that time. Technically, it demonstrates Heckel's ongoing eagerness to experiment with printmaking processes. The colored areas were applied to the wood with a brush rather than with the more common ink roller. The thick brushstrokes create a painterly surface that contrasts with the deliberate flatness in his earlier work.","Expressionism (0.981965), Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (0.636293), Woodcut (0.621191), Die Brcke (0.613478), Degenerate art (0.450569), Karl Schmidt-Rottluff (0.42961), Printmaking (0.39963), Fritz Bleyl (0.393337)"

His best-known works are elongated bronze figures either standing or striding. Their isolation and often haunting qualities have been interpreted in Existential terms, most notably by the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. The figures in his signature paintings and drawings, rendered within dense webs of sketchy lines, are also enigmatic.Giacometti created more than three hundred fifty prints, two-thirds of which appear in illustrated books and are collaborations with such friends as André Breton, Georges Bataille, and René Char. He worked in etching and lithography, mainly depicting people close to him or recording studio views of his own sculptures and paintings. His most active period as a printmaker coincided with his renewed focus on painting in the 1950s, when he received invitations from a variety of publishers, including Aimé Maeght of Paris, and Kornfeld and Klipstein of Bern. His introduction to intaglio printmaking occurred in the early 1930s during a brief stay at Stanley William Hayter's Atelier 17 in Paris, an experimental workshop and celebrated meeting place for artists. The result was two highly distinctive and rare engravings related directly to his sculpture of the period. To make Cubist Head, Giacometti gouged sharp angles and parallel lines into a copperplate, creating in two dimensions a fractured and faceted face similar to that of his sculpture of the same title, issued in marble and in bronze in 1934. In the print Hands Holding a Void, Giacometti comments on another of his sculptures, here surrounding it in an atmospheric field of ink tone that reads as an isolating void, made even more eerie by the random markings left from pits and scratches on the copperplate.","Printmaking (0.988292), Sculpture (0.674082), Jean-Paul Sartre (0.640515), Pablo Picasso (0.551364), Surrealism (0.517957), Alberto Giacometti (0.504552), Friedrich Nietzsche (0.484015), Existentialism (0.476446)"

In Isabel, Lachaise seems to have seen greater forces and principles of human life: ""You are,"" he once told her, ""the Goddess I am searching to express in all things.""Like many twentieth-century sculptors, Lachaise wanted to escape the classical tradition, and some of his smaller, more private works distend and exaggerate parts of the female body in ways that recall the swollen forms of Paleolithic fertility figures.

The democratic nature of printmaking was therefore ideally suited to Bonnard, as the multiple impressions of a print could be experienced by a relatively broad audience. Additionally, he benefited from technical innovations in color lithography, his primary print medium, which had led to renewed interest in printmaking in the 1890s. Bonnard created more than one hundred twenty editioned projects between 1891 and 1947, including designs for theater programs, exhibition announcements, sheet music, book and journal illustration, and individual prints. His first poster commission, an advertisement for champagne, appeared in 1891 and was an immediate success. This was eventually followed by nine other posters, including this one for La Revue blanche, a Parisian periodical that published work by avant-garde writers and included prints by contemporary artists. This and Bonnard's other posters bear many of the same design hallmarks: unmodulated color, a playful depiction of flattened space, and a decorative handling of silhouettes and textures. A similar treatment of form and space is visible in The Little Laundry Girl, which depicts one of the thousands of women and girls employed by the Parisian laundry industry. It was one of twenty-two prints by various artists included in a portfolio issued by the renowned Parisian publisher Ambroise Vollard. Bonnard's other projects with Vollard included Parallèlement, one of six books illustrated by the artist. Bonnard's masterful integration of his sensual lithographs with Paul Verlaine's erotic love poems has made Parallèlement a seminal example of the deluxe livre de peintre.Originally from TextEntryID 69388 (TextTypeID 127) His first poster commission, an advertisement for champagne, appeared in 1891 and was an immediate success (see page 13).","Ukiyo-e (0.957565), Printing (0.954483), Lithography (0.895071), Woodcut (0.88412), Les Nabis (0.825036), Aesthetics (0.785054), Woodblock printing (0.777571), Pierre Bonnard (0.756035)"

In conception, his papiers collés are closer to paintings than are the sparely drawn compositions of his forerunners; unlike them Gris covers the whole surface with pasted papers and paint. In works such as Breakfast, Gris's use of printed papers is more literal than theirs: the wood-grained fragments usually follow some of the contours of a table and are therefore integral to the composition; and his perspectival cues are relatively legible and precise. His superimposed drawings of domestic objects, fragmented yet softly modeled and most often seen from above, combine to create a more representational pictorial composition than those of Braque and Picasso.Despite these observations, Breakfast is full of troubling contradictions. The striped wallpaper background spills across the table; certain objects (a glass on the left, a bottle in the upper right) appear as ghostly presences; the coffeepot is disjointed; the tobacco packet is painted and drawn in photographically realistic trompe l'oeil, but its label is real. Thus, while aspects of domestic comfort are captured in this image, Gris also raises many subjective and objective questions about how reality is perceived.","Pablo Picasso (0.980821), Cubism (0.818757), Georges Braque (0.776737), Collage (0.640875), Juan Gris (0.605539), Paper (0.509018), Henri Matisse (0.488817), Painting (0.481772)"

As early as 1910, Kraus asked Oskar Kokoschka to make illustrations for a book edition. Kraus saw Kokoschka as a kindred spirit, someone who also exposed hypocrisy and rejected conventions in his work.Sigel's naked, strangled body had been found stuffed in a trunk in an apartment above a Chinese restaurant, along with 2,000 love letters from her and many other upper-class white women who had supposedly been seduced by the waiter suspected of the murder. Sigel had met him in the mission in Chinatown where she worked. The sexual and racial overtones of the events prompted salacious coverage in the press, and these distortions were the real subject of Kraus's story. Kokoschka's prints have little to do with the murder. Instead, the eight lithographs are set in a place far away from New York and show the artist with Alma Mahler, one of fin-de-siècle Vienna's most extraordinary women.

Kokoschka remained infatuated with her, even after she rebuffed his marriage proposal and aborted his child. The pianist Leo Kestenberg, a friend of Kokoschka's, first played the cantata for him, but Kokoschka insisted it was the libretto, not Bach's music, that prompted him to make the prints.Bach's cantata presents a dialogue between Fear and Hope. In these prints, Kokoschka casts himself in the role of Hope, while Mahler plays Fear. Guided by Fear, Hope sets down a road that leads to his death (although the cantata itself sounds a positive note of divine salvation). Throughout, Kokoschka cites earlier works and weaves in biographical allusions to his relationship with Mahler. The imagery in Drachen über einer Flamme (Dragons over a flame) recalls his attempts to protect the pregnant Mahler from seeing frightening reptiles, while the final print reprises imagery from the poster for his earlier play Mörderer, Hoffnung der Frauen (Murderer, hope of woman). In the penultimate print, Kokoschka depicts himself standing in a grave, an acknowledgement of guilt for the failed relationship. As he later stated, ""I am in the grave, slain by own my jealousy.""In printmaking, Kokoschka preferred lithography for its directness and the rich range of tonal values that he could wrest from the lithographic crayon.

He created more than two thousand printed images, working primarily in intaglio techniques but also, for extended periods, in lithography and linoleum cut. It was usually the influence of a master craftsman in a collaborative workshop that served as the impetus for Picasso's printmaking, as new techniques fueled his imagination. Picasso's early prints reflect his evolving artistic language and his place within the major modern movements. The Frugal Repast, of 1904, evokes a sense of mystery and nobility surrounding poverty, recalling the Symbolist aesthetic of Picasso's Blue and Rose periods. Two years later, a woodcut of his companion, Fernande Olivier, betrays the simplified forms he found in Iberian sculpture and a raw expressionism inspired by tribal art. Picasso's illustrations for Saint Matorel, with text by his friend Max Jacob, incorporate the Cubist idiom with which he is most closely associated. While this abstracted language of forms served him throughout his career, his work remained aligned with figurative imagery. In his great prints of the 1930s, created in collaboration with master printer Roger Lacourière, his allegorical inclinations are revealed, while these works also share Surrealist preoccupations with the unconscious. Well into his later years, Picasso remained open to the potential of a new technique. He discovered lithography in the 1940s, at the workshop of Fernand Mourlot in Paris. One monumental series created there, Woman in an Armchair, exists in thirty experimental variations.

Oblivious lovers dance while the figure War slumbers, threatening to awake at any moment. Demagogues rise. Children refuse to eat their soup. Beckmann here revisited subjects he had explored throughout his career, suggesting that nothing changes and everything comes back. Beckmann depicted himself throughout the portfolio, appearing as a figure who has seen and experienced it all. In the final print, he stands as Pontius Pilate across from the crucified Jesus. After another world war, Beckmann held little hope for salvation—for himself or for humanity. PUBLISHING HISTORYIn 1946, the New York gallerist Curt Valentin commissioned Beckmann to make a portfolio of prints for the American market. Valentin, a German expatriate and instrumental supporter of artists persecuted by the Nazis, left the choices of subject matter and medium to the artist. Beckmann, who had not made prints since 1942, responded enthusiastically to the offer, writing to Valentin that he was ""teeming with ideas.""

In 1945 he changed his surname from Jørgensen to Jorn to reflect a multinational outlook and to emphasize his affiliation with the larger European community. While traveling in Europe, he met Dutch painter George Constant and Belgian poet Christian Dotremont, leading to the formation of CoBrA in 1948. (CoBrA is an acronym for Copenhagen, Brussels, and Amsterdam.) After a sojourn in Paris in the late 1930s, Jorn returned to Denmark, where he began his formal study of printmaking at the Copenhagen School of Graphics of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. Focusing on lithography and etching, he eventually made some four hundred thirty prints in the course of his career, many in a series format such as 8 Lithographs and others as illustrations for books and periodicals. Jorn worked with major printers and publishers in Europe, such as Jens Christian Sørensen in Copenhagen, Erker Presse in St. Gallen, Switzerland, and Imprimerie Clot, Bramsen et Georges in Paris. These lithographs demonstrate Jorn's experiments with spontaneous line and semi-figurative representation, two fundamental aspects of the CoBrA visual language. They stand at the edge of abstraction but do not quite embrace it. The agitated and chaotic linear network and the rhythmic sense of movement express a raw energy that Jorn sought to release, a force associated more with ""primitive"" art forms than with the unconscious realm explored by the Surrealists. The anthropomorphic and animistic phantoms suggested here and throughout Jorn's work populate an imaginary microcosm he called ""Caosmos."" His creatures and birdlike figures emerge from Nordic legends and mythologies but also occasionally refer to aspects of his personal life.","Printmaking (0.960239), European Union (0.861809), COBRA (0.834955), Europe (0.824368), Art (0.805281), Asger Jorn (0.746347), The Copenhagen School (0.707218), Belgium (0.697206)"

Trained in Paris in the 1890s, he was one of the first American painters to assimilate contemporary trends in modern European painting. His use of flat, abstract fields of pure color, decorative patterning, boldly contoured forms, and unusual angles and framing devices is associated with Post-Impressionism. His influences include James McNeill Whistler, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, and the Nabi artists, as well as Japanese prints and French posters. Prendergast confined his interest in printmaking to the monotype technique and, through his consistent use of multiple colors, promoted the idea of the fine-art color print to the general public. He described his process in 1905: ""Paint on copper in oils, wiping parts to be white. When picture suits you, place on it Japanese paper and either press in a press or rub with a spoon till it pleases you."" Prendergast is thought to have created approximately two hundred monotypes between 1891 and 1902, although somewhat fewer are known today. In his overall oeuvre, they stand between his delicate, early watercolors and his rough, late, impasto oils. Requiring rapid execution, the monotype process lends itself to loose, gestural brushwork, as in the two prints shown here. In Orange Market, thought to be based on fruitstands in Venice, light infuses the composition wherever the paper shows through the paint, creating distinct highlights. The umbrella motif, the central horizon line, and the border recall elements in Japanese prints. Comparable effects are visible in The Rehearsal, which demonstrates Prendergast's interest in motifs related to entertainment, including the ballet and the circus.","Vincent van Gogh (0.986065), Post-Impressionism (0.884182), Painting (0.833724), Fauvism (0.635181), Paul Gauguin (0.61763), Western painting (0.585638), Impressionism (0.583124), History of painting (0.57607)"

For Hasids, animals were also humanity's link to the universe, and the painting's large circular forms suggest the orbiting sun, moon (in eclipse at the lower left), and earth.The geometries of I and the Village are inspired by the broken planes of Cubism, but Chagall's is a personalized version.

Conversely, in Paris he used a disjunctive geometric structure to carry him back home. Where Cubism was mainly an art of urban avant-garde society, I and the Village is nostalgic and magical, a rural fairy tale: objects jumble together, scale shifts abruptly, and a woman and two houses, at the painting's top, stand upside-down.

In Lautensack's poem, written in 1915 while he was stationed with the German Army on the Baltic coast, the incursions of modern life—soldiers and telegraph poles—have barely touched the timeless, vast landscape of the Samland peninsula, an area of shifting dunes and desolate beaches at the eastern reach of Prussia. Pechstein, who knew this area well from his repeated stays in nearby Nidden, captured the essence of Lautensack's verse in twenty-one lithographs of bathers, frolicking horses, storm-tossed boats, and rustic Baltic architecture. Pechstein populated his raw northern landscapes with figures influenced by African tribal sculpture and Oceanic art, which were key sources in the Expressionist quest for authenticity and rejuvenation.

Trapped in France from 1936 to 1940, the artist embarked on these obsessively meticulous works on paper in an attempt to commune with nature and escape the tragedies of current events. Despite their modest formats, they represented the most important works of his career up to that time, a fact he quickly realized.The first eleven works in the series were executed in Normandy between December 1939 and May 1940. Although the motifs throughout correspond to Miró's classic repertory, in the earlier works the washed grounds are more saturated, the motifs larger, and the compositions looser than in those that would follow. In the later thirteen works, executed in Palma de Mallorca in 1940–41, of which The Beautiful Bird Revealing the Unknown to a Pair of Lovers is exemplary, the grounds are almost opalescent, and the familiar motifs are smaller and tightly woven into a continuous linear web.

Carl Zigrosser of the Weyhe Gallery in New York encouraged Siqueiros to make lithographs while he was exhibiting his work in the city during the 1930s. All in all, the artist made some twenty-five lithographs and a range of woodcuts during his career. Like those of Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco, Siqueiros's lithographs were intended for North American collectors, while his woodcuts had a much broader reach in Mexico, appearing as illustrations in political magazines. After working for several years in Europe, Siqueiros returned to Mexico City in 1922 to join a group of young artists developing a national mural program. A high-profile Communist party leader and union organizer, Siqueiros edited El Machete, the artists' union news sheet. It was there that he published his manifesto proclaiming easel painting irrelevant and elitist, and where his popular woodcut illustrations in the tradition of Mexico's José Guadalupe Posada appeared. This portrait lithograph was completed after Siqueiros's six-month incarceration for Communist activities, while he was living in Taxco under ""town arrest."" Like other lithographs published by the Weyhe Gallery, this one was made by transporting drawings, printing proofs, and possibly even lithographic stones back and forth between the United States and Mexico.

In addition to paintings, Klee made more than one hundred prints, most of which were etchings and lithographs. His interest in printmaking began in his mid-twenties when he returned to his hometown of Bern after studying art at the Munich Academy and in Italy. Determined to make his first independent artistic statement, Klee found that etching provided the structure he needed at a moment when he was discouraged by his unsuccessful efforts at painting. Between 1903 and 1905 Klee made a series of twelve etchings he called Inventions, which he considered his first significant body of work. Rebelling against the classical training he had received at art school, he radically distorted the anatomy of the female nude in this series. By parodying the typically allegorical treatment of women's bodies, he expressed his alienation from the bourgeois conservatism of mainstream art and his desire to retreat into his imagination. In this example, the woman, draped over a gnarled tree and grotesquely misshapen, is portrayed as the antithesis of a romantic, idealized nude. This early series of etchings established Klee as an artist and launched his career. Although he later devoted himself to painting, he continued to make prints in which he incorporated ideas from Cubism and the art of children and of the mentally ill. A trip to Tunisia in 1914 awakened a passion for color, which he incorporated in his paintings and prints. It was at the Bauhaus, the famed German school of modern design, where he was invited to teach in 1920, that he developed his more familiar abstract geometric style, utilizing signs and symbols in simplified yet whimsical compositions such as Queen of Hearts.","Paul Klee (0.94889), Painting (0.834182), Wassily Kandinsky (0.750654), Bauhaus (0.666415), Printmaking (0.626013), Expressionism (0.618009), Cubism (0.606935), Munich (0.557031)"

In 1927, after moving from London to Paris and studying engraving with the artist Joseph Hecht, he founded his own workshop, which he named Atelier 17 in 1933 after its new street address. In 1940, with the outbreak of war, Atelier 17 moved to New York and became a meeting place for exiled European artists and American artists working in various styles. The workshop was transplanted back to Paris in the 1950s. Hayter's induction into Surrealist practice in the late 1920s established the unconscious as a source of his art. His noteworthy contributions to printmaking include an expressive and flexible engraved line that was influenced by automatism; a textural depth created through etching; and innovations in color printing on a single plate. Although Hayter also worked as a painter, it was his printed oeuvre, consisting of some four hundred fifty works, and his celebrated Atelier 17 that influenced countless artists who then disseminated his methods of intaglio printmaking. The plate for Combat was one of the few that Hayter brought from Paris to New York in 1939, prior to opening his Atelier 17 there a year later. Not only was it the largest plate he made in the 1930s, but it also went through ten states, a large number for Hayter. Engraved in 1936, Combat takes as its subject the Spanish Civil War, an event reflected in the work of many artists at the time. Although not immediately discernible, figures constructed from sinuous lines fill the composition, and the etching and engraving processes are exploited to suggest a sense of depth. According to Hayter, the print depicts a violent encounter of combatants, with leaping horses and a plethora of weapons.","Printmaking (0.952548), Engraving (0.540968), Stanley William Hayter (0.510106), Intaglio (0.476203), Etching (0.466968), Drypoint (0.404351), Old master print (0.395918), Printing (0.388655)"

They aspired to establish a new vision of art and culture based on the dissolution of the boundaries between art and life.Though the idealistic search for a new experimental aesthetic inspired their collaboration, the Brücke artists also chose to make prints to promote their work in a competitive art market. They designed a variety of printed matter to assert their identity, and used them to recruit ""passive members""  art collectors and patrons  to support, sponsor and disseminate their work.This manifesto, the first written statement of the groups ideals, appealed to ""a generation of those who create and take pleasure,"" and expressed the Brücke artists' desire for a ""direct and genuine"" approach to representation. The Jugendstil-inspired typography, including the ornamental initial and the artist's monogram ""ELK,"" reveals Kirchner's training in the applied arts and crafts with Hugo Steiner–Prag in Munich. In the Brücke title vignette, which also shows a Jugendstil influence, a bridge is used to represent the group's aspiration to create a new community united by a shared creative consciousness and artistic imagination.Although, the Brücke artists used a slightly earlier, typeset version of the manifesto as a kind of handbill for potential buyers, this hand–carved version with the title vignette was intended as a special gift to their ""passive members"" they began to recruit in 1906.","Expressionism (0.981928), Die Brcke (0.874243), Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (0.786297), Degenerate art (0.677732), Art (0.647507), Karl Schmidt-Rottluff (0.639184), German painters (0.582319), Fritz Bleyl (0.571403)"

Although he began his career working in a theatrical Post-Impressionist style, Beckmann's harrowing experience as a medical orderly in World War I transformed his art into one of compressed angular arrangements, peopled with the disaffected and disenfranchised of Germany's postwar society. In biblical scenes, crowded café pictures, circus tableaux, and self-portraits, he reflected the unrelenting anxiety and alienation he perceived in modern life. Beckmann completed more than three hundred seventy prints, the vast majority between the years 1915 and 1924. He began his prolific career with lithography. Just before the war, however, he discovered that drypoint, which enabled him to create staccato marks and scratchy textures, matched his nervous, agitated state. Working without the aid of preliminary drawings, he attacked the plates directly, often pulling proofs on his personal press before sending the plates to be editioned. Although he essentially divided his printmaking between lithography and drypoint, Beckmann also tried his hand at woodcut. He completed only nineteen but their bold contrasts, abrupt croppings, and disengaged gazes make them among his most powerful graphic statements on the theme of isolation in the modern urban environment. Beckmann's early successes as a painter attracted some of Germany's leading publishers, including Reinhard Piper in Munich and J. B. Neumann in Berlin, who commissioned the artist's major print portfolios. The series format provided Beckmann with the perfect vehicle to explore his allegorical narratives. In Night from the portfolio Hell he portrays the violence and decadence surrounding the Berlin riots of November 1918 and the founding of the Weimar Republic. With Mannerist distortion and foreshortened perspective he depicts the horrific scene in a stagelike setting, implicating the viewer as the audience of this ugly spectacle.","World War II (0.978599), Printmaking (0.965221), World War I (0.818014), Germany (0.753661), Weimar Republic (0.718085), Drawing (0.699315), Western painting (0.654185), Intaglio (0.630879)"

Hirshfield was greatly influenced by the painting, but he was dissatisfied with Rousseau's treatment of the female figure, finding its contours overly rounded, and he proposed a different type of nude in response. In this work a woman stands facing a mirror that, instead of reflecting the front of her body, shows her back. The symmetry of the doubled body shapes, the highly stylized flowers at the woman's feet, and the ambiguously rendered interior space, with no clear distinction between wall and floor, work together to form a kind of surface pattern across the canvas. Though Hirshfield did not paint from live models, he was particularly interested in the anatomical details of the female figure and felt his renderings were ""better than a camera could do.""","Museum of Modern Art (0.965568), Henri Rousseau (0.858484), Woman (0.795849), Henri Matisse (0.738944), History of painting (0.691071), Girl (0.646609), Modern art (0.633773), Modernism (0.604445)"

Both his teacher, Robert Henri, and his supervisor at the Socialist journal The New Masses, artist John Sloan, taught him to record everyday life in a realist mode. Following the Armory Show, however, Davis began to experiment with reconciling abstraction and representation. Davis's entire printed oeuvre consists of twenty-seven works, mostly lithographs, created between 1915 and 1964. While in Paris in the late 1920s, he made his first prints, most likely at the renowned lithography workshop of Edmond Desjobert, where other American artists gathered. When Davis returned to the United States in 1931, he began work on five lithographs, three of which are illustrated here. They represent his mature style and his most accomplished efforts in printmaking. Exploiting lithography's potential for rich blacks and contrasting grays against a background of white paper, Davis suggests a sense of visual syncopation in his overall compositional structure. This creative manipulation of the medium was probably achieved with the guidance of the distinguished American printer, George C. Miller.Davis's ability to express the dynamic atmosphere of the American scene is evident in all three prints. Planar and curvilinear abstract forms are combined with references to commercial culture. Barber Shop Chord and Theatre on the Beach, both amalgams of the imaginary and the real, include motifs from Davis's seaside retreat in Gloucester, Massachusetts, but the latter also incorporates the facade of a Parisian theater and a figure suggesting a cellist. Sixth Avenue El refers primarily to New York City. These lithographs were exhibited at the Downtown Gallery, one of the primary venues of the day for contemporary American art, and received critical acclaim.","Armory Show (0.970341), Robert Henri (0.924297), John French Sloan (0.836095), New York City (0.718073), Printing (0.625051), Printmaking (0.619596), American modernism (0.608434), United States (0.577216)"

In search of a more vital and authentic way of life, he made his first sojourn to Tahiti in 1891. Although the island was not the untouched Eden he had hoped for, he was still greatly inspired by the people, culture, and lifestyle there, and these new influences were reflected in his paintings, sculptures, and drawings. After he returned to Europe in 1893, he began working on Noa Noa (Tahitian for ""fragrance""), a book project based on his Tahitian experience and illustrated with woodcuts that were meant to make his new art more understandable to his contemporaries. Although never realized in their intended form, both the text and the ten woodcuts for Noa Noa survive among Gauguin's seventy-eight printed compositions in woodcut, etching, and lithography. The Noa Noa woodcuts illustrate everything that drew Gauguin to printmaking. Although the woodcut had seen a modest revival in the nineteenth century, no example matched the audacity of Gauguin's approach to the medium, which allowed him to work on a natural, ""primitive"" matrix, creating works that combined the sculptural gouging of his carved wood low reliefs with the evocative color of his paintings. It also provided seemingly endless opportunity for experimentation. Gauguin printed Noa Noa blocks with various inkings and color combinations, on different papers, and sometimes slightly off-register to create a blurred, dreamlike image, as in The Gods. In addition to the Noa Noa woodcuts printed by the artist, impressions were also pulled by the professional printer Louis Roy during the artist's lifetime; others were produced posthumously by Gauguin's son, Pola, and by others.","Printmaking (0.950776), Woodcut (0.82232), Paul Gauguin (0.661054), French Polynesia (0.639432), Old master print (0.600526), Tahiti (0.598334), Etching (0.537958), Sculpture (0.510926)"

With the aim of making Rivera's work more widely available to collectors in North America, Carl Zigrosser, the director of the Weyhe Gallery in New York, encouraged him to make lithographs while he was in the city working on his 1931 retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art. Throughout his career Rivera made only fourteen prints, most of which were lithographs published by the Weyhe Gallery, and a single linoleum cut he made in Mexico City in 1938. In 1921, working in Mexico with the support of the Mexican government, Rivera began to develop his mural style aimed at the proletariat. During the early 1930s, his popularity in the United States led to major mural commissions in New York, Detroit, and San Francisco. This lithograph, printed in New York, is based on a detail from a fresco cycle at the Palace of Cortés in Cuernavaca, depicting the history of Mexico. In it Rivera shows the revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata during the Mexican Revolution of 1910. Zapata, who became a national icon, is shown holding the reins of a horse whose aristocratic owner lies dead at his feet. A group of campesinos (peasants) wearing white dress shirts follow him. This scene from the fresco was repainted by Rivera for his 1931 exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art and is now in the Museum's permanent collection.

Both his teacher, Robert Henri, and his supervisor at the Socialist journal The New Masses, artist John Sloan, taught him to record everyday life in a realist mode. Following the Armory Show, however, Davis began to experiment with reconciling abstraction and representation. Davis's entire printed oeuvre consists of twenty-seven works, mostly lithographs, created between 1915 and 1964. While in Paris in the late 1920s, he made his first prints, most likely at the renowned lithography workshop of Edmond Desjobert, where other American artists gathered. When Davis returned to the United States in 1931, he began work on five lithographs, three of which are illustrated here. They represent his mature style and his most accomplished efforts in printmaking. Exploiting lithography's potential for rich blacks and contrasting grays against a background of white paper, Davis suggests a sense of visual syncopation in his overall compositional structure. This creative manipulation of the medium was probably achieved with the guidance of the distinguished American printer, George C. Miller. Davis's ability to express the dynamic atmosphere of the American scene is evident in all three prints. Planar and curvilinear abstract forms are combined with references to commercial culture. Barber Shop Chord and Theatre on the Beach, both amalgams of the imaginary and the real, include motifs from Davis's seaside retreat in Gloucester, Massachusetts, but the latter also incorporates the facade of a Parisian theater and a figure suggesting a cellist. Sixth Avenue El refers primarily to New York City. These lithographs were exhibited at the Downtown Gallery, one of the primary venues of the day for contemporary American art, and received critical acclaim.","Armory Show (0.969305), Robert Henri (0.922301), John French Sloan (0.833974), New York City (0.714895), Printing (0.622601), Printmaking (0.618783), American modernism (0.608074), United States (0.572585)"

A landmark hotel in New York City at the time, the Delmonico was a towering midtown skyscraper, admired for its setback form. The building typifies the kind of structure that Sheeler and other American artists working in the hard-edged, planar, and geometric style known as Cubist-Realism, and later called Precisionism, found inspiring. In the teens, Sheeler made the transition from academically trained painter to cutting-edge modernist through his interest in industrial design and his work as an architectural photographer, along with his exposure to contemporary European art. The artist is not known to have used a photograph as the basis for Delmonico Building, but the subject, unusual vantage point, and use of light relate to his work on the 1920 film Manhatta, a collaboration with photographer Paul Strand that evokes the dynamism of early-twentieth-century New York through avant-garde film techniques. The lithograph Yachts relates to another project that Sheeler had planned with Strand in the 1920s, a film about the New York Yacht Club. Although the film never materialized, Sheeler completed an oil painting and a drawing on the subject in 1922. The print, made two years later, further refines the graceful forms of these earlier works through an elegant use of abstracted detail and subtle handling of gray tones. In only three additional lithographs, Sheeler chose as subjects a barn, a still life, and an industrial landscape, again crystallizing studies of form first explored in other mediums. He made all five of his lithographs between 1918 and 1928 at the workshop of George C.

Between 1891 and 1904, he made approximately one hundred etchings for a publisher of calendars, illustrated books, and novelty items. After taking classes with Ash Can School painter Robert Henri, a proponent of realistic depictions of everyday life, Sloan applied these lessons to his printmaking when he embarked on the series New York City Life in 1905–06. Despite critical acclaim for the ten etchings in this series, the public found them too risqué, and Sloan initially exhibited and sold few of them. One of these prints, Turning Out the Light, is an example of the sort of innuendo that some viewers found objectionable. However, in choosing ordinary people for his subjects, Sloan was following the example of artists he admired, including Goya, Dürer, Rembrandt, and Hogarth, as well as contemporary illustrators. In fact, a humanitarian outlook informed much of his art, and part of the appeal of printmaking for him was that it made art more affordable and accessible. As art editor for the Socialist magazine The New Masses from 1910 to 1914, he also published many political and satirical drawings. Primarily between 1891 and 1937, Sloan completed more than three hundred etchings, as well as a few prints in other mediums, before turning almost exclusively to painting. For printmaking, he usually drew from memory and then worked on his plates with various tools and chemicals, evolving his imagery through several states. Subway Stairs, for example, went through seven such states before Sloan settled on the version shown here. As the demand for his prints rose, he sometimes enlisted the services of professional printers to help print the edition.","Robert Henri (0.954685), John French Sloan (0.931853), Ashcan School (0.836936), Printmaking (0.826488), American realism (0.768068), Etching (0.725448), Printing (0.668375), William Glackens (0.659622)"

Hopper had also been to France, where he admired the etchings of Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, and Charles Meryon. Initially a commercial illustrator, Hopper contributed to the Socialist magazine The New Masses, when his friend, the masterful etcher Sloan, was art editor there from 1910 to 1914. The following year, with the help of the artist Martin Lewis, Hopper began making prints. Between 1915 and 1928 he made seventy etchings and drypoints before turning exclusively to painting. During those formative years, intaglio prints earned Hopper recognition as well as sales, and he bought his own press so that he could experiment in his studio and print as the demand arose. The subjects most identified with Hopper are empty settings—an isolated house, a vacant room, an abandoned street. Mystery and psychological tension are evoked through the manipulation of light, unusual vantage points, and dramatically simplified compositions. When figures are included, they are often alone, engulfed in a sense of solitude or dwarfed by their physical environment. Hopper also depicted trains, such as The Locomotive, which monumentalizes the steam engine while literally marginalizing and cutting off one figure standing at the left. The brightly lit overpass and darkened tunnel ahead exemplify Hopper's symbolic use of light and architecture. In Night Shadows, the view of a lone figure from a high vantage point adds an atmosphere of suspense. Both prints demonstrate the vigorous cross-hatching, deeply bitten lines, and heavy inking that are typical of Hopper's etchings.

Between 1891 and 1904, he made approximately one hundred etchings for a publisher of calendars, illustrated books, and novelty items. After taking classes with Ash Can School painter Robert Henri, a proponent of realistic depictions of everyday life, Sloan applied these lessons to his printmaking when he embarked on the series New York City Life in 1905-06. Despite critical acclaim for the ten etchings in this series, the public found them too risqué, and Sloan initially exhibited and sold few of them. One of these prints, Turning Out the Light, is an example of the sort of innuendo that some viewers found objectionable. However, in choosing ordinary people for his subjects, Sloan was following the example of artists he admired, including Goya, Dürer, Rembrandt, and Hogarth, as well as contemporary illustrators. In fact, a humanitarian outlook informed much of his art, and part of the appeal of printmaking for him was that it made art more affordable and accessible. As art editor for the Socialist magazine The New Masses from 1910 to 1914, he also published many political and satirical drawings. Primarily between 1891 and 1937, Sloan completed more than three hundred etchings, as well as a few prints in other mediums, before turning almost exclusively to painting. For printmaking, he usually drew from memory and then worked on his plates with various tools and chemicals, evolving his imagery through several states. Subway Stairs, for example, went through seven such states before Sloan settled on the version shown here. As the demand for his prints rose, he sometimes enlisted the services of professional printers to help print the edition.","Robert Henri (0.954685), John French Sloan (0.931853), Ashcan School (0.836936), Printmaking (0.826488), American realism (0.768068), Etching (0.725448), Printing (0.668375), William Glackens (0.659622)"

After a discouraging experience studying academic painting in Paris, he returned to his hometown of Bordeaux, where he began making etchings in 1864. Later, returning to Paris, he was encouraged by a fellow artist to try lithography and was introduced to Lemercier, a renowned Parisian workshop. He soon discovered that the unique qualities of this technique enabled him to achieve infinite gradations of tone, fine-line drawing, and rich depictions of light and dark. Also, through the possibility of editioning, he found a vehicle for broadly distributing the intimate imagery of his drawings. During his lifetime, Redon made close to thirty etchings and two hundred lithographs, working almost exclusively in black and white. His reputation flourished, due, in part, to the availability of his prints. He became a celebrated figure in fin-de-siècle Paris, greatly admired by artists and writers of the Symbolist movement with whom he shared an enthusiasm for the fantastic, mystical, and sublime forces found beneath the surface of everyday life. Using nature as his starting point, Redon imagined new worlds through his enigmatic creations, such as The Eye Like a Strange Balloon Mounts Toward Infinity.The majority of Redon's lithographs are found in albums based on thematic or literary subjects. He was greatly inspired by such authors as Edgar Allan Poe and Gustave Flaubert, whose unusual sensibilities were well suited to the artist's own. Redon was so moved by Flaubert's 1874 prose poem The Temptation of Saint Anthony that he created three separate projects based on it.","Edgar Allan Poe (0.977222), Symbolism (0.937429), Odilon Redon (0.828185), Lithography (0.633681), Drawing (0.617914), Poetry (0.6011), Eureka: A Prose Poem (0.532898), Les Nabis (0.526134)"

This was never realized, but the sharp colors, fantastic imagery, and precise outlines in his work—derived from the style and subject matter of popular print culture—struck a chord with a younger generation of avant-garde painters. Rousseau described the subject of The Sleeping Gypsy thus: ""A wandering Negress, a mandolin player, lies with her jar beside her (a vase with drinking water), overcome by fatigue in a deep sleep. A lion chances to pass by, picks up her scent yet does not devour her.

To combat this deadly fixity and to work in what he called the “mode of succession over time,” Survage prepared sheet after sheet of abstract watercolors. His first goal in these works was to “animate” his painting, his second to create an abstract color film. At the time, such a project was on the edge of technological possibility, and the film was never realized. Even so, the serial structures of Survage's watercolors, with each image imagined as one frame in a continuous animation, introduce the dimension of time and rhythm to their colored forms.","Cubism (0.977884), Modernism (0.643307), Guillaume Apollinaire (0.631945), Surrealism (0.574886), Dada (0.57087), Painting (0.545544), Art critic (0.54118), Pablo Picasso (0.50938)"

The two elements are, literally, a fusing of the natural with the industrial world. Each bird stands with beak open, poised as if to announce the moment when the misty cool blue of night gives way to the pink glow of dawn. The scene evokes an abbreviated pastoral—but the birds are shackled to their perch, which is in turn connected to the hand crank. Upon closer inspection, however, an uneasy sensation of looming menace begins to manifest itself. Composed of a wiry, nervous line, these creatures bear a resemblance to birds only in their beaks and feathered silhouettes; they appear closer to deformations of nature. The hand crank conjures up the idea that this ""machine"" is a music box, where the birds function as bait to lure victims to the pit over which the machine hovers. We can imagine the fiendish cacophony made by the shrieking birds, their legs drawn thin and taut as they strain against the machine to which they are fused.Klee's art, with its extraordinary technical facility and expressive color, draws comparisons to caricature, children's art, and the automatic drawing technique of the Surrealists. In Twittering Machine, his affinity for the contrasting sensibilities of humor and monstrosity converges with formal elements to create a work as intriguing in its technical composition as it is in its multiplicity of meanings.","English-language films (0.948521), Albatross (0.613234), Hand (0.497154), Beak (0.495449), The Automatic (0.493381), Tippi Hedren (0.481279), Composition (0.48051), Composition (0.471572)"

It depicts five naked women with figures composed of flat, splintered planes and faces inspired by Iberian sculpture and African masks. The compressed space the figures inhabit appears to project forward in jagged shards; a fiercely pointed slice of melon in the still life of fruit at the bottom of the composition teeters on an impossibly upturned tabletop. These strategies would be significant in Picasso's subsequent development of Cubism, charted in this gallery with a selection of the increasingly fragmented compositions he created in this period. Picasso unveiled the monumental painting in his Paris studio after months of revision. The Avignon of the work's title is a reference to a street in Barcelona famed for its brothel. In Picasso's preparatory studies for the work, the figure at the left was a man, but the artist eliminated this anecdotal detail in the final painting.","Cubism (0.947523), Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (0.924415), Pablo Picasso (0.895218), Museum of Modern Art (0.679014), El Greco (0.562973), Sculpture (0.484161), Painting (0.481187), Composition (0.464892)"

Many artists used one of these slightly convex, dark-tinted mirrors to clarify their compositions; a scene reflected in it is less colorful than life, its compositional elements accentuated. Something close to that effect is visible here in the structured vertical and horizontal bands and the cool blue palette that Matisse painted over other layers of color, some of which are still visible.

The result was an unprecedented view of the future of urban travel in the new twentieth century.

All of them exhibit Eisenstein's self-conscious manipulation of the medium of film. One of the most memorable shots, comprising the Odessa steps sequence, for example, captures the horror of the massacre in a close-up of a woman screaming after she has been wounded by the advancing soldiers. His brilliantly percussive editing, detailed shots, repetitions, contrasts, compressions and expansions of time, and collisions of images ran counter to the trend toward a seamless illusion of reality found in other national cinemas of the 1920s. With this film, Soviet cinema took a central place on the world scene, in spite of the fact that the film was censored, even banned, in many countries for its powerful glorification of the Soviet ideal. After the Revolution, young film directors searched for a cinematic style that, by destroying tradition, would help to bring about a new society. In films on revolutionary subjects, they abandoned conventional structure, experimented with new techniques, and used montage. Eisenstein, in particular, believed that juxtapositions of images would shock viewers into becoming active cinematic agents.","Russian Empire (0.948939), The Battleship Potemkin (0.897898), Soviet Union (0.861119), Vladimir Lenin (0.83379), October Revolution (0.825681), Russia (0.822693), Saint Petersburg (0.79703), Film (0.714941)"

On a lark, he is shanghaied by a trio of young Americans onto a yacht headed for the U.S., only to discover that the captain is a jewel smuggler on his way to the American Southwest.

Its ambitious scale and lavish production—exemplified by the enormous, if historically inaccurate, set for the court of Babylon—were unprecedented at the time. The film was to serve as a mighty sermon against the hideous effects of intolerance; in it, Griffith proposed his view of history and myth. Intolerance interweaves his unfinished work, ""The Mother and the Law,""a contemporary melodrama about the hypocrisy of well-off do-gooders set in the United States, with three parallel stories of earlier times: Christ at Calvary, the razing of Babylon by Persians, and the persecution of the Huguenots in France. Griffith explained the film: ""The stories begin like four currents looked at from a hilltop. At first the four currents flow apart, slowly and quietly. But as they flow, they grow nearer and nearer together, and faster and faster, until in the end, in the last act, they mingle in one mighty river of expressed emotion.""The scale and extravagance of Intolerance brought Hollywood to the fore as the center for American film production. The film also exercised enormous international influence, particularly in post-Revolutionary Russia, where Lenin commended the scope and purpose of the film. But the complexity of the structure seemed to baffle early audiences, and Intolerance was a box-office failure, although Griffith's previous film, The Birth of a Nation (1915), had been a great success.","Film (0.949781), Movie theater (0.904855), Cinema of the United States (0.768619), Los Angeles (0.674758), Unfinished work (0.673172), Box office (0.672324), Hollywood, Los Angeles, California (0.642723), National Film Registry (0.612866)"

Perhaps the painting suggests both Walter's day-self and her night-self, both her tranquillity and her vitality, but also the transition from an innocent girl to a worldly woman aware of her own sexuality. It is also a complex variant on the traditional Vanity—the image of a woman confronting her mortality in a mirror, which reflects her as a death's head. On the right, the mirror reflection suggests a supernatural x-ray of the girl's soul, her future, her fate. Her face is darkened, her eyes are round and hollow, and her intensely feminine body is twisted and contorted. She seems older and more anxious.

As the First World War ended, however, a new age of ubiquitous technology truly began. Man Ray trained as a draftsman specializing in engineering and machinery and was therefore ideally qualified to picture the appearance of this new subject in terms specific to itself; in terms, at least, of its popular appeal. For while Vorticists like Lawrence Atkinson had already coopted the techniques of mechanical drawing to give to abstract subjects a cool, machinelike look, Man Ray used techniques developed for advertising tecnhnological products to give to the invented machine we see here the glamour that attached to machines themselves. This drawing was prepared by stencils and templates, over which an airbrush was used. Then carefully ruled lines, meticulous lettering, and areas of painstakingly filled-in gouache complemented what, in effect, is a presentation drawing for a manufactured object—but one whose function is irrational and obscure. Whereas the dynamism of the machine is the pricipal subject of pre–First World War technologically obsessed modernism, the function and then the appearance of the machine become more imporatant as artistic subjects from around the time of the war. This is partly to be attributed to the increasing familiarity of machines and to disenchantment with technological force produced by the war. While further from an actual machine than [Severini's Armored Train in Action (1915)], Man Ray's drawing looks more closely at the workings of machinery than that does; and it does so ironically. It also, however, makes the structure of the machine its own structure. Before this could happen there was required not merely a new attitude and knowledge of technology; also, a new perception of the function of subject matter in modern works of art.Once the subject and the object of modern art converged, as they did in collage—where representation of a still life was replaced, in effect, by making a still life—the work of art became an object more in the world than of it. A curious impasse was thus produced, for further to increase art's objecthood could only, it seemed, lead to works of art that were simultaneously subjects and objects—like ""real"" objects in the world. To follow this path would be to surrender most of the traditional reasons for making art at all. Hence Picasso's return to representation after the First World War. Marcel Duchamp, however, did carry the objecthood of modern art to its logical conclusion. His ""readymades"" are common manufactured objects, detached from their contexts, that function as art objects themselves, with subject and object as one. Manufactured objects were ideal for this purpose because they, like art objects, were artificially contrived. The machine, and things made by machines, thereby became paradigmatic of what art itself was in the world. In Man Ray's drawing, not subject and object but subject and structure are one. This also derives from Duchamp: from the so-called Large Glass that followed his first readymades, from which Man Ray also takes his sexual interpretation of the machine. The female ""Orchestrelle"" leans over invitingly to the beaming Cinematograph. ""Abandon of the Safety Valve"" trails through the air like one of those advertising slogans still to be seen pulled by turning aircraft, but a novelty then. And in a strip up the side of the drawing, even, passion begins rising, then reaches climax and crosses the edge of the sheet.","Modernism (0.962126), Object (0.855115), Dada (0.852394), Marcel Duchamp (0.844295), Art (0.775999), World War I (0.726417), Visual arts (0.619945), Work of art (0.613159)"

It is the wiring diagram of a Dada alarm clock (made in Switzerland in 1919) which historically plots the flow of the current of modern art, from Ingres to 391, Picabia's own Dada magazine. For the nonmechanically minded, some words of explanation as to how this machine works: To the left we see a battery in cross section, with the electircal current moving in waves between the positive and negative poles, properly represented: the former in black, the latter in white (and with the ladderlike pattern that conventionally associates the negative with neutral or ground). French modernism is attracted to the stable, negative pole (and therefore to tradition), and rises historically until it reaches (with the help of Walter Arensberg, patron to French artists in New York) the rectangular transformer that bears the Dada name. Around the top of the active, positive (and therefore antitraditional) pole is an international cluster of innovative early twentieth–century artists, headed (of course) by Picabia himself. This positive pole directly connects with the Dada clock. The negative pole of French modernism, however, has to pass through the Dada transformer before it can be wired up to that inner circle. (Even then the wiring job looks amateur and not entirely convincing, but apparently it works.) When thus connected, the circuit is completed; the clock can start ticking, and the bell that was made in Paris and New York can begin to sound.The drawing was made for the ""Anthologie Dada"" issue (May 1919) of the Zurich magazine Dada, edited by Tristan Tzara, where it was reproduced on pink paper by the printer Julius Heuberger, who was sent to prison for his anarchist activities during the preparation of the magazine. On its inside cover was reproduced a Picabia drawing called Réveil matin, made by dismembering an alarm clock and printing its parts in ink. After previously having mainly used automobiles as the source of his machine images, Picabia shifted (appropriately) to clocks when he moved to Switzerland; hence the form of this drawing too. Its subject is by no means unique. Indeed, charts like this became a favorite Dada pastime just after the war, and served three main functions: to assert the superiority of Dada among contemporary movements; to clarify the progenitors and sympathizers of Dada; and to establish hierarchies within Dada itself, as quarrels about priority and sympathizers of Dada; and to establish hierarchies within Dada itself, as quarrels about priority and importance developed once the movement became established. The first such chart, Picabia's Construction moléculaire, was published in the first Zurich issue (February 1919) of 391. It listed only New York and Paris Dadaists. This one, published three months later, affirms Picabia's alliance with the Zurich Dadists, listing as it does Dadaists from all three centers within the clock face.Obviously, then, this is an interpretation as well as a document of history, drawing as it does a highly selective diagram of the history of modern art: a history, in fact, not of modernism itself but rather of what the critic Frank Kermode calls neomodernism, the antitraditional and antiformalist branch of modernism, intimated by Futurism, that Dada properly began. The history recounted in this drawing justifies the kind of modernism that it itself pioneered.","Dada (0.989405), Tristan Tzara (0.766107), Francis Picabia (0.736658), Modernism (0.553036), Anti-art (0.529383), Marcel Duchamp (0.452087), Postmodern art (0.444782), Zrich (0.424631)"

It is also the last silent film of Lillian Gish, the mute art's greatest actress. In The Wind, natural forces destroy a delicate young woman, played by Gish, who is isolated in a desert cabin struck by sandstorms. Through both cinematography and Gish's performance, wind represents all the cosmic forces that have ever borne down on a vulnerable humanity. When faced with a brutal male attacker, Gish's seemingly fragile and innocent character summons a ferocious strength and resilience.What makes The Wind such an eloquent coda to its dying medium is Seastrom's and Gish's distillation of their art forms to the simplest, most elemental form: there are no frills. Seastrom was always at his best as a visual poet of natural forces impinging on human drama; in his films, natural forces convey drama and control human destiny. Gish, superficially fragile and innocent, could plumb the depths of her steely soul and find the will to prevail. The genius of both Seastrom and Gish comes to a climactic confluence in The Wind. Gish is Everywoman, subject to the most basic male brutality and yet freshly open to the possibility of romance. As a result, the film offers a quintessential cinematic moment of the rarest and most transcendentally pure art. Seastrom made nine films in the United States after accepting a 1923 offer from Hollywood, and although the silent film was on its way out, he left, in The Wind, one last enduring monument of the genre.","Lillian Gish (0.951113), Film (0.775258), Silent film (0.763674), The Birth of a Nation (0.634235), Way Down East (0.592638), Orphans of the Storm (0.571589), Mary Pickford (0.550454), The Wind (0.521341)"

Because his new style claimed supremacy over the forms of nature, he called it “Suprematism.” In a leaflet distributed at the exhibition, Malevich wrote, “I transformed myself in the zero of form, I destroyed the ring of the horizon and escaped from the circle of things, from the horizon-ring that confines the artist and forms of nature.” All of the works on this wall were included in this landmark show. Since Suprematism rejected the deliberate illusions of representational painting, Malevich saw it as a form of realism—""new painterly realism"" was his term—and understood its subject to be the basic components of painting's language, such as color, line, and brushwork. The basic units of this visual vocabulary were planes, stretched, rotated, and overlapping.

The poet Guillaume Apollinaire referred to the musicality implied in Delaunay's style when he deemed it ""Orphic Cubism"" or ""Orphism,"" a reference to the Greek god Orpheus, who tamed beasts with his mythical lyre playing. Between 1922 and 1928, Delaunay executed five lithographs based on earlier paintings. The prints, like the paintings, exemplify Delaunay's engagement with the dynamism of Paris, as embodied primarily in its architecture. Favoring monochromatic drawings and prints over the brilliant color for which he was best known, the artist relied instead on chiaroscuro effects in concert with rhythmically placed lines and patterns. Delaunay drew throughout his career with the liquid tusche and greasy black crayon commonly used for lithography, so the process of making prints was not a great departure for him. In all, he made approximately thirty-five lithographs, most of which were book illustrations. A Parisian publisher had planned to include The Eiffel Tower in a portfolio of lithographs by Delaunay, with a text by French novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans, but the project was never completed. As the world's tallest monument at the time, the Eiffel Tower was for Delaunay a symbol of both modernity and masculinity, and he depicted it time and again. He was among the first artists to focus on this landmark as a subject, and it appears throughout his illustrated book Allo! Paris, with text by Joseph Delteil.

Because his new style claimed supremacy over the forms of nature, he called it ""Suprematism.""

He was facing bankruptcy when Alan Crosland's The Jazz Singer, with long sequences of song and dialogue, took America by storm in 1927. Sensing that sound movies meant big business, Disney decided to stake all on his talking mouse. The movie opened at the Colony Theater in New York on November 18, 1928, a date that would become known as Mickey's birthday. Audiences were stunned by the vitality of the film's characters. Unhampered by the difficulties of using new equipment with live actors, Disney was able to fuse technology with handcraftsmanship, naturalism with abstraction, an ability that, over time, proved him to be a great artist. So strong was the audience demand for Steamboat Willie that two weeks after its premiere Disney re-released it at the largest theater in the world, the Roxy in New York City.

Though the trees and rocks firmly structure the scene, Cézanne also infused Pines and Rocks with a sense of airiness and movement. Glimpses of bare, unfinished canvas peek through the dense weave of brushstrokes. At first glance, Cézanne's palette seems limited to blues, greens, and browns, but a closer look reveals endless variations of colors, including shades of yellows, violets, and reds. At close range the painting appears nearly abstract—a dancing network of innumerable brushstrokes, some parallel, others looser and more rapidly applied.

The bather's left, forward leg is placed firmly on the ground, but his right leg trails and carries no weight. The right side of his body is pulled higher than the left, the chin curves lopsidedly, and the right arm is elongated and oblique. The landscape is as bare as a desert, but its green, violet, and rose coloration refuses that name. Its dreaming expanse matches the bather's pensiveness. Likewise, the shadows on the body, rather than shifting to black, share the colors of the air, land, and water; and the brushwork throughout is a network of hatch-marks and dapples, restless yet extraordinarily refined. The figure moves toward us but does not meet our gaze.These disturbances can be characterized as modern: they indicate that while Cézanne had an acute respect for much of traditional art, he did not represent the male nude the way the classical and Renaissance artists had done. He wanted to make an art that was ""solid and durable like the art of the museums"" but that also reflected a modern sensibility incorporating the new understanding of vision and light developed by the Impressionists.

Primarily a painter and draftsman, Cézanne was not a prolific printmaker. His complete output of prints consists of nine works in both etching and lithography. His first experiment with printmaking came in the summer and fall of 1873 when he was working in Auvers, surrounded by serious print enthusiasts: fellow artists Camille Pissarro and Armand Guillaumin; and Cézanne's host, the Impressionist patron and famed Vincent van Gogh subject, Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet. Under their influence and encouragement, Cézanne executed five etchings, but he discontinued printmaking after parting company with them. It would be twenty years before he made another print. In 1895 Parisian publisher and gallerist Ambroise Vollard gave Cézanne an exhibition that was instrumental in promoting his work and establishing his reputation. This show coincided with the revival of color lithography in France in the 1890s, and Vollard was among those art entrepreneurs who commissioned and published prints for portfolios. Cézanne created a lithograph for one of Vollard's early portfolios and two more for another, never-realized project. One of the latter was The Large Bathers, based on his best-known painting at the time and one of numerous works depicting this subject. To make the color lithograph, Cézanne painted in watercolor over a black-and-white proof of the composition, then entrusted master printer Auguste Clot to help him re-create the same color effects through lithography. This and other collaborative efforts between artist and printer were common print workshop practice.","Vincent van Gogh (0.984128), Printmaking (0.849933), Paul Gauguin (0.769375), Paul Czanne (0.72806), Impressionism (0.698974), Printing (0.664783), Lithography (0.633363), Intaglio (0.577489)"

For example, the edges of the fruit in the bowl are undefined and appear to shift.

Between about 1890 and 1908 he made approximately sixty prints—roughly half of them etchings and half lithographs—most of which were commissioned for books or albums. Pinning the Hat, one of Renoir's largest, most elaborate prints, is among the lithographs he published in the 1890s, when color lithography finally began to shed its commercial associations and became a vehicle for original expression. His efforts in this medium were greatly indebted to the enterprising encouragement of two men: the Parisian dealer Ambroise Vollard, who commissioned prints by contemporary artists, and eventually became the most important print publisher of his time; and Auguste Clot, the great lithography printer who printed many of Vollard's editions. Vollard believed that by using the finest paper and inks and employing the best master printers his editions would appeal to collectors as affordable alternatives to unique works. To create this print, Renoir made a preliminary drawing on paper, which was transferred to the lithographic stone. He then reworked the image on the stone, using lithographic ink. After this state was printed, he colored an impression with pastel, which the printer then used as a guide for the preparation of the color print. The final print bears the kind of loose, feathery markings and vivid, atmospheric coloring that are hallmarks of Renoir's paintings. The subject, which Renoir had previously treated in a pastel and an oil painting of 1893, as well as in three etchings of 1894, is the painter Berthe Morisot's daughter, Julie, pinning flowers on her cousin Paulette's broad-brimmed hat.","Printing (0.98767), Printmaking (0.707369), Pierre-Auguste Renoir (0.704784), History of painting (0.659994), Impressionism (0.659855), Lithography (0.633919), Berthe Morisot (0.574373), Printing press (0.500396)"

Her pose is solid and stable, her dress is the painting's largest unbroken form, and her face and hands stand out against browns and blacks, and against the extraordinary trapezoid of mottled color that describes the room's wallpaper. Her daughter, by contrast, almost disintegrates into this surface, as if its dots had temporarily organized themselves into the checkered pattern of her dress. Pressing herself awkwardly against the wall, she bends her head and shoulders, apparently greeting a visitor but also, it seems, forced to bow if she is to fit in the picture's frame.Intimate in scale, this scene is deceptively casual. Relying on imaginative insight as well as on the direct observation prized by the Impressionists, Vuillard constructs a psychologically suggestive space: the table, the bulky chest of drawers, the overactive wallpaper, and the steeply rising perspective of the floor make a crowded container for the figures, and the claustrophobia this suggests is heightened by slightly leaning angles, an imperfectly centered composition, and the daughter's off-balance posture. The whole space seems apt to fall inward at Mme. Vuillard—a dominating, even oppressive force in the room (and, we suspect, in the family); she is also the gravitational principle that prevents a collapse.","Family (0.92741), Force (0.850473), The Wall (0.755467), General relativity (0.677781), Impressionism (0.642536), The Extraordinary (0.641519), Composition (0.636385), Observation (0.625245)"

The tubular steel of his bicycle's handlebars was strong and lightweight, and lent itself to mass-production. Breuer reasoned that if it could be bent into handlebars, it could be bent into furniture forms.The model for this chair is the traditional overstuffed club chair; yet all that remains is its mere outline, an elegant composition traced in gleaming steel. The canvas seat, back, and arms seem to float in space. The body of the sitter does not touch the steel framework. Breuer spoke of the chair as ""my most extreme work . . . the least artistic, the most logical, the least 'cozy' and the most mechanical."" What he might have added is that it was also his most influential work. An earlier version of this chair was designed by Breuer in 1925, and within a year, designers everywhere were experimenting with tubular steel, which would take furniture into a radically new direction.

Perhaps more important to him, though, was his understanding with the president of Armour, Henry Heald, that he would be the architect of the school's master plan for a new campus-an unprecedented opportunity for him to design an assemblage of structures in an urban center. Mies undertook preliminary studies for the campus plan between 1939 and 1941. The studies reflect the urban street grid of Chicago; in this example, a dozen or so flat-roofed two- and three-story brick buildings are arranged so that they mirror each other across 33rd Street. While in Germany, Mies had served as the director of the Bauhaus school (from 1931 until its closing in 1933), and had taught architecture to senior students. At Armour, however—renamed the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) shortly after his arrival there—he taught not a master class but a curriculum patterned after the Bauhaus Vorkours, preliminary courses that taught essential skills to students before they advanced to designing initially simple structures. His relationship to his IIT students, then, and their relationship to his work, were significantly different, and he was able to direct their entire architectural education from draftsmanship to urban design. In fact many of the drawings Mies produced in America, including this one, display a mixture of hands: students who had mastered his drafting style (and many of whom would eventually work in his office) would develop the base drawing to his specifications, and he would then add texture, shadow, trees, and other landscape elements to make the drawing complete. When Mies began the master plan for IIT, the college was still known as the Armour Institue of Technology.

The democratically elected postwar government had made its aspirations for the pavilion clear: the building was to represent ""our desire to be absolutely truthful, giving voice to the spirit of a new era."" The state made few other demands, leaving Mies free to pursue his most radical architectural expression of free-flowing space, bounded only by rich but abstract surfaces of Tinian marble, mirror chrome, plate glass, and onyx. Since the pavilion was demolished when the fair was over, relatively few later audiences and architectural critics had ever seen the building except through the filter of period black-and-white photographs, and its significance became largely a matter of thirdhand debate rather than actual experience. In time it came to be interpreted in terms of Mies's later, more rational work of the 1940s and later, often derided as simple ""glass boxes"".  This unfinished and little-published rendering of the interior, however, reveals another attitude, more sensual than objective. To the right of the column whose outlines are sketched in the center of the drawing, Mies carefully renders the view from the main space through a glass wall into the courtyard, with its reflecting pool and a sculpture of a reclining figure. Rather than making the glass look fully transparent, he gives the dark green Tinian marble different shadings behind the wall and to the left and right of it, approximating the visual effect of the screen of gray glass. Even the reflection of the sculpture in the pool is studiously considered.","Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (0.968177), Glass (0.552492), World War II (0.499629), Sculpture (0.434975), Left-wing politics (0.412939), Germany (0.404652), Mirror (0.39491), Barcelona Pavilion (0.367602)"

Cedric Price explored a type of architecture that, like medicine, would operate less as a remedy for the ills of society and more as a preventive system, creating flexible conditions previously thought impossible within a socially beneficial environment. This complicated project, for which many drawings and diagrams were made, was essentially a system of cubelike elements that could be moved and combined with others or with additional elements to create temporary structures for a rehearsal or performance space, housing, or just contemplation within a lush natural setting. It was intended to operate by means of a central computer with which a visitor would combine any of 150 of the Generator's four-by-four meter, fully serviced, air-conditioned cubes, or walls, screens, gangways, and communications channels into a structure. The computer would encourage the visitor to continually refine and improve his or her design. In fact, change and artistic freedom are the underlying ideas of the Generator; they were considered prerequisites, and the computer was to be programmed to make unsolicited alterations should the framework remain static.

Inspired by Francisco de Goya's series of etchings The Disasters of War (1810 – 20) and Samuel Beckett's play Waiting for Godot (1952), the landscape evokes a moral vacuum brought on by the horrors of war.Projected on both sides of a suspended screen, the seven-scene allegory features the digital likenesses of filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini and rapper Biggie Smalls, who act as stand-ins for Beckett's existential bums. The cast also includes a few paparazzi (who are naked except for cameras and flashbulbs), suicide bombers geared up for Armageddon, and an assembly of twenty predatory birds based on descriptions from the Book of Leviticus in the Bible. The narrative unfolds against a soundtrack of ringing cellphones and car alarms that evokes the dissonant timbre of a cataclysm.In some scenes black smoke rising in the east harks back to burning oil fields in the Middle East, and in others gruesome hangings rendered in acidic colors provoke uneasy associations with mistreated detainees at Abu Ghraib prison.

He centers our attention—like that of the excited fans with their exploding flashbulbs—on the gravity–defying basketball as it mysteriously, even miraculously, floats in midair.Pfeiffer confounds the ideal of Renaissance one–point perspective by guiding our attention toward the margins of the frame: our eyes never rest as the ball is tossed this way and that. Also, he intensifies the perceptual experience by reducing the scale of the looped image. By presenting it on a miniature LCD monitor easily seen by only one viewer at a time, he transforms a dramatic public sporting event into a moment of private, almost devotional, contemplation. ""The ideal of painting is when you can forget your body and have a visual experience that is really pure,"" Pfeiffer has observed, ""[but] in sports, you cannot disembody your eye, because it is a matter of coordinating your body and your eye and your mind.""

While many of his works draw from autobiographical experiences, with images of family members and events from his daily life, others are limited in scope and draw from the properties of filmmaking itself. In the 1970s Brakhage and other filmmakers, such as James Herbert and Andrew Noren, intensified their explorations of cinema's formal properties. The richest areas of investigation were two of film's basic means of expression: the apparent motility of light and the resultant texture of the transient image. Brakhage's Text of Light is the purest of the astonishing works made by these filmmakers. The spare but vital subject of the film is light, and nothing but light.

Her work as a designer of exhibitions, of clothing and furniture, and of buildings in the Germany of the 1920s and '30s adhered to this essential criterion. Her most important role was unequivocably as an exhibition designer: for over twenty-five years, her distinctive installations allowed the materials and the content of the display to act as its primary determining features. Reich had no formal training in design or architecture, but she learned dressmaking and various craft techniques early on, and her talent in these areas was soon recognized by a circle of women in the avant-garde design field. By 1911 Reich had earned commissions for a department store display and for the interior design and furnishings of a youth center. The event that made this career a life-long pursuit came in 1912, when she joined the Deutsche Werkbund, an organization that promoted German design through exhibitions and educational programs. Her commitment to and distinguished work for the Werkbund were deservedly rewarded in 1920, when she became the first woman elected to the board of directors. In 1927 Reich began a collaboration with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe that would last until the late 1930s. She always retained her own professional office, even when working with Mies on such large-scale and consequential projects as The Dwelling in Our Time. Reich participated in this exhibition as both designer and architect, and she was responsible for five full-scale installations: two apartments, a single-family house, and exhibits of exterior and interior finishing materials and furnishings. The precise and austere drawings shown on these pages, each stamped ""Atelier L. Reich"", show the plan and elevation for a textile exhibit and a technical detail of a rack for a display of wallpapers. Clearly representing Reich's working process, the drawings are a construction tool rather than an end in themselves. The plan and elevation drawing for the textile exhibit also reveals the graceful, free-flowing spaces that Reich could create using only the materials of the exhibit themselves as partitions between the different sections of the display. The fabrics on show seem to hold themselves up, with few visible signs of underlying support. This minimalist aesthetic discloses Reich's unwavering and enduring commitment to modernist principles of function and simplicity.","Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (0.983402), Exhibition (0.470444), Bauhaus (0.428619), Exhibitions (0.404954), 1930s (0.360346), Barcelona chair (0.355411), Germany (0.35284), 1920s (0.318495)"

The only film made directly by the artist Fernand Léger, it demonstrates his concern during this period—shared with many other artists of the 1920s—with the mechanical world. In Léger's vision, however, this mechanical universe has a very human face. The objects photographed by Dudley Murphy, an American photographer and filmmaker, are transformed by the camera and by the editing rhythms and juxtapositions. In Ballet méchanique, repetition, movement, and multiple imagery combine to animate and give an aesthetic raison d'être to the clockwork structure of everyday life. The visual pleasures of kitchenware—wire whisks and funnels, copper pots and lids, tinned and fluted baking pans—are combined with images of a woman carrying a heavy sack on her shoulder, condemned like Sisyphus (but through a cinematic sense of wit) to climb and reclimb a steep flight of stairs on a Paris street. The dynamic qualities of film and its capacity to express the themes of a kinetic 20th-century reach a significant level of accomplishement in this early masterpiece of modern art.","Art (0.936278), Photography (0.923107), Camera (0.719936), Film (0.686038), Modern art (0.609806), Film director (0.597732), Fernand Lger (0.583404), Modern history (0.568385)"

Key figures of the contemporary Parisian art world appear in the film in absurd comic cameos, including Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp, Jean Borlin (director of the Ballets Suédois), Georges Auric, Picabia, and Clair himself.

In Le Retour à la raison (Return to Reason), the artist extended the rayograph technique to moving images—he sprinkled salt and pepper onto one piece of film and pins onto another and added sequences of night shots at a fairground and a segment showing a paper mobile dancing with its own shadow.

In the resulting photomontage, the monument appears wedged into the hillside; its neoclassical colonnade and massive podium, overgrown with foliage, suggest that the buildings existence is not hypothetical, but rather fact.
