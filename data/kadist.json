One boy is shot to death inside a pick-up truck, two endure a brick-carrying competition, and another digs his grave, and so on, making the project a kind of education of masculinity, but also the forced corruption their family has endured under the violent pursuit of power. Yet understood from the broader context of Mexico, under the disaster of its national economy, the artistic use of the reenactment process is as much about the individual and the ability of Aragon's youngest family members to avoid such corruption again in the future, as it is about a collective social condition of survival and endurance.",

Woodshop, table, man, and floor are lacquered together, spilling into one another and freezing the protagonist vulnerably in place.",

As his steel outline gleefully makes off with a bag of money and a stack of bills, another icon of affluent America, Uncle Pennybags (otherwise known as the Monopoly Man), is crushed underfoot between two heavy blocks. Behind them lies a broken piggy bank, depicted upside down with eyes x-ed out. The scene represents the collision of two fictional worlds--both geared toward children--in which being well moneyed is an assumptive aspiration. With the free market unleashed, these two nostalgic, seemingly innocuous figures are made to compete against one another, and the very competition begins to read as sinister.",

His photographs, drawings and installations are often evocative yet betray a certain sublime component. In Jacobsen’s work one can spot an influence from the first generation of Mission School artists, active in the Bay Area since the 90s. This influence manifests itself through Jacobsen’s predilection for using materials bought in thrift stores, lost personal items found in the urban environment, or recycled packaging with unusual details in order to create many of his installations and assemblages. Local writer Kevin Killian once pointed that many of Jacobsen’s works reveal the use of a very sophisticated gay semiotics.",

Stacked in the shape of a cube and available for visitors to take, Gonzalez-Torres’s passports did not offer citizenship, but instead invited participation in a sense of borderless being. Jacobsen’s piece, Untitled (Untitled Passport II) is a diptych depicting two page spreads from Gonzalez- Torres’s booklet. The perfect graphite renderings freeze the book with its pages splayed, wings perpetually open. But the boundless generosity of Gonzalez-Torres’s piece finds a limit in Jacobsen’s unique (copied) original; these images are behind glass, their meanings visibly internalized by the artist, whose notes appear in pencil around the edges.",

In the framework of this exhibition, Meiro Koizumi decided to use a controversial book of modern Japanese history The Judgement of Justice Radhabinod Pal, as material for his work. Koizumi created a performance combining the paradoxical context of this book with monstrous representation of Indian gods. The central performer had to read the Judgement of Pal as seriously as possible, while two other performers on the side had to make a comedy out of the situation. It is Koizumi's attempt to create a new god-like mythical figure that embodies the contradiction inscribed within modern Japanese history and identity. The context of this work has much to do with the trial held in Tokyo right after the war to judge Japanese war criminals. Judge Pal was the only Asian judge to be invited to the trial, and he was the only one that found all the defendants not guilty.",

    "artist_name": "Eric Baudelaire", 
    "description": "In a society saturated by images, Eric Baudelaire is interested in political events that have not found their representation. For the film The Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao Adachi and 27 Years without Images, Baudelaire conducted research on 1970s Japanese cinema and more specifically on Wakamatsu and Masao Adachi's filmography. In 1971, as the two legendary filmmakers of Japanese Nouvelle Vague were on their way home from a presentation at the Cannes festival, they stopped in Beirut, where their thinking concerning the image took the form of political activism. They made a documentary on the Palestinian struggle. Three years later, Masao Adachi became the writer for the Japanese Red Army Faction, which was linked to the PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine). In this film, the 30 year-long journey of the Japanese Red Army is told by two of its protagonists. As the daughter of the founder of the group, May Shigenobu was a close witness. She was born in hiding in Lebanon and only experienced being in Japan from the age of 27, after the arrest of her mother. Adachi was the theorist of fûkeiron, the movement of filmmakers who shot landscape in order to reveal the omnipresent structures of power. There are no images of his 27 years of voluntary exile since what he filmed in Lebanon was destroyed during the war on three occasions. Therefore The Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao Adachi and 27 Years without Images is structured through speech, witness accounts and memory (or false memories). The stories are intertwined and reveal complex rapports between militancy, terrorism and cinema.Thus one wonders whether, once Adachi sided with the armed struggle, he might have continued to think like a director, planning the airplane highjacking or hostage-taking as scripts where actors would be the militants and where television cameras replaced those of the filmmaker. More broadly, this film considers the role of art and the powerlessness that could lead to the shift from an artistic practice to armed struggle. It follows the shift from a cinematographic image to that of propaganda, and armed propaganda, before concentrating on the reconstruction of missing images.",

    "description": "Since 2005, Charles Avery has devoted his practice to the perpetual description of a fictional island. Replete with its own population and constantly shifting topography, Avery’s intricately conceived project amounts to an ever-expanding body of drawings, sculptures, installations and texts which evince the island. Exhibited incrementally these heterogeneous elements serve as terms within the unifying structure of the island – as multiple emissions of an imaginary state, and as a meditation on the central themes of philosophy and the problems of art-making. The ultimate destination of Avery’s epic venture is the documentation of this ‘heterotopia’ in a book of many volumes. Avery is one of a number of artists who have promoted a return to narrative. The Kadist Foundation Collection also owns a fictive map by Avery.This drawing is a medium-sized work in which Avery depicts an event taking place on the island close to the Labour Exchange down by the port. In essence he depicts a dance-off between waiters and itinerant workers who are looking for work on the island. The idea comes from his own experience as a 16 year-old in Italy where he met a Spaniard who had danced his way from Spain to Italy, earning money in the street by doing so. Avery teamed up with him and became the hat carrier, money collector. Avery sees this kind of drawing as a companion to the large architectural views that show the principal buildings on the island and distant views of people. It is as though he is zooming in on a particular incident caught at the edge of a camera lens. The island is of course fictional but it is nevertheless a credible place, a little like Second Life, where characters act out their lives. In fact people are beginning to use the scenarios in their teaching work as though they were real and exemplary of certain true life situations. If there is a fantastical element at all it is redolent of Jabberwocky, Lewis Carroll’s celebrated poem, which has been an important text for Avery. Avery is creating a world which could well be a place on this planet, an island off the coast of his native Scotland, for example, which can be visited by tourists (essentially the role of the viewer) or by those who want to stay there indefinitely (the role of the characters in the drawings).",

    "description": "LaToya Ruby Frazier is an artist and a militant; her photos combine intimate views of her relation with her parents and grandparents with the history of the Afro-American community of Braddock, Pennsylvania, where she grew up and where her family still live.She reports upon the decline of this steel-producing town, which was once prosperous and where the local population today is devastated by poverty, unemployment and health problems linked to pollution. The town has currently closed the hospital which increases unemployment and makes access to treatment complicated for the residents of one of the most polluted towns in the USA.Through this documentary work with ties to the intimate, she goes beyond the basic information to touch upon the human consequences of these tragedies.Frazier's images are embedded in the history of the United States of America and they highlight what is unspoken in the social landscape. Her work is focused on the tragedy of Braddock, a town hit by a slow decay and increasing poverty (steel factories closing, crack epidemic, community debacle, disappearance of shops and urban equipment).The captioned photographs of protests and advertising are printed with a textured effect, burnt-looking, recalling the “Rusty Belt” nickname for the steel factories of this region.The portfolio reports on a new wave of devastation, that of a workers' culture in the process of disappearing.In 2009, the Levi’s brand chose the town as the backdrop of its new advertising campaign, focusing on the figure of the “new pioneer”.Frazier mixes photographs of this campaign with others of the town and its protests against the closure and destruction of the hospital in a form of critique of the utilization of this town and its population by Levi’s.The juxtaposition of these images documents and denounces the violent and jarring economic ambiguity of the commercial dynamic that feeds off a tragedy and a decrepit context. The proceeds of the sale of these artworks will go to the activist groups fighting for the reconstruction of the hospital.",

    "artist_name": "Goshka Macuga", 
    "description": "Goshka Macuga is a Polish artist living in London. She works with archival materials she finds in libraries and museums. Her work often begins with the history of the sites in which she is working, researching the collections of the institutions she works with, the work of artists she is interested in. Sometimes she recreates works by other artists, blurring the boundaries between artist and curator. For example at the Kunsthalle Basel, she recreated a 1971 exhibition of sculptures by Robert Morris that took place at the Tate Gallery in London which was closed by Tate authorities after 4 days as a result of safety scares. Macuga’s recreation allowed the public to experience the danger as well as the avant-garde nature of that exhibition. Her Basel show also engaged with issues relating to Neocolonialism, the arms race and US militancy, bringing together photographs taken by Aby Warburg during his exploration of the Hopi tribe in Arizona in the mid 19th century, a video of her own journey on the footsteps of Warburg and snapshots taken by a Vietnam war veteran that Makuga acquired on the Internet. She juxtaposed these with images of contemporary events relating to Afghanistan and Iraq and the economic crisis. More recently she brought a tapestry of Guernica that normally hangs at the United Nations in New York, to the Whitechapel Gallery in London and used it as a backdrop for public meetings. At documenta in Kassel, she exhibited a tapestry that brought together photographic images of the artists in documenta and a view of people in Kabul. Macuga’s work is engaged with political issues of her times.In this anti-collage, which comes from a series of 4, Macuga takes a photo she found in the archives of Zacheta National Gallery in Warsaw. The series was made on the occasion of her exhibition there in 2011. In 2000, Harald Szeemann curated an exhibition at Zacheta called 'Beware of Exiting your Dreams: You May Find Yourself in Somebody Else’s.’ The exhibition provoked a violent response as a result of his inclusion of Maurizio Cattelan’s La nona ora, where the figure of the Pope is struck down by a meteor. The work was vandalized by an MP; Anda Rottenberg, the director of the museum received a stream of abusive letters, many of them anti-semitic. Rottenberg organized a series of shows that were regarded by right wing Poles as scandalous and eventually she was forced to leave her post in 2001. In Anti-Collage, Rottenberg, depicted at a ceremony celebrating the centenary of Zacheta at the Presidential Palace, has been silhouetted out of the image. The void represents not only a dark period of Polish cultural history but also reflects upon the way in which history is rewritten in fascistic societies, particularly in former Soviet-style countries where inconvenient memories are erased. Ironically of course she stands between two Polish flags. After destroying Cattelan's work, the MP, Witold Tomczak, wrote to the Prime Minister not only demanding Rottenberg’s dismissal but also suggesting she should curate in Israel rather than in Poland. Macuga’s image is a timely reminder of cultural vandalism and censorship as well anti-semitism in Poland, alongside the work of Yael Bartana.",

By introducing simple signs or gestures – the construction of a concrete slab, displacement of a portion of bitumen on the side of the road, encroachement of grass on a parking, the three artists interrogate public space as the place of possibilities. Their interventions give users an active status with the power to decide on their own environment. For the Hong Kong architecture biennale, the collective intervened in the exhibition spaces. The intervention consisted in constructing a wall which integrated the word 'Anarchitecture' (anarchy + architecture) by omitting certain bricks. Therefore it was as if the word had perforated the wall. Through the wall, the spectator could see the city and its transformations. Thus the spectator was invited to develop his critical outlook on the environment.The collective - formed in 1998 - is composed by Julio Castro, born in 1976, Gabriel Cazares, born in 1978, and Rolando Flores, born in 1975.

Yet Koller is not only a seminal figure in the history of the neo- and post-avant-garde; his work has long been a critical inspiration for artists and intellectuals. In the most recent past, Koller's concepts of the Anti-Happening, the Anti-Picture, the Universal-cultural Futurological Operation (U.F.O.), his actions, objects, texts and the enormous referential archive he built up, have attracted growing interest on the part of a broader art public.  From around 1960, in response to the modernist mainstream in Slovak art, Julius Koller began to develop his aesthetic position of the “antihappening.” His strategy consists in using real objects and everyday life as the predefined program for an aesthetic operation: from 1965, in texts rubberstamped on paper that refer to the context of the “anti-happening,” and then in 1967/1968 in pictures for which Koller used white latex paint instead of oils and which saw the first appearance of the question mark—the symbol of Koller’s brands of naming, or “making known,” that was later to undergo many mutations in various media and states of aggregation. The “invitation cards for an idea”—as Koller called the text works relating to the “anti-happenings”—and the palimpsests and serial arrangements of the “anti-pictures” set themselves apart from the academicism of Modernism in more than just formal terms.

When a company goes out of business or moves, their sign often lingers and slowly fades creating a ghosted image of their sojourn.

Against a bare white background, the men appear unexpectedly vulnerable, caught between performance and rehearsal, public and private.

Just as meaning can be drained from a word through relentless repetition, Gaines’s thorough application of an invented representational system undermines the thing-ness of the simplest thing.

The folded guns suggest that United States currency carries with it an implicit violence. Though ordinarily barely audible, Capistran’s lucid permutations make that violence loud and clear. From a Whisper to a Scream is also the title of a 1987 horror film (also called The Offspring), in which a historian describes a series of gruesome murders that take place in a small town, the seeming center of an incomprehensibly evil force. In this case, the treacherous power is shown to be ubiquitous—the foundation of an economy that permeates everything and leaves no one untouched.",

With this work, Wood and Harrison create an intimate, formally structured mise-en-scène in which they use their own bodies in interaction with a wooden board. The artists elaborate an orchestration of  the comic consequences of inertia, gravity, and the law of falling bodies in this low-tech physics experiment. Their mix of Conceptual art and slapstick conveys a sense of inspired pranksterism. Board (1993)  is one of the very first works they made in collaboration.",

    "description": "Eight opens with a close up of a painting by Hubert Robert of the Chateau de Chamarande where the film was shot. This work  acts as a key to the unfolding film. In Eight, the camera tracks back and forth, proceeding from room to room, closing in on each motif, lingering and then passing on without ‘comment’, as a surrogate for the spectator’s gaze. Each tableau vivant that the camera/viewer encounters recalls some other cultural manifestation: Greek theatre in the mask, Magritte perhaps in the woman with no face, Caspar David Friedrich in the woman gazing out of the window, Greuze in the death scene observed by spectators (but also perhaps 19 century medical demonstrations to students) etc. Many of these motifs recur in von Brandenburg’s work so there is also a sense of self-reference. The film enshrines ambiguity; are these people alive or dead, animate or inanimate wax works? Only the paper that inflates and deflates indicates a living presence. This is the only motif that engages with the cinematic. Everything else is photographic and theatrical. Just as the film is destined to loop eternally (evoked by the moebius strip) so the figures seem to be frozen forever in their poses. However, part of the disquiet occurs in the gap between what we know and what we don’t know. Once the camera has passed do the figures come to life? Before the camera reaches them are they animate? The spectator is caught between worlds, between the conscious and the unconscious, the knowing and not knowing, in a timeless world staged for his inspection.",

In his work, he explores themes ranging from identity, authorship, sexuality, and ownership to origin. He uses intimate, personal material to show that identity is a construction of projections, assumptions and attributed values. Vo embarks upon a subtle investigation of the Western fascination for the exotic and unknown with an exquisite conceptual style. For Vo, appropriating the history of others is a way of unraveling monolithic ideas about identity. And he does so with great verve, generally initiating the journey with himself. In addition to his classifiable works, a certain mystified aura lingers around his actions: the artist has married, and subsequently divorced numerous people simply to add their names to his list, he has committed “crimes” later displaying their documentation as show, for example. In his installations he uses objects, photos and documentation that connects his family history to real memories intertwined with a complex imaginary. His refugee status has led him to attempt to reconstruct various derivations of identities, origins, and stories. This requires the questioning of social structures, the endorsement of different identities, the questioning of values, and the undermining of conventions in order set forth a groundwork for his personal depiction in the world of society at large.

    "description": "Good life (2007) is an installation displaying letters, documents, photographs and objects from a man named Joseph Carrier, and appropriated by artist Danh Vo.  The installation features a series of small square vitrines, inset, dark and precisely spot-lit. Inside these are framed photographs, mostly black and white, of young Asian men, taken, as the titles on the neat brass name plates tell us, in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s. In one vitrine, an old-fashioned camera sits propped up on its worn leather case. In another is a typewritten document titled ‘Beliefs, Attitudes and Behaviour of the Lowland Vietnamese’ and a crumpled business card, belonging to one ‘Joseph M. Carrier, National Academy of Sciences’. Presumably Carrier was the owner of the camera, an American in Vietnam during the war on an anthropological rather than a combat mission. We learn while viewing the installation, in the form of letters and correspondence that Carrier and Vo met during a personal exhibition of Vo’s at the Villa Aurora. The fruits of that meeting led Vo to create this archive on Carrier’s subjective experience in the 1960’s and 1970’s, all derived from Carrier’s personal possessions. This work is exemplary for its consideration of the archive and Vo’s incessant attempt to shed light on subdued homosexuality in Vietnam, appropriation, and surrogate biographies.",

    "artist_description": "Tarrop & Galbel is a  group of artists working together since 1993 and whose main objective see to challenge the more prevalent social values. Religion, trade in all its forms, the society of easy entertainment and empty spectacle (from sports to theme parks), military orders or media, nothing escapes the furious cynics who work in order to  seem to work for “fool” anything that alienates man and his conscience.Taroops & Glabel’s work is somewhat in keeping with their spirit: working surreptitiously, changing just one word, one comma, one small detail to alter everything. Essentially, their work consists of impeccably produced panels, graphic pages, humorist comic drawings, as well as installations, such as large-scale adhesive plastic letters and drawings. In one piece, the name Jesus Christ is laid out in beautiful black capital letters on a lustrous bronze ground followed by one small clinching detail – a circled R, the symbol for registered, transforming the piece into a sign for a vulgar commercial brand. Such is the impression one gets from Taroop & Glabel: certitudes are shattered, yesterday’s comforting words, maliciously singled-out and laid bare, become ridiculous but no more than the mottos we use today and to which we grant so much importance. Their name is a play on words or rather a lighthearted allusion to the “third eye,” only expressed in French, but then again without certitude. They live and work in Paris and Laffaux.",

They don't place themselves in opposition, but they unpick the political, economic and communication strategies that have been put in place in a context in order to make them more visible. SUPERFLEX intervene in places where it appears necessary to implement a “counter-economic” solution by experimenting with means of alternative production. They conceive their project in response to a context, whether it is that of an artistic institution or a social situation and create works that often establish a link between these two realities. The Danish collective was founded in 1993 by Bjørnstjerne Reuter Christiansen (1969), Jakob Fenger (1968) and Rasmus Nielsen (1969).", 
    "artist_name": "Superflex", 
    "description": "SUPERFLEX makes a distinction between two types of projects wit different temporalities: works that occur during an exhibition and other that evolved over several years. Thus, since 1997, they are working on a biogas system (SUPERGAS), first installed in Kenya, then Thailand and today in Mexico, perfecting at each stage the means of production, utilization and commercialization of this system. GUARANA POWER is one of these sustainable projects that create a real economy. The story begins in 2003 when SUPERFLEX was invited to Maués by a foundation and the government of the Brazilian state of Amazonas; this led to a collaboration with a cooperative of Guarana farmers. Maués is famous for its Opera shown in the film Fitzcarraldo but also as an industrial area situated in a free zone and housing multinationals such as Toshiba, Samsung or Benetton. During a first workshop with the Guarana farmers, they started discussing how to find common solutions to cultivate and commercialize Guarana without bending to the demands of the multinationals (like Antartica) who exploit the fruit and constantly reduce production costs and therefore labour costs. Thus the farmers' experience and the concepts introduced by SUPERFLEX lead to the set up of efficient strategies of communication which are regularly perfected to sell the Guarana Power bottles internationally. Right from the beginning of the project, Superflex decided to self-censure itself by using a barred logo following threat by the main multinational. The artwork was also censured by the director of the Sao Paulo Biennale in 2006, which provoked important reporting in the press at the time. More generally, this project poses the question of the role of art and its limitations with regards producing effective consequences in response to a socio-political situation.",

His work has been exhibited at the Venice Biennale, the Berlin Biennale, the Manifesta 3 in Ljubljana and in numerous solo and group exhibitions. He combines techniques from two realms of art, the moving image and painting. His captivating visual projects on the one hand constitute a penetrating analysis of culture and the human condition as determined by place and political context, and on the other an exploration of the language of imagery, codes of visual communication and structures of film narration. Many of his projects relate to the identity of individuals who function at the fringes of multiple cultures.Anri Sala was born in 1974 in Tirana, Albania. He lives and works in Berlin.",

Like in Blindfold (2002), in which a sunrise is reflected in urban billboards, and Time After Time (2001), in which the figure of a horse emerges from darkness lit by the headlights of an automobile, Sala likes to explore the phenomenon of light and its effects; In Ghost Games, he uses the threatening reflection of the flash light through the darkness of the beach. But unlike several of Sala’s videos’ deliberately slow style, where sometimes the camera does not even move at all, this film is punctuated by the erratic moves of the monster-like creature , its ghostly disappearances into sand holes; the crab’s occasional encounters with the feet of unidentified people standing in the sand, at times like an aggressive dance of protagonists, dramatically adds to the creepy feeling of the scene.",

    "artist_description": "Pablo Pijnappel's work is foremost highly constructed. He builds narrations based on anecdotes and everyday events, perhaps souvenirs, family legends or plain fictions. The non-linear use of different archives and film extracts highlights this uncertainty and contributes to the loss of these stories over time. The works only offer pauses and silent moments, allowing the investment of our imagination. The 'life stories' told by Pablo Pijnappel are often those of his family who travelled a lot and had to adapt to new countries and their cultures. Through his tales, we visit Brazil in the 1940s, Japan, the United Kingdom and also Germany.Pablo Pijnappel was born in 1979 in Paris, and he lives and works in Amsterdam.",

    "description": "In Felicitas, we follow the converging routes of three characters: Felicitas, Michael and Andrew (the artist's father-in-law who also features elsewhere). Felicitas is thedaughter of a German industrialist who immigrated to Rio after the Second World War. She is the one visible with a toucan in several images. In his work, Pablo Pijnappel privileges pre-existing images – the slides presented here are photographs found in his family archives or from other sources (media, photographs of film sets…). Sometimes, the same image is used several times with a different caption, thus encapsulating other meanings. Presented in the form of an installation with three synchronized slide projectors, Felicitas offers a complex scenario, where text and images can simultaneously be descriptive, intermingled or completely autonomous. Disjunctions and repetitions create the pace: the captioned images appear one after the other, with no regular order, sometimes on the left, in the centre or on the right. Even though the story follows a certain chronology, it is not linear and looks more like a complex collage of images and anecdotes which overlap. The text does not illustrate the images but functions as a complement that allows for the creation of multiple readings of the characters, of their lives, their trips and encounters. These collages are a mixture of real and fictional stories that enable Pijnappel to play with the notion of the documentary. The subtitles are in an informative tone, but they are mostly subjective and imagined commentaries thus creating what can be called a documentary fiction. This artwork has cinematographic qualities while deconstructing those conventions. Chris Marker's film La jetée in which the relation between voice-over and still images creates a space for free interpretation was a likely direct influence.",

He is considered the founder of “evolutionary economics.” One of his most well-known economic terms is “creative destruction,” which states that entrepreneurs with new ideas must destroy business models and practices that came before them in order to stimulate economic change. Many of Morris’ earlier drawings are dedicated to technology companies that no longer exist, having been incorporated into larger organizations or made obsolete by changes in the market, exemplifying Schumpeter’s process.

    "description": "The Mohawk, the emblematic Frontier river in the period of American colonisation, is here a cable of data transmission, and the 7 Sultans Casino is a virtual destination, one of the three hundred online casinos hosted by the servers located in Kahnawake, a small native american indian reserve to the south of Montreal. Incorporating poker, challenges to the law, a struggle for the control of a new territory where the stakes are high, our film 'The New Kahnawake', between fiction and documentary, pushes these analogies with the Western to explore both our relationship to the figure of the 'Indian' and the confusion of our perception of space that new information technology has brought about. As the artists state: \"We are neither anthropologists nor journalists. We didn't want to make a documentary on the Mohawks; we'll leave that to the Mohawks themselves who haven't waited for us to develop operational systems for their cinematic and audiovisual productions. Describing our last film, Manmuswak, we say that it is at once a fiction about the life of 'invisible' immigrants and a documentary about our way of perceiving them: this is the viewpoint that we would like to keep in this new film. If this is a documentary then the subject is us. We are documenting ourselves, in an 'extrospective' rather than introspective way. We are a multitude of things: a man and a woman, a heterosexual couple, the mother and the father of a little girl; we are the descendants of the working class and of the bourgeoisie, of white colonialists and black slaves, we are consumers, creators of cultural wealth, polluters, militants, internet users; we are French, we are European, we are westerners... So, in some respects we are similar to those who appear in the film, to the Mohawks, to the Quebecois, and to the gamblers, and we differ in others. Our film is a way of posing ourselves certain questions. In what way does this story interest us? That is, in what way does it involve us and concern us? In what way can it inform us? That is to say, teach us about ourselves and our place in the world process of globalisation.\"",

    "artist_description": "A number of Daria Martin's films explore the relationship between humans and machines and make reference to modernist art, whether through the work of the Bauhuas (Schlemmer), Surrealism (Giacometti's Palace at 4 AM) or American art of the 1960s and 1970s. Her films involve performance and many are shown as 16mm projections – assembling memories, reveries, scholarly research, and imported citations drawn from a wide range of sources including early twentieth century painting, sculpture, fashion, stage, and dance productions. “I came to the medium of film because of its open potential,” writes Daria Martin, “Its invitation to travel through time and space within an imagined world.” The artist values the contradictions of the medium of film, in particular the tension between the private fantasy it stimulates and the public physicality on which it depends.Daria Martin was born in 1973 in San Francisco. She lives and works in London.",

    "description": "Soft Materials is a curious, touching but also disturbing sequence of confrontations between two people: a man and a woman, and machines. Shot in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Zurich, the humans and the machines mirror each other's actions. It is unclear which party takes the lead. Do the humans mimic the machines or are the machines following the humans? Each of the protagonists, whether human or mechanical, are vulnerable and naked –the humans stripped of clothing and the machines lacking protective covering. Like the celebrated film \"Ballet Mechanique\" by Leger, Martin's film suggests the erotics of the mechanised world. The film evokes a history of modernist aspiration for utopia where man and machine would become bedfellows or at least entirely complimentary. The machines learn to think and act like humans echoing their appearance and actions. The work references both American body performance art of the 1960s and 1970s as well as Robert Morris's work “Neoclassic” in which a naked dancer was filmed interacting with his sculptures at the Tate Gallery in 1971 in a series of peaceful, trancelike actions.",

More than just a link between philosophy and art, his work creates a network of correlations and questions between the two disciplines, addressing the realization of an idea. How does one go from textual representation to a system of representation specific to visual arts? \"Sometimes a picture is better to pose a problem,\" says the artist, \"this is not about appropriating references, but to use them as an order of representation, like traces, memories, and spectra to reactivate.\" In Maire's work, arises the question of the \"making\" of an idea so that it becomes an object of reality, and in this case a work of art.Benoit Maire was born in 1978 in Pessac, France.

    "description": "The piece consists of sculpture of 10 elements, among them: a globe, a picture of a gorilla, a chair, scrabble letters, 3 glasses of black ink, a book whose title is illuminated by the beam of a 8mm projector, a pair of boots, etc. The display is a collection of selected objects chosen in response to the reading of a text by Alain Badiou (the first chapter of the seminar \"Le réel est l'impasse de la formalisation; la formalisation est le lieu de passe en force du réel\" from February 4, 1975). The elements are a visual way to question the transposition of an idea into reality. The challenge of the work lies in translating the speech of an artistic image, which itself generates speech. \"For me the display of objects, is to provide support for a thought experiment, of a philosophy that \"would return to the things themselves.\"  Here I associate these \"things themselves\" to concrete objects.\" In this sense, the work may be considered \"complete\" on the day in which the philosopher will use this display as a possible image for his thought. This network of indices awaits new meanings and interpretations. Emblematic of the artist, this work is rhizomatic. Some elements of this display have indeed contributed to other works made thereafter. For example, the image of gorilla refers to a work entitled Purpose Monkey (2007), while the book Le Bonheur de Vivre presented as part of the display was the subject of a video shown at the Biennale in Lyon in 2007.",

    "artist_description": "Madani’s paintings have a caricatural quality that suggest a satirical intention. She only paints images of men. This came about initially because she ‘didn’t want to deal with the question of the veil, and I didn’t particularly want to sexualise the figures with perked up breasts, so ultimately I was left with men.’ Since making that statement she has expressed an interest in depicting spaces ‘designated for men only’.  Madani’s work can be interpreted as a comment on an overbearingly patriarchal society, whether in Iran or indeed any Western country. Her cartoony paintings expose ethnic and gender stereotypes with a lightness of touch that belies their punch. The painterly nature of Madani’s approach has led her to make films composed of freeze frame shots of paintings that she changes from shot to shot. Born in 1981, Tala Madani is a young Iranian artist who has lived outside Iran since the age of 14. She currently lives and works in New York and Amsterdam.", 
    "artist_name": "Tala Madani", 
    "description": "Madani works on a small scale and a large scale. This work is from a series of small paintings called Dazzle Men that take as their starting point the Dazzle patterns used by artists to camouflage ships during the First World War. Dazzle camouflage was designed to confuse the aim of U boat commanders. Its unstable, brightly coloured distortions were closely allied to modernist painting and indeed formed the subject of a memorable series of woodcuts and a major painting by the British Vorticisit Edward Wadsworth. In Madani’s painting Middle Eastern looking men take as their model an image of a dazzleship for the purpose of self-disguise. Applying paint to their bodies they adopt the strategy of maquillage that is essentially feminising. Madani thereby satirises the overly masculine society these men inhabit. While some have applied only small amounts highlighting their breasts, others have applied stripes recalling prison outfits. These men are trapped in their own world, prisoners of the stereotyping that grows out of education, religion and culture. In conversation with Doug McClemont Madani stated: ‘I’m interested in the behaviour of the masses.  Creating icons, figures and then having later on to destroy. The creation of icons, which then inevitably are destroyed because the icon becomes corrupt, or something. To me, that’s very religious behaviour, needing to put something up on a pedestal. And the mass behavioral tendency of later on of being almost inevitably oppressed by it somehow. Having to bring it down. In a way painting is poking fun at religious behaviour. The masses can behave ridiculously in many circumstances.’",

A large glass plaque associated with a smaller one recur to suggest the proportions of a human body. The glass plaques are joined simply with adhesive tape.

The loss of form or its dissolution is at the heart of the series of lamps encapsulated in blocs of ice with liquid progressively spreading on the floor. The bulb is embedded in the ice. The cubic form is compact, minimal and resembles an explosive device. Once the lamp is switched on, the ice melts inevitably. The color black spreads on the floor to form an abstract landscape. It is as if we are confronted with a common mechanical accident but the realization has a very precise protocol. She makes wooden boxes with silicone which are filled with water that enables the moulding of the form. Electric lights are often present in works of the second half of the 20th century to refer to daily objects (Rauschenberg, the Nouveaux Réalistes) or to transcendental aspirations (Dan Flavin, Mario Merz). Here we are faced with a sombre beauty that destroys the object, the form and metaphysical aspirations while creating a changing form that is close to black dripping covering the ground.",

Yet Koller is not only a seminal figure in the history of the neo- and post-avant-garde; his work has long been a critical inspiration for artists and intellectuals. In the most recent past, Koller's concepts of the Anti-Happening, the Anti-Picture, the Universal-cultural Futurological Operation (U.F.O.), his actions, objects, texts and the enormous referential archive he built up, have attracted growing interest on the part of a broader art public.  From around 1960, in response to the modernist mainstream in Slovak art, Julius Koller began to develop his aesthetic position of the “antihappening.” His strategy consists in using real objects and everyday life as the predefined program for an aesthetic operation: from 1965, in texts rubberstamped on paper that refer to the context of the “anti-happening,” and then in 1967/1968 in pictures for which Koller used white latex paint instead of oils and which saw the first appearance of the question mark—the symbol of Koller’s brands of naming, or “making known,” that was later to undergo many mutations in various media and states of aggregation. The “invitation cards for an idea”—as Koller called the text works relating to the “anti-happenings”—and the palimpsests and serial arrangements of the “anti-pictures” set themselves apart from the academicism of Modernism in more than just formal terms.

Unlike happenings, these actions do not involve the staging of psychologically expressive performances.  As the art historian Piotr Petrowski has noted, it is part of ‘an attitude that aims to erase the boundaries between different art tendencies (art and anti-art, modernist and neo-avant-garde painting), between different forms of neo-avant-garde practice (performance, conceptual art, Fluxus) and, above all, between art and life’[ii].[i] Kathrin Rhomberg and Roman Ondák (eds.), Julius Koller: Univerzálne Futurologické Operácie, Cologne 2003. p.126.[ii] Piotr Piotrowski, In the Shadow of Yalta: Art and the Avant-Garde in Eastern Europe, 1945–1989, London 2009.",

These infinite variations on a common cipher constituted an insistent incantation of the Utopian principle. Friedrich Nietzsche argued that to realize a fundamental critique of ‘bad faith’ means to move beyond cynicism and embrace a radical optimism that exceeds the petty dialectics of expectation and disappointment. In his approach to life and art as the U.F.O.–naut, Koller embodied precisely this: he actualized the potential of his imagination as a form of existential agency. As we get entangled in the strange possibilities of art and ideas, we all become U.F.O.–nauts and are deeply indebted to Koller, our patron saint of U.F.O.–nauts.",

He sought to create new cultural situations that weren't new art, but rather new ways of living: a new creativity for a new humanistic culture. In the face of Communist ideology, subjectivity reclaimed its role with all of its poetry and discord.The critic Jan Verwoert has commented on the significance of this constantly shifting reference: it ‘becomes a metaphor for the invasion of reality by the imagination. As such, it captures the essence of Utopian thought: to confront the microcosm of an actual state of affairs with the macrocosm of infinite possibilities – to show that society can be changed.’ (Jan Verwoert, ‘Július Koller: Kölnischer Kunstverein, Cologne, Germany’, Frieze no.79, November–December 2003, pp.98–9.)",

In The Ring, a project he made in London in 2000, and of which the Tate bought a substantial part, he investigated the history of the area in which the building of the Tate was situated, making images connected with boxing (the site had previously housed a well known boxing ring), the Ministry of Defense (which had a secret printing press in the building) and Tate Modern (that was about to open around the corner). In Drowning Hercules he used bits of wood from Riddell House, a building about to be demolished to build an oversized tree which he located in the defunct swimming pool.

    "description": "These two images come from the series called \"State of Control\" which Kilpper made in the building formerly occupied by the Stasi in Berlin. As a symbol of the past there could be none more powerful than this. By carving into its floor, Kilpper laid bare its history by making images of its occupants and political figures associated with that period of history. Willy Brandt, Guenter Guillaume and Dietrich Sperling reminds us of all the intrigue of the Cold War when Brandt’s secretary Guillaume was passing secrets at the highest level to the East. Seen whispering in Brandt’s ear, he is perceived to be feeding false information. Sperling was a minister in Brandt’s government. The photograph on which the image is based was taken at the height of Guillaume’s treachery and treasonous conduct. The image of John Heartfield standing behind Silvio Berlusconi is based on a photomontage of Heartfield with the President of the Berlin Police Karl Zoergiebel of 1929 thus bringing together Heartfield, one of the greatest and most vivid critics of the Nazi era and manipulator of images through collage, with Berlusconi, one of the most rightwing, but freely elected leaders in Europe who manipulates the news and images through his media empire. These images are large scale and have a dramatic impact. In his use of woodcut, Kilpper’s work resonates with the large scale woodcuts of Christiane Baumgartner already in the collection.",

    "artist_description": "Valérie Jouve has significantly contributed to the development of contemporary photography in France in the 1990s, by drawing a complex portrait of the city, through her series \"Les Paysages\"(Landscapes), \"Les Passants\" (Passers by), \"Les Personnages\" (Characters), \"Les Figures\" (Figures), \"Les Façades\" (Facades) or \"Les Situations\" (Situations). She tries to identify the inidual within a sociologically determined community and shows the relation of the body to the city.\"I am interested by the question of space above all. However, inscribing the figure inside space is not only a formal question as one may think. It is mostly about understanding how the figure can give a presence to what surrounds it. Here architecture plays the role of an emblematic space, used by man to exist. Building and character, perspective and figure: what is at stake is the discrepancy between collective and inidual conscience, considered in aesthetic terms\". (Interview with Michel Poivert, Bulletin de la SFP, 7e série-N°1, October 1997)The straightforwardness characterizing the images of Valérie Jouve, her use of large formats (creating a physical relationship to the spectator) and her interest for « mise en scene » liken her practice to a contemporary combination of documentary aesthetics and dramaturgy, illustrating a distant and sometimes strange relation to the world.Valérie  Jouve was born in St Etienne, France, in 1964.

A part of the series \"Les Figures\", this \"portrait' of P. Faure carries a strong ambiguity, typical of the photographer's images, between realism and mise-en-scene.This photograph is exemplary of Valérie Jouve's work: inscription of an inidual within an urban landscape, relation to architecture, simplicity of composition and strong, yet imprecise narrativity - related in part to seemingly familiar characters or places. The position of the body is somewhat sculptural enhancing the impression of suspended movement, reminding of Walking man by Giacommeti. This reference is underlined by the man's attitude, looking down, introspectively. The character's intensity places him on the surface, as if he were stuck onto the landscape. Despite his being namely identified, the man seems as anonymous as the undefined background behind him.",

He claims that his \"main drive always comes from the pleasure of meeting people and working with them.\" Through the manipulation of humor, collaboration, popular culture and magic, Jankowski creates links between art and people with a certain simplicity and relevance. Meeting with participants and making negotiations are an integral part of his work, as well as the elements of chance and accident. Jankowski's work is about life as it is lived. His way of juxtaposing different worlds and subcultures as a way to explore social systems and their organization is both attractive and serious. In one of his early work My Life as a Dove (1996), the artist was transformed into a dove by a magician. This performance introduces one of the recurring themes of his work – transformation and how the artwork may change the way we perceive the world and its organization.Christian Jankowski was born in 1968 in Göttingen, Germany.

Only one person of the group can directly see Chua and thus each person mimics another from roof to roof, altering the choreography after each passage like in a play of \"Chinese whispers.\" With this performance, Jankowski explores the social organization of a specific context. It brings together people of several buildings in the same project beyond isolation and social barriers of the urban environment. \"In a work, new things, unknown things can happen. The important thing is to initiate a project to bring together the right people. Then the mechanism takes unpredictable paths. Until...voila!..the work is done,\" says Jankowski.",

    "artist_description": "John Isaacs' work encompasses many different media, though much of it has origins in sculpture. The artist continually redefines his style, moving seamlessly through installation, sculpture, photography, film, painting and drawing. Whatever the media, Isaacs' pieces typically inspire contemplation. Whether it is a grotesquely real, severed arm with the word HATE tattooed across its knuckles, or a small, painterly ink drawing of a unicorn, the artist's work always contains a thread of mystical wonder and brutish reality. Through his often humorous mixing of appealing optimism with abject pessimism, Isaacs examines our historically and culturally determined conventions. In so doing, the artist makes no distinctions between high and low, finding instead that all things have their root in the same base instincts. In his work, there is a strong sense of the universal connection that underlies our apparent isolation from one another as well as the presence of dreams, successes and failures of the individual and society. John Isaacs was born in Lancaster, UK, in 1968. He lives and works in Berlin.",

The sculpture appears to speak quite bluntly about Isaac’s own sense of bleak pessimism when exposing a severed tree, the universe’s sacred sign of life and birth. Through the perfect rendering of this encapsulated moment, Isaacs demonstrates the strength of the sculptural artifact and his interest in failure and fragility. It also denotes that a sculpture is capable of giving off a very emotive and sensory feeling in an instant– the crisp snap of life through the metaphor of the break of the tree.",

    "description": "Ambiguous Gestures takes as its point of origin a film Gmelin discovered in his father’s archive. Filmed from a fixed point, it portrays his father in an intimate performance of body painting with a woman unknown to Felix Gmelin. The discovery of this footage was obviously disturbing. On the one hand there is an erotic encounter with someone who is not Gmelin’s mother; on the other hand the performance itself is strangely unerotic and unsensual. The performance clearly references the work of Klein and the Viennese actionists but has an Arcadian element divorced from the Viennese school. Two acts of painting take place; the mutual painting of bodies and the impression of those bodies on a series of canvases. Taking that as his own starting point, working from stills Felix Gmelin then painted his own paintings with the help also of an assistant, thus paralleling the process of his father. He wanted to focus on the painting aspect of the film rather than its erotic potential and draw a comparison between painting and film, further enhanced by the display of stills that forms part of the installation. The grisâtre quality of the paintings serves to highlight the intense colour of the film. By making what in some respects are conventional paintings from this most intimate of films, and painting found images, Gmelin neutralises its erotic charge, making the film ‘innocent, beautiful and affirmative’. While the film is ‘embarrassing in every possible sense’ to the artist, its conjunction with his paintings and the stills transforms it into another manifestation of a utopian project. Gmelin cleanses his father ‘s work literally and metaphorically, washing the film and creating paintings using rubber gloves and brushes.",

    "description": "In Untitled (after Paul Schultze Nuremberg’s Kunst) (2006), from a larger series of diptychs, Gmelin addresses the notion of entartete kunst (\"Degenerate Art\"). Each diptych juxtaposes a portrait of a person considered to be mentally handicapped with a painting that was branded by the Nazi regime as degenerate. Gmelin's source for these images is Kunst und Rasse (\"Art and Race\"), a book by Paul Schultze Naumburg published in 1928. Naumburg, one of Hitler's architects, was a member of the Nazi party and became director of the Weimar Kunsthochschule in 1930. In this capacity he organized an exhibition of 70 'degenerate' artworks from the Weimar Castle Museum. His book was something of a groundbreaker for the Nazi position on modernism. In the book he juxtaposed contemporary works of art with clinical photographs of people with medical deformities. He thus defined the art as pathological. Working from black and white reproductions from the original book, Gmelin himself makes another reproduction in paint. Just as the original thesis, that modern artists were equivalent to mentally handicapped people, is a distortion of the truth, Gemiln distorts his images one stage further. The grey painting, which represents the medically deformed person, is executed in a painterly way. Thus he has rendered a mentally handicapped person in a manner that in the 1920s and 1930s would have demonstrated a modern artist's degeneracy and declares her as a subject fit for art.  Paradoxically, he has disguised the mental abnormality of the person by juxtaposing the image with an interpretation of a modernist work leaving the viewer, for a moment, wondering which image was sourced from a painting and which from a photograph of a living person. The diptych is thus deeply ironic as well as poignant. But by treating the two images in a similar, painterly way, Gmelin also neutralizes the impact that the juxtaposition of the two images has when viewed on the page of the book. Gmelin thus offers a comment on how in our present culture art no longer has the capacity to shock; that anything goes. Transgression is more or less a thing of the past.",

Since 2001, he is world renowned for his series of underwater videos, called “Memorial Project”, which revisit the history and culture of Vietnam, and its relations with the United States. Although the actual filming has an actual dangerous side for the artist and the actors, as a direct connection with Vietnamese boat people, they have a certain dream-like quality due to the slow motion in the liquid environment. typical national tropes which are integrated count rickshaws, rice picking, water puppets and dragons, the yellow star on the flag but these are generally intermingled and confused by overriding American cultural references. Through running performances across cities around the world, titled Breathing is Free: 12,756.3, Jun Nguyen-Hatsushiba pursues his humanistic artistic action denouncing global refugee crisis. His practice also includes drawing and large scale installations. Jun Nguyen-Hatsushiba, who was born in Japan in 1968, was educated in the United States and now lives and works in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.",

    "description": "Filmed underwater, this is the third video in Nguyen-Hatsushiba's “Memorial Project” series which began in 2001. The title already implies the cultural complexities about to be ironically unravelled: Ho Chi Minh is parodied and Okinawa (where this was filmed) was a battle site in Japan during World War II which then became an American training base during the Vietnam War. To a remix of James Bond movie tracks composed by Quoc Bao, no less than thirty divers in wet suits and full gear advance against the water resistance armed with cartridges of color. They attack trestles with blank canvases on which they attempt to paint a yellow star but, after a showering of digital white stars likened to the American flag (presumably alluding to Christmassy snow), they find themselves uncontrollably portraying actors who played in Vietnam-related films like Marlon Brando, Michael Cimino, Robert De Niro… which then, end up leading to collapse and dissolving. Water creates a parallel world, symbolic of universal consciousness, which allows for the slow contemplation of these potentially alienating cultural transmissions. Nguyen-Hatsushiba's dramatized soft critique is across the board, from the sheer weight of Vietnamese tradition on one hand, to America's geo-political and cultural hegemony on the other, as well as the way war is represented in the media and in cinema (Vietnam was one of the first conflicts to have broad coverage).",

    "description": "Vieques is an island off the mainland of Puerto Rico used by the U.S Navy and NATO forces as military testing ground as from the 1940s. Civil disobedience and active protest movements initiated by local inhabitants and an international support network led to the end of the bombings and progressive demilitarization in 2002. Allora & Calzadilla became involved in the defense of this cause in 2000 and made a series of works relating to the story of this island. This video demonstrates the beginning of their ongoing interest in the interplay between militarism and sound. In Returning A Sound, Homar, the motorcycle driver and activist, drives around the island as if reclaiming the territory. The muffler was altered so it no longer silenced the noise and became a musical instrument instead, like a trumpet to announce decontamination and recovery in echo to the terrible exploding sounds that had shaped the lives of the Vieques inhabitants for 60 years. “As artists, we became interested in questions related to the sonic violence that marked this space, as it was exposed to earsplitting detonations up to 250 days out of the year. The first work we made in that regard was Returning A Sound, which we filmed just after the military lands were semi-opened to the public in 2003.” Guillermo Calzadilla, quoted in Carlo Motta, “Allora & Calzadilla”, BOMB magazine, 109, Autumn 2009.",

    "artist_description": "The works of Philip-Lorca diCorcia oscillate between two possible definitions of photography – from a recording system in the tradition of documentary and a system of representation in the tradition of fiction. The use of different contradictory light sources in the same picture is symptomatic of his staging of reality. In Napoli 1996 a man walking down the street in broad daylight is fictionalized by the flash of the camera. Related to the world of cinema in the case of  \"Hollywood\" (1990-1992), fashion in the series \"W\" (1997-2000), and advertising, the photographer questions the representation of reality, between the utopia of transparency and necessary construction. \"I try to criticize the beast I work with. This monster of whom I share my bed with is about me,\" the artist says. His photographs are a space alien in the world of the viewer because of the absorbance of characters. In \"Mario\" (1978), a man leaning in front of a refrigerator is estranged to the outside world, far from the viewer, denying his/her presence. Immobility is also a constant in the artist's work. Psychological tension and dramatical equilibrium structure his photographs like enigmas or like \"moments suspended in narratives that unfold,\" as critic Peter Galassi suggests.Phillip-Lorca diCorcia was born in 1951 in Hartford, Connecticut, USA.",

Crewdson’s method is equally filmic, building elaborate sets to take pictures of extraordinary detail and narrative portent. When he was ten, Crewdson’s father, a psychoanalyst, took him to see a Diane Arbus exhibition at MoMA, an early aesthetic experience that informed his decision to become a photographer. Crewdson’s everyday scenes with charged, surreal moods hint at the longings and malaise of suburban America. The artist uses \"the limitations of a photograph in terms of narrative capacity to have an image that is frozen in time, where there's no before or after\" and has turned that restriction into a unique strength.Gregory Crewdson was born in New York in 1962. He lives and works in New York.",

These scenes are tangibly atmospheric, visually alluring and often deeply disquieting. Never anchored precisely in time or place, these and the other narratives of Beneath the Roses are rather located in the dystopic landscape of the anxious American imagination. Crewdson's process and approach are patently cinematic. This series took shape over the course of three years in collaboration with a full production team. His projects are made both on studio soundstages and on location in various small towns. After the photograph is taken, Crewdson continues his obsessive process in post-production, using state-of-the-art digital compositing and special effects. And in the end – like film at its best – Crewdson's fictions, elaborately staged and plotted though they may be, convey an experience that is intensely real.",

He was a professor at Goldsmith's College from 1974–88 and 1994–2000, where he remained a powerful influence on the emerging British artists. His early work made deliberate reference to the American artists he most admired, such as Donald Judd, Jasper Johns and Robert Morris. Although he was particularly affected by Minimalism and used ordinary household materials in his sculptures, playing against the logic of his sources. In the early 1970s, he exhibited his now seminal piece An Oak Tree, consisting of a glass of water standing on a shelf attached to the gallery wall. In the accompanying text, he asked himself questions to assert that the glass was in fact an oak tree.Craig-Martin continued working in various forms, always maintaining an elegant restraint and conceptual clarity. During the 1990s the focus of his work shifted decisively to painting, with the same range of boldly outlined motifs and luridly vivid color schemes in unexpected (and at times apparently arbitrary) combinations applied both to works on canvas, and to increasingly complex installations of wall paintings.Michael Craig-Martin was born Dublinin  in 1941.

    "artist_description": "Maria Bussmann’s works represent an insistent attempt to fathom the epistemological quality of her medium, drawing. For the artist, drawing is the most direct form of artistic expression, both as a medium of analysis and of communication.  Her work traditionally grows out of her relationship to reading and the generative force of philosophy and literature, as well as personal references such as temporary sites of residence. Authors that have inspired her work include philosophers Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Wittgenstein and Apuleius. Her drawings, at times exhibited as scrolls, exist as open-ended commentaries and annotations to philosophical thinking rather than illustrations of readings or experiences. While reading and thinking, the artist transfers visual ideas that develop in her mind into a two-dimensional space making the drawing expansive. In a transformational process, individual pictorial elements appear like encoded emblems, resulting in a rich textual interwoven fabric. The result is a bulk of sketches made into series around her interpretations of philosophical strands or subjects of reference.Maria Bussmann was born in 1966 in Würzburg (Germany). Having studied at the Academies of Fine Art in Nuremberg and Vienna, she graduated in philosophy and cultural studies from Vienna University. The artist lives and works in Vienna and New York.",

In the drawings rather than finding the optimal path to reach ultimate meaning and materialization, Bussmann never arrives at “Heidegger’s Cabin,” and instead is led off the beaten track to areas she never discovered before. Upon her return from the mountains in 2004 and 2005, she continued to develop the series, leading up to 20 drawings on handmade paper that attempt to problematize Heidegger’s theory on artworks as “things” as bearers of traits, “things” confronting the world of perception, and “things” as formed matter.",

Over the past few years she has traveled to Zanzibar, India and East Africa (including Uganda where she was born), retracing the path of the former British colonists.

Her landscapes are sometimes close to abstraction, yet one can feel in them the power of past violence. The beauty and poetry emerging from the images evince a feeling of wonder mixed with a profound melancholy, in the romantic tradition.Zarina Bhimji was born in Mbarara, Uganda in 1963.

This photograph, which belongs to the series \"Love\", was shot by Bhimji during her journey in Uganda in 2001, but was only edited in 2006. It depicts Entebbe airport, the site of evacuation of Asian refugees as well as the site of a daring attempt to resolve a hijacking crisis by Israeli forces in 1976. Although still functioning, principally for private aircraft, it is dilapidated. Commercial flights use a more modern airport, as though Entebbe airport is too scarred by history to be reused. The contrast between the private aircraft and the destitute building is striking. The work evokes a bygone era as well as the consequences of enforced action. The play of light and shadow is emphatic, the dark interior, with its lattice window frames, evoking prison conditions in contrast to the verdant open landscape. The title of the work refers to Bhimji's father and his decision to leave Uganda, thus closing a chapter of the family history. By returning to Uganda, Bhimji has reopened it.",

Each page of the notebook contains an image of the horse passing the finish line cut out of the Annahar newspaper on the following day. It features the annotations of doctor Fakhouri on the length and duration of the race, on the winning horse and his timing, his average speed, the initials of the different historians and their bets, the time between the snapshot and the passage of the finishing line, a very brief description of the winning historian (here the linguist). These documents provoke questions about historical fact. Why are there no images of the precise moment when the horse passes the finishing line? Does the press authorize the reproduction of false information?

In a number of his works, lectures or texts, Ryan Gander is very attached to details, to anecdotes. He relays some of the information with great concern for exactitude which can seem futile and absurd but creates the poetic shift. He seeks to highlight invisible details of daily reality. All his works are in dialogue with one another. Each title also builds on the associations and complementaries between the works. Ryan Gander was born in Chester, UK, in 1976. He lives and works in London.",

On the first page, one can read the original version in English of the liberal speech by Milton Friedman on “The Story of the pencil”. On the other pages, the same text has been translated into 41 different languages by using Google Translate, before coming back to English. It is significant that Dublin, the artists' home town, is also a centre for IT industries and the site of Google's European offices. The final page becomes much shorter than the original text and it has been transformed into something raher incomprehensible. This work has not only an evident political and social dimension but also a poetic one: how a linguistic journey produces a loss of information but also leads to new interpretations. Kennedy Browne represented Ireland during the Venice Biennial in 2009, where this work was on view.",

The opening of the film presents us with a dramatic process that transforms the documentary image. The lack of human presence makes creates a strange atmosphere in the film.

Time is also treated by Von Wedermeyer as a transition from night to day, from darkness to light. In the second part of the film the abandoned buildings are seen more clearly, more or less demolished. Buildings being demolished not only speak of a crisis, but they also reflect a process of change during a modernist utopias' dissipation. There has been consideration of the failure of older systems, and changes of political regimes.",

It complements von Wedemeyer slightly earlier and more artistic film Silberhöhe (2003) which decried imposed Modernist living model. In Die Siedlung, a voiceover describes and criticizes the different sites on view while the camera moves slowly past a vast abandoned 1930s Nazi army barracks which has yet to be converted or demolished, the building site and wastelands for the new private single family housing area, a constructed pond and finally the 1960s or 70s communal blocks of flats. An estate agent is recorded introducing the newer building site and its future plans in rather deadpan and unconvincing terms, according to him the Bauhaus concept has met resistance from the majority of buyers. A cynical jobseeker expresses his disgust faced with the notion of private property in an interview. The short piece quietly but efficiently denounces the blind pressures of “social reconditioning”. Von Wedemeyer's work borrows from cinematic or documentary conventions (alike or separately) to analyze architecture as well as urban planning and their impact on behavior with great acuity.",

    "description": "Wagon Wheel is a work with a fundamental dynamism that derives both from the rotating movement of the elements suspended on poles and the kicking of the legs of the figure. It is based on a pornographic image by Giulio Romano (ca.1499-1546). Romano had completed Raphael's frescos in the Vatican after the latter's death but was not paid for the work. Ziegler relates how in revenge Romano drew pornographic images on the buildings of the Vatican. The Pope erased them but Marcantonio Raimondi (ca. 1480-1534) turned the images into prints, a series called « I Modi », which were widely circulated in Rome and for which he was jailed. The Pope, realising they brought him into disrepute, gathered them all together and destroyed them. Other artists had copied them, however, and such copies exist in the British Museum. Wagon Wheel is the first sculpture of the figure that Ziegler made. He has since moved into figurative painting but he states that he could not have done this without making sculpture first. He believes this particular work is crucial to that development. It was inspired not only by the Romano prints, but also by seeing a sculpture of hands by Rodin. He feels that most of Rodin's sculptures are too complete for him to be able to work off them. But the sculpture of a hand fired his imagination because of its incompleteness. Wagon Wheel also relates to the sculpture of Ancient Greece which is frequently displayed as a compilation of fragments, with armatures supporting disparate parts and acting as surrogate limbs or body parts.",

    "description": "Enguard Souvenir is composed of a group of eleven elements (ten paintings on paper and a sculpture) which deconstructs and recomposes the context of Tienanmen Square in Beijing. This square is known for numerous political events : the cultural revolution between 1966 and 1976, the arrest of the Gang of Four and protests in 1989 where thousands of demonstrators who were protesting against the corruption of the regime were killed. In this work, Bruno Pacheco alludes to the historical importance of this place, the choice of viewpoints reveals very precise but sporadic details there : part of the mausoleum devoted to Mao, a portrait of him and its frame, a view overlooking the Forbidden City, etc. On the square, two guards stand on their platform, facing each other, executing their rituals. The installation leads one to think about various angles of approach within a historical discontinuity. With a certain spontaneity, Bruno Pacheco crystallizes the gestures of the characters (guards) in his paintings. The different viewpoints are organized in order to construct a rhythmic visual narration. The sculpture is to be perceived at the centre point of the installation, it is the platform also found in the paintings though this one is empty, figuring the absence for the guard and require the public's projection in order to understand the participation of this object within the installation. The artist's cinematographic approach places an emphasis on form, frame and color in order to open a dialogue about the deconstruction of this site through this sequential and fragmentary mode. The worrying distance which is created develops a distinct form which alludes to the unfathomable chasm between memory and reality, private and public space. This work reveals the artist's political commitment and his interrogation regarding the individual within the collective.",

Batniji addresses the representation of the over-identified human and physical space with the geographical and political situation in the region. He distinguishes himself from the fictions that have been previously created in the Middle East and offers a quieter and more retained vision of the of the intertwining tensions and oppositions in this area.Fathers offers an incomplete inventory of portraits that we often see framed and hanging on the walls of cafes, stalls, shops, workshops and other workplaces in Gaza and the Middle East. Often old and yellowed, sometimes dusty and slanted, these portraits rarely have links to the current owner and they relate instead to the person who founded the place and who left long ago. Since these places are overloaded with symbols and signs of presence (s) and disorder (s) but devoid of human inhabitants, or their owners, they become a particular paradigm of some sort of “still life”. This kind of places seem full (of products, objects, memories and signs of life) and empty at the same time. By overlooking different temporalities, memory and regards, or by being petrified, like ruins after a disaster that nobody will ever know,  they belong to the present and to the past.

    "description": "This ephemeral installation by Jirí Kovanda, documented in the same way as his performances with a photograph and a text, belongs to a body of works that took place in his apartment/studio. During an interview with Hans Ulrich Obrist, the artist highlighted that he had never had a studio and that this work space blended with his apartment. A piece of string cuts across the room in a diagonal; it functions as a scale to measure time and space. This element recurs in the artist's work: during the summer 1979, the artist pulled a string across riverbanks. This work makes present – through coexistence and contrast – the geometry and abstraction of this line with daily objects. The string modifies the space in a minimal way since it can no longer be perceived as a unit due to this diagonal. “At the time, I was reading a lot about zen. Even the most ordinary thing can become extraordinary with a small shift in context. And the simpler the shift, the better. It is just about perturbing a stereotype and intensifying a sensation, life”, said the artist in an interview with Guillaume Leingre (Particules, issue 18). This string could function like a haïku, the very short Japanese poems that aim to capture the evanescence of things: perhaps he is materializing a spider's web, a ray of sunshine, the link between two ideas… All Kovanda's artistic practice poses the question of visibility. Having worked on actions and performance, the artist decided to 'disappear' from his artworks during twenty years; in 2007, his performance Kissing through glass in the institutional setting of Tate Modern was acclaimed by critics. Some works are only visible thirty years later via traces and archives; the artist's rehabilitation by institutions and galleries offers a new critical reading of his practice which had until then remained rather confidential. What is particularly noted are his links with the history of gesture since the 1970s. Jirí Kovanda's works have in common a great economy of means. The artist assures that we need “get along with what we have”, which in his case meant gestures, objects, and non-artistic materials, used in interventions or installations. The artworks are incredibly slight and come together in a fragile equilibrium: brushing against passers-by in the street (1977), making a branch hold on two chewing-gums (2008). His actions – theatre with no spectator ? – question the threshold of visibility, until they become 'absurd' (in the etymological sense of what cannot be heard).

Kovanda's 'discreet' actions (leaving a discussion in a rush, bumping into passers-by in the street, making a pile of rubbish and scattering it, looking at the sun until tears come…) are always documented according to the same format: a piece of A4 paper, a concise typewritten text, and sometimes a photograph taken by someone else. In this action, the artist arrives for a rendez-vous 10 minutes early and positions himself to wait alone until his friends join him. Jirí Kovanda introduces slight disjunctions with the social use of time and this action plays with the notion of not arriving late. This work has resonance with a missed rendez-vous, one of the artist's last actions. On 23 January 1978, the artist did not appear for a rendez-vous he had made with friends on a square in Prague, 'disappearing' from his works until 2000. A complex relation comes to be between the action, its documentation, and its audience, posing the question of their meaning. His works have been exhibited some thirty years after they took place for a 'second audience'. “I think that the message was sending out was not intended for the people who were present when the actions happened at the concrete moment they were taking place. The message was intended more for those who would read about them as actions. What I was interested in was something ordinary, something normal, that might happen that way. That’s what they were all about. For me, they don’t have any symbolic meaning”, according to the artist.",

    "description": "Kovanda's street interventions are always documented according to the same format as the actions: a piece of A4 paper, a typewritten text giving a precise location and date, and a photograph. Contrarily to the actions, he took the photographs himself. One of the rules he stuck to in his artistic practice was to always use material at his disposal, a real economy of means. Since he worked in the Prague National Gallery store between 1977 and 1995, he was able to use left-over art handling materials like string, paper, wooden wedges and so forth. Most interventions tended to be small in scale and ephemeral, with no particular audience since they occurred outside the art gallery space (certainly until the late 1990s). The white piles on two parallel bridges are bound to disappear. This poetic installation in urban settings is given two different perspectives, one photograph being a close-up. Kovanda states that: “They were often white... Maybe it had something to do with that out of place quality I was talking about. On the street, for example, the color white seems rather artificial. It provides a certain contrast.”",

    "description": "\"To me, art equals responsibility\".  That is probably why Alain Séchas creates works according to the human scale, immediately evoking the human body. But rather than using the human figure, he chose that of the cat: a round-eyed feline which never smiles. \" Doing cats becomes like a trap, so that we identify a lot with it (...) and all the imagery of the cat reappears: the Egyptian cat, comics, caricature etc\".Chosen as our anthropological equivalent, the cat plays various characters, often provocative, and becomes the intermediary between the artist and the viewer. More than a mere sculpture, he is a drawing with volume, a motif which endlessly changes: \" I have always said that my work was about drawing; a small drawing is as important as a large sculpture and its making is as difficult for me. » Falsely naive, the work of Alain Séchas stands out and opens our eyes, like his cat: « Forcing the viewer to see is to me the very definition of art », he says. With no complacency whatsoever.Peace and Love shows a family with children who embody some of the typical calamities of society written on their T-shirt: \"murder\", \"suicide\", \"gore\" thus criticising the values of the generation of May 1968.",

    "description": "This work needs to be considered in relation to one of his performances during which people were made to queue in front of the Kunsthalle of Frankfurt in 2003 (Tate Collection). In this instance Ondak collected images of people queuing in front of all sorts of buildings in various newspapers. He then inserted these in a Slovakian newspaper without trying to give any coherence with the information in the text on the same page. The result is a fictional space with the potential for the invention of different scenarios. The theme of people queuing encourages the consideration of the relation between interior and exterior but also of exclusion. It can also be a reference to deprivation during periods of war or economic depression. In the manner of works by Felix Gonzales-Torres, the audience can take a copy of the newspaper which therefore leaves the exhibition space. The fact that the message or the artwork circulates is an integral part of the artistic gesture. People lining up behind one another also formally becomes a living sculpture. The refusal to allow the object to be recouped by the flux of liberal economy echoes the refusal of any monumentality which was used so often by authoritarian regimes.",

The description of the blond artist wearing the same outfit and bag in places of transit like airports, stations or streets are faithful in straightforward (verging on naïve) styles. His own skill as artist is displaced and delegated to others with no particular gift in draftsmanship. Taking the role of a commissioner recurs regularly in Ondák's work, other examples include Common Trip (2000) constituted with 128 elements, I'm Just Acting in It (2007) with 24 drawings, for instance. These eight drawings were placed in variegated simple home decoration frames to create a sort of storyboard for the artist's life. For political, personal or economic reasons, not everyone has similar possibilities for mobility. Ondák's act of sharing his memories expands the potential impact of art for a different public, made actors on these occasions. The interpretations give different viewpoints but maintain a certain continuity, as if it is the artist's travelogue once removed. The repetitive descriptions of a walking man have interesting parallels with Francis Alys's two-dimensional work.",

He occasionally gazes through windows into the gallery but never enters.” Passersby are numerous since these windows are by a tram stop on a busy street. It is surprising to note how few of them take any notice of this man peering repeatedly through the slightly tinted glass into an empty meeting room with no distinctive signs to be seen. It turns out this was a performance at the Kunsthaus in Graz. A annunciating drawing with the same title was shown in Ondák's solo show More Silent Than Even at gb agency in Paris the same year; this show also included an invisible eavesdropping device. The uncomfortable connotations of surveillance, whether visual or aural, in everyday situations or art galleries, were in focus. The camera shots following this strange act of insistent staring and squinting vary from different perspectives outdoors or from inside the space looking at him, with consequent shifts in soundscapes. In The Stray Man's exercise in curiosity, nothing happens. This action in the public sphere could appear useless. But this extended, seemingly trivial, gesture is a contemporary poetic take of the act of looking, on its meaning today, its possibilities and difficulties applicable to the art world as much as to human and socio-political permissiveness or constraints at large.",

    "description": "The film Line Describing a Cone was made in 1973 and it was projected for the first time at Fylkingen (Stockholm) on 30 August of the same year. This piece, which was initially screened in independent film contexts, it soon began to be shown at art museums and ended up becoming one of the key works of the artistic movement that opened up the visual arts towards cinema. With a duration of 30 minutes, the film shows the creation of a white curve being projected onto an empty space. A thin mist is introduced into the projection area, therefore the viewer can progressively see (more than a circle reflected on the wall) a large cone of light which simultaneously becomes a light sculpture into which he is invited to circulate. By allowing the viewer to immerse himself in it, and play with this strange substance, Line Describing a Cone becomes not only something made to be seen, but also something to be experienced since the viewer is absorbed into the scene and becomes part of the action. In this way, McCall recreates an inversion: by placing the public facing the projector, he reveals the entire process of kinematics and, at the same time, he destroys any possibility of illusionism, in order to create another, that of magic, poetry and wonder.",

    "description": "This score is a graphic record of the detailed choreography of one of Anthony McCall's Landscape for Fire performances. These took place between 1972-74 in the UK at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, Colchester School of Art, in Reading and in North Weald as well as in Sweden at Fylkingen Society of Contemporary Music and Arts, Stockholm, and in the USA at the William Patterson University, Wayne, New Jersey. Many of these events were photographed by David Kilburn and Carolee Schneemann, only one in 1972 was filmed. Dressed entirely in white, the artist and his collaborators lit braziers outdoors at nightfall, to the sound of foghorns. According to printed documentation, Subcycle 10 lasted 144 minutes between 4.42pm-7.06pm. If one refers to another drawing dated March 1973 in the Getty Research Institute, the numbering from 0-148 are the minutes and the columns with the numbers “12, 8, 4” indicate  the time sequence. The geometric precision of these diagrams documents McCall's specifically imagined spatial plan of interaction with unpredictable elements of fire, air and environmental conditions to create a near ritualistic event harking back to age-old traditions. The grid system formalizes the pacing or staging of this earthwork. McCall had begun his body of works drawing with light with the 'Fire Event' series of performances in his studio in London in 1971.",

    "artist_description": "Madani’s paintings have a caricatural quality that suggest a satirical intention. She only paints images of men. This came about initially because she ‘didn’t want to deal with the question of the veil, and I didn’t particularly want to sexualise the figures with perked up breasts, so ultimately I was left with men.’ Since making that statement she has expressed an interest in depicting spaces ‘designated for men only’.  Madani’s work can be interpreted as a comment on an overbearingly patriarchal society, whether in Iran or indeed any Western country. Her cartoony paintings expose ethnic and gender stereotypes with a lightness of touch that belies their punch. The painterly nature of Madani’s approach has led her to make films composed of freeze frame shots of paintings that she changes from shot to shot. Born in 1981, Tala Madani is a young Iranian artist who has lived outside Iran since the age of 14. She currently lives and works in New York and Amsterdam.",

Madani chooses hard-hitting contemporary topics, often relating to the Middle East, to apply her distinctive expressionist style to. Garish colors, sketchy outlines and broad brushstrokes allow for a violently satirical depiction of society, politics and war. The viewer is trapped in the position of the voyeur glaring at these scenes through the comfortable prism of a computer screen or a magazine and made to slow down and consider these terrifying visuals for more than an instant, encouraged by the different temporal status offered by a painting. The disturbing clown-like grin appearing on the cagoule defies any rapid assumptions and confuses the entire scene to emphasize the sheer absurdity of the situation. Arms outstretched, the figure kneeling in a pool of blood sinks into amorphous insignificance as the stripes covering his body make him blend into his surroundings. He literally becomes a wall painting as the title suggests. Criticizing erasure as well as over-exposure, Madani is definitely one to use painting as a weapon of mass denunciation.",

His broad smile, on the verge of laughter, encourages reciprocity on behalf of the onlooker. This could be said to be a typical tactic in Creed's work as it is so infused with humor and irony. To him, art is like a game, or certainly very much a part of banal reality. Within the genre of self-portraits, this subverts the usual tradition of images of the artist as creator. Creed often jokes or questions whether the artwork (or in this case the persona of the artist) has any value or exists. Standing in front of a very British brick wall which likely carries art historical connections and puns, Creed seems to mock or certainly stand amazed at his own commercial success. In 2001, he won the Turner Prize with his controversial Work No. 227. The Lights Going on and off. “I want to make things. I'm not sure why, but I think it's got something to do with other people.

This architectonic drawing proposes modular possibilities, adaptable variations based on the form of the concrete block (a material which is often actually integrated in his practice). The “re-definition” announced in the title is in construction, in process, under development, in flux. The investigation appears incomplete, but potentially infinite, therefore full of potential. This work is like a claim for the competence of artists to contribute to new visions for society, like a hymn to their capacity for imagination within a larger debate. Cidade offers abstract viewpoints on real societal questions to do with housing and propriety development while pointing to an urgent need for revisiting Brazilian history of Modernist architecture and Neoconcretism.",

He is famous for his choreographed performances under the name Amorales vs. Amorales, staging masked Mexican wrestlers in museums and galleries worldwide. He has built up a Liquid Archive, a digital imagery database, which encompasses personal, political and popular sources. He transforms this iconographic store into his signature graphic style which then transfers into his practice which involves paintings, drawings and installations, video animations and performances. He works with motion graphic designers, media researchers, and musicians to a certain contemporary collective unconscious based on media-driven codes of perception and spectacle. Amorales is versed in the most cutting-edge communications strategies, in the power of strong, bold, catchy signs and signals and near hypnotic perceptual experiences. He develops the full potential of the digital age and decries copyright laws by highlighting the creative opportunities available today.

Airplanes, letters, naked women, Osama Bin Laden, Che Guevara, mythological figures, skulls, wrestlers' masks are some of the visuals that populate this printed object. It was distributed to fortune-tellers for their interpretation of the future. It is also presented framed and hung in a grid or as an artist's book. Jennifer Allen writes in artforum (Summer 2005): “Surfaces can serve blindness and vision: images, decoration and destiny. While linking clairvoyants, psychologists, and art critics as interpreters, Amorales also levels the hierarchy between artists, whose creations are generally treated as singular, and actors and musicians, who often interpret works that have already been produced or performed by others. In the era of postproduction – where images tend to be ready-made – the artist is simply a point of distribution, not the origin of images.”An edition exists in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.",

This trace on the ground is an aestheticized piece of evidence of a real heavily loaded problem for nature and society. The artist's critical stance is poetically and precisely rendered to encourage debate about politics, power and ecology through art. Pure, life-enhancing natural resources are presented as potentially explosive substances in metal or plastic containers. Such absurdity is made visible in the direct dialogue of cause and effect in this presentation which is then amplified by the title, The Nature of Conflict, which adds to the imagination of extended dangerousness. Allora & Calzadilla have created a meaningful and at the same time subtle visual formula for the summary of their alarmed analysis of a current global issue.",

Between fantasy and reality, The Islanders is a very particular universe he has created in which to gather his disparate ideas. His practice primarily involves drawing, sculptures, texts and installations which participate in the epic and dreamlike narrative whole in the course of making. “I discovered a way to create a place where I could lay out and rationalize according to the space rather than to logic. This place enables me to affirm relations between the different elements. Thus whatever I make or write, whatever the context in which the work operates, its ultimate and absolute meaning remains linked to The Island”.Charles Avery has no interest in placing his work within the history of art, instead he is intent on constructing a autonomous environment, purposely distancing the public. “The spectator is a tourist, a traveler, a writer, a missionary, an itinerant, a bounty hunter, a pioneer, in this country.” Amongst Avery's most renowned drawings with extremely composed figurative scenes, there are geographical maps that situate The Island in relation to a fictional archipelago Triangland. Untitled (Map) is one of the pieces that enables the viewer to comprehend the context of this archipelago as well as discover the topography of his account.",

This unforeseen deviation is dissected in terms of affects in the time frame of 5 minutes. The affects that emerge in the piece are characterized by a sense of movement between pain and hope, and a work of association between cancer and expectancy. The concept of resistance and fireflies is taken from [Georges] Didi-Huberman's work on the political relevance of the survival of fireflies as a metaphor for the contemporary importance of an intermittent resistance opposed to an inoperable, redemptive, absolute one.”",

The installation is presented like a “parade of objects”, with images whose historical role has been suspended or their meaning has changed. The references have become lost, through repetition the works have become banal. One can find copies of Suprematist or Social Realist paintings, collages, photographs of political meetings, cemeteries or other memorials. We are confronted with the obsolescence of signs. Colors like red and black have also lost their meaning. Exploitation of the Dead concerns today's religious or ideological ideas which are only extensions of religions and ideologies of the past and definitively dead. Mladen Stilinovic insists that: “If death has to be exploited, this is a violent act and we need to weigh up the consequences.” Collective rituals are central since they evoke a certain collective emotion which can't quite be attained through signs and colors. This work is a way to think about painting but also the modalities of its exhibition. There is also this question of the copy. Why and how do we copy things? What do we learn through repetition ? About loss of integrity ?",

    "artist_description": "Like many artists of his generation, Clément Rodzielski is a well-informed onlooker who works with existing images in order to reveal their mechanisms of construction and circulation. But he concentrates in particular on images which are under our eyes but not seen any longer (motifs found on internet, murals in the urban settings) or don't circulate (retro cinema posters). Based on these images, he isolates motifs or signs, multiplies different supports and gestures in order to reveal their  materiality (wallpainting, collage, cut-outs, photocopies, stencil, spray paint…) and reframe them so they can be seen better. Making abstract images and de-contextualizing them enables better attention on their pictoriality. Repeating the same operations in order to exhaust any possibilities of a gesture, Rodzielski's practice involves numerous series. From pictorial spaces to exhibition spaces, in situ work reclaims its rights as he orchestrates his hang like installation with variable combinations. Clément Rodzielski was born in 1979 in Albi, France. He lives and works in Paris.",

    "description": "These photographs are installation shots of the exhibition De A à B, de B à P at Bielefelder Kunstverein (13 November 2010-30 January 2011). There, Clément Rodzielski had chosen to exhibit the series called Miroirs noirs (Black Mirrors, black and white abstract screen prints) which is emblematic of his work. The piece of painted wood was not shown to the public; it moves and invests the space enigmatically. On the other hand, the painting which dialogues with the works on the wall and serves as a yardstick in space has now disappeared. It only exists in and for the photographic images that keep a trace of its brief existence. The small painting had been entrusted to the exhibition photographer who was in charge of placing the work in the space while taking the pictures. The four photographs were presented at Confort Moderne (Poitiers) for the second incarnation of the exhibition (18 March-8 May, 2011). In this work, Clément Rodzielski considers the exhibition-making process itself and includes the movement of artworks and of the exhibition space from Bielefeld to Poitiers. Protocols for the fabrication, the hang and the documentation constructs a production system which has been imagined for both exhibitions. The artist confronts the documentary qualities of the work produced this way (real exhibition shots/ the fictional intrusion of a “supplementary” object ; a black and white document which flattens the colored painting) choosing an imposing format, worthy of a photographic tableau : the whole installation thus recreates a  space in which we projects ourselves as one recalls that the artist's practice is largely linked to in situ projects.",

This work has echoes in another piece which was presented at the 10th Biennale of Sharjah, Blessing upon the land of my love, in which he develops an installation in a similar modus operandi, this time referring to a suicide bombing that took place in the market the artist goes to. These distinctive works confront us with the same feeling the artist had confronted with such violence, here Imran Qureshi poetically attempts to find a way to expiate these violent deaths and suggest their impacts on the political and social situation in Pakistan.",

    "artist_name": "Bettina Pousttchi", 
    "description": "For Bettina Poutsttchi’s large-format, site-specific photographic work Echo (2009–10), the four exterior walls of the Temporäre Kunsthalle Berlin were covered with a digitally edited collage of archival images of the glass-and-steel facade of the Palast der Republik (Palace of the Republic), which had once been located nearby. That milestone of late East European modernism was completed in 1976. It served as the seat for the Volkskammer—the parliament of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the building lost its political purpose and was used for cultural initiatives. After a long political discussion, the building was demolished in 2009 to make room for the reconstruction of Berlin’s eighteenth-century Stadtschloss (City castle). With the aid of photography, Bettina Pousttchi rebuilt the Palace of the Republic, the historically important building in the immediate vicinity of the demolition site, thus raising questions of the eternal cycle of catastrophe, destruction, and reconstruction in Berlin.  Echo is a photographic work of an altered reality that is implemented in public space. The series of twenty-four color photographs was taken during the six-month presentation of Echo, offering a diverse portrait of this installation in the middle of the iconic buildings that surround it. With Echo, the artist altered the physical reality of the Berlin Schlossplatz through photographic means. By photographing it, she achieves another reality that crosses between architecture, sculpture, and photography in a very exciting way. A selection of the Echo photos were shown in her solo show at the Kunsthalle Basel in 2011. The proposal is to purchase a pair of photos showing the building at different times of the year and looking in different directions evoking different aspects of temporality and politics through the seasons and architecture.",

Here it is no longer the Bible that is reproduced but works by Malevich, Mondrian, Beuys, Duchamp. These artists represent a certain form of utopia in art and are themselves quasi-mythical figures. The fact that they are copying these works from a catalogue reproducing works by Elaine Sturtevant who in turn has appropriated work by other artists (mostly works made by men) creates an even greater distancing in the actions of these copying monks.The authenticity of the artist's gesture defended by Modernism is rejected and recalls the status of the artist during the Communist era. This also considers this post-Communist era in which artists easily enter the economic system of the art market in today's globalized world and proposes an ironic comment on the diffusion of images in this internet age. Rather like in the work by Mladen Stilinovic, this is acts as an interrogation on the loss of meaning of certain icons in Western art, a questioning of the negative and positive consequences of a meticulous repetition of the past.",

    "description": "Lydia Gifford composes her work between pictorial expression and its inscription within an exhibition space. This particular approach implies the performative aspect of her in situ painting. The artist takes the entire environment into consideration from the canvas to the exhibition walls. Time and attention are required to allow the subtleties of the work to reveal themselves in all their complexities in order to find a focal distance which is appropriate to experience the composition. A white wall, a vibrant canvas, disparate elements as  punctuation, and the pictorial gesture that continue on the wall on which it becomes inscribed in an echo with the canvas. She explains that: “There is a subtle balance between impulse and action. Actions leave traces, painting always initially carries the mark of the body, of an explosive gesture.” Intimate and played out in the exhibition space, the artist's work endangers its own apparatus on the occasion of every presentation and thus renews the viewpoints in a perpetual dialogue between the work, the place and the audience. Warder is on the limit of achievement and creates a tension with the exhibition space that fundamentally participates in its evolution. The artist proposes an intimate sensory experience by drawing attention to the vibratile nature of the context and the marking of her gesture. She states that in her work: “Painting allows me to transpose boundaries”. In the painting tradition that Gifford responds to Turner's works are haunted by fog which diffuses light: she brings this up to date with her incisive question of defining a territory to cultivate. Her work alludes to landscape, questions the appearing of a work of art and its existence, the trace of its emergence, the vitality of the initial thrust.",

This piece of work is symptomatic of Cooter's projects which are often arduous enterprises littered with pitfalls, since they imply prospecting and collaborating with third parties whose will determine the success of the project. Forensic Poster consists of a letter, emails and a gouache which translates the artist's attempt to recreate a poster glimpsed at in one of the study halls of the London Police Department of Forensic Medicine. Against a blood red background, the drawing simulates a manuscript note that has been pinned to the wall with a giant nail which carries the inscription: “Nail em”. At the bottom of the image, the injunction is completed by “With Good Forensics”. The dry formal rendering reinforces the smooth and aggressive message so that the spectator grasps that it caught the artist's full attention. The rationale for the presence of the correspondence as part of the work isn't so not much to allow the confrontation between his memory and the original, but to show his dialogue with London Forensics Police.Mike Cooter's  practice interrogates the place of the artist in society and his implication in reality, indeed in most of his projects he works with third parties et integrates them into the artistic process.",

The slightest details are reproduced identically with great minutiae. The facial expressions are absurd, the prim attitude makes no sense. The blasé air of the actors (the artists themselves) creates a comic and  ridiculous shift. This work is typical of Chung and Maeda's artistic strategy in which the hoax is a pretext for  rereading and although the artists are staging themselves, they are also intent on becoming absent. In this literal video remake, the artists question the modes of diffusion of images, copying, artistic territory, legitimacy and paternity. Their practice is characterized by performance, which often involves weighty unsettling humor. Concerned by popular and digital culture, art speculation and self-criticism they play with their presence and retreat, creating some emptiness which is conducive to reflexion.

They are interested in historical figures who were marginalized because they incarnated a sexual “perversion” and who went on stage to seek some recognition in their time. These stigmatized characters are made visible once again by Boudry and Lorenz who revisit archives as a base for their films, installations and texts. These works demonstrate how visibility (since the beginning of the modern period) of these bodies allows for a claim to power, a certain glamour, and a form of recognition. Nevertheless it also contributes to making these bodies pathological or criminal, to devalue them. Their work ponders on the quasi-simultaneity of the invention of sexual perversions and photography as well as they link to colonial economy at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th.  Thus Boudry and Lorenz weave links between different epochs as if to readdress the notion of “normality”. Playing with the conventions of cross-dressing and fetishization, the exhibition of these characters is doubled up with a baroque mise en scène. Totally assuming theatricality in their work, Pauline Boudry and Renate Lorenz's films create their own mise en scène: the set up of the décor, rehearsals, directions given to the actors off-screen, are integrated into the non-linear narrative and allow the spectator to see a film in the process of being made. These films are also very theatrical in nature since the performative aspect is so essential, both in the way scenes are often linked to spectacle, dance or music, but also from a technical point of view since the scenes are often only shot once.",

These actions focus on cycles of physicality and visibility, and draw from her experiences as a professional dominatrix, champion submission wrestler, and artist’s model. Locke often creates a separation between her live actions and the audience through the use of material barriers, live video feeds, multiple camera perspectives, wireless microphones, and mini-cameras. These audio-visual reiterations produce a ripple effect, flattening, repeating, echoing, amplifying, and displacing the action by turning it —as well as the audience performing its own spectatorship— into an image of itself.",

As a result of a hidden vibration machine, the images’ projection screens oscillate vigorously and the contradiction between the shaking screens and the static human figures creates an absurd effect. Through this imposed trembling, Jiang suggests the invisible power that controls modern human behavior.

The wall behind the counter in Former House of General Wang Shu-ming, the Chief of Staff under Chiang Kai-Shek, Cidong Street, I has been painted a deep red. The detailed title subtly suggests how later, local residents may have altered the home’s original color to make it more “Chinese.” The yet-to-be acknowledged history of the occupation of Taiwian and other East Asian countries by Japan during World War II is subtly disclosed in Yoneda’s images.

    "artist_description": "Sun Xun creates videos and animation films from his meticulous, highly detailed, and often monochromatic, hand drawings executed in ink, oil, and crayon. Drawing on the ideas of thinkers like Karl Marx, Theodor Adorno, and Max Horkheimer, Sun investigates revolution, existence, mythologies of society, the notion of time, and the construction and narration of history. Often in a style of magical realism, Sun’s works are full of metaphors and indirect visual associations that beg to be deciphered. He graduated from the print making department of the China Academy of Fine Art in 2005, and, a year later, established π Animation Studio. He has received several awards including the “Chinese Contemporary Art Awards (CCAA Best Young Artist)” and “Taiwan Contemporary Art Link Young Art Award,” both in 2010.",

    "description": "Sun’s animated film 21 Ke (21 Grams) is based on the 1907 research by the American physician Dr. Duncan MacDougall who claimed the measured weight of the human soul to be twenty-one grams. Sun used this episode—which was not fully recognized by the scientific community—as a point of departure for his depiction of a dystopian world in which the narration of history and notion of time are interrupted. Because each frame was drawn by hand with crayon, it took Sun and his animation studio team a few years to complete this thirty-minute film of a surreal journey through mysterious cities, plagues of mosquitoes, broken statues, cawing ravens, waving flags, and flooded graveyards. Here, an ever-present man in a top hat makes obscure, cryptic references in scenarios that include the national anthem, factories belching soot into the threatening sky, and soaring planes dropping leaflets to earth. Rather than encouraging specific interpretations, 21 Ke is a visual commentary that asks essential questions of human existence: Who we are? What have we done? Where are we heading?",

Though she graduated from the China Academy of Fine Art with rigorous training in oil painting, Kan quickly adopted video as her primary medium. From often ignored daily life experiences as points of departure, Kan creates a visual diary. Here, the camera amplifies mundane activities to reveal absurd and eerie details. For example, in Kan Xuan, Ai!, she calls and answers her own name among the crowd in subway station; in Eggs, she squeezes and breaks eggs with her hands, and in A Sunny Day two middle-aged men laugh and tickle each other in a public plaza. In other works Kan engages feminist discourse by situating herself in uncomfortable situations or exposing her body, such as standing naked on a public pedestal in A Happy Girl or allowing spiders to crawl over her in Looking Looking Looking For!.",

Images are rendered in a highly polished and aesthetic manner, creating poetic visual ﬂows. In front of each object, however, lies a coin, ranging from 2 Yuan, to 1 Pound, to 1 Euro or 1 Dollar, silently revealing the material value of these household supplies. Underneath elegant surface there is a deep sense of critical irony, elaborating by the contradictory nature of the cheap plastic items and their sophistic visual interpretation. Kan poignantly and metaphorically comments on the economic and production structure of today’s global market. The most inﬂuential visual spectacles can be generated by the most basic elements in the everyday.",

These reenacted photographs or tableaux vivant are based on French painting section in the Museum of Fine Arts (Lyon) which depict domestic scenes: preparing food; relaxing, reading and playing music; giving charity to the poor or being evicted from home or going off to war.

    "artist_description": "Born in Malaysia, Wong Hoy Cheong’s work examines the formation of his country’s multicultural identity vis-à-vis global migration, trade, colonialism, and the postcolonial circulation of people, ideas, and capital. His extended body of work uses various media—drawing, painting, performance, installation, video, and on-line projects—to critique the impact of these developments on contemporary life within and without South Asia. With the increasingly hegemonic domination of the media industry in everyday life, its systems of representation have become a central issue in Wong’s recent work, which oscillates between reality and fiction, irony and transgression—and gains a new strength in the process.",

    "description": "Re: Looking marks a new phase in Wong’s work which connects his region’s history with other parts of the world. The video—located in an imagined contemporary Malaysian middle-class living room, a space of a fictive former imperial power—explores the precarious link between fact and fiction, fakery and authenticity by overlaying three believable, authoritative forms: a documentary, a website, and a realistic reconstruction of a contemporary home. It is rife with occidental colonial documents and exotic cultural artifacts—the trophy-evidence of Empire-making. The video parodies television networks and documentaries as researched authoritative forms of information. It begins by posing as a serious, believable work of non-fiction, but becomes increasingly unsettling with its inclusion of fictive events, memories, and histories around the urgent contemporary problems of migration, racism, power relationships, and empire making.",

The identity of the protagonist, a red-coated official, is indeterminate and suggestive of both the mercantilist policies that led to the Opium Wars with China and the cultural authority claimed by the Company school of painting over colonial India. Though situated in a particular historical context, The Last Post remains an open-ended narrative with infinite possibleinterpretations.

After the Indonesian Reformation in 1998, Nugroho started to use caricature in his work to criticize the government’s policies about democracy, freedom, and censorship.

Using texts and computer technology, the series draws its reference from various sources—the Bible, Judeo-Christian eschatology, existentialism, metaphysics, politics, among others—to articulate the world’s complexity and the dilemmas that people face while approaching “the end of the world.” The Third Seal is a nineteen-by-twenty-seven-foot projection on a single wall that, together with sound, creates an immersive and dynamic environment. Crawling up from the bottom of the wall are black, worm-like texts that comment on class struggle, revolutionary riots, labor and production, human existence, and social justice. Without a clear beginning or end, the work suggests a cycle and the non-linear nature of history, and, by extension, life and death.",

Along with artists such as Bahc Yiso, Beom Kim, and Lee Bul, Choi was part of a generation whose unique and varied practices gave rise to Seoul’s burgeoning art scene in the 1990s. Trained in Korea during a period of rapid modernization and economic growth, Choi’s work acknowledges and internalizes the processes of consumption and the distribution of goods and has resulted in his being recognized as the leader of Korea’s pop art movement. Often infusing his works with a hint of humor, Choi creates monumental installation with everyday objects. His works also touch on issues of accessibility in art and contemporary culture, concepts of individual authorship and originality in art, and they comment on the privileged environment of art institutions and the prized status of artworks amidst a consumer-frenzied world.",

And though his works share a similar sensibility to Claes Oldenburg’s oversized sculptures from everyday objects, Choi draws from his immediate surroundings and life experience. Public sculptures with a flower theme are often used to decorate the rapidly urbanized cities in Asia, which are constructed with concrete and steel materials. Ironically, these public sculptures are usually also superficial and made from the same unnatural materials. Thus, while seeming to be a celebration of nature’s beauty and the need for imagination when living in an environment with a diminishing natural aesthetic, Flower Tree embodies the paradox of modern life.",

When exhibiting the work, the artist produces a false statement claiming that he has paid an illegal worker from North Korea to wear the suit and to maintain a lounging posture for a certain length of time. But both the performer and the financial transaction existed only in the text, truths concealed by the costume and social propriety. By interchanging physical realities and contexts and obscuring details, Gimhongsok challenges the effectiveness of visual and textual communication to create a potential moral anxiety in the viewers.",

The work is a response to a November 2009 referendum in Switzerland that approved a ban on the construction of new minarets in the country. It was also a crucial moment of Turkey’s negotiation for her entrance to the European community. Instead of making direct and didactic comment on the controversy, Abbas brings forward the question about how symbolic landmark is interpreted vastly different in various cultural contexts. On the one hand, the minarets have been seen as symbols of political Islam in the Western imagination. On the other hand, in the Muslim world, they stand as memory organs that allow the city to recognize itself which are part of everyday objects, belonging to the communities.",

The facility was later used as a temporary prison to hold different people coming from Mexico to Los Angeles during the Civil War. The building’s walls are covered with different marks and inscriptions from that time—what Ybarra likes to call L.A.’s earliest graffiti and which today coexist with recent gang tags.

Voight-Kampf is based on a scene from Ridley Scott’s 1982 movie Blade Runner in which a giant advertising billboard in the midst of a dystopian city of Los Angeles in the future displays a geisha eating candy. Terada used this image as a point of departure to explore issues of racial identity, the nature of photographic representation, and the liminal space between fiction and reality. In each of the three Maiko photographs that accompanied the exhibition, a Caucasian woman poses a Geisha and look directly at the camera. The images reinforce the staged and artificial nature of racial categories and stereotypes, but also speak to the excesses brought about by an accelerated consumer culture.",

These contexts range from the more overtly staged scenario in Silencer #16—the erased magician is about to perform a trick on his assistant trapped on an odd, almost dada looking box—to the more “colloquial” Silencer #17 in which the absent magician’s silhouette appears in what seems to be a children’s hospital.  Rogan’s interventions attest to their own creation by way of the subtle marks and erasure used to remove the original visual information. Such evidence of the artist’s hand echoes the magician’s sleight-of-hand in the image and suggests the illusory character of all representation.

But in the process, McCarthy misremembered their original design of the pants, which had black outer panels and white inner panels in white, and left a black shape highlighted in the crotch area. Instead, McCarthy’s reconstruction divides the pants vertically in two black and white sections. McCarthy’s mistake speaks not only of the fallibility of memory but of a certain kind of queerness that resists any categorical—“black or white”—definition. Memory Mistake’s use of aesthetic formalism, error, subjectivity, and social history can be seen to challenge the tropes of modernism and art history.",

Within the cluster, fashion photography exists alongside frescoes, and demure piety butts up against unabashed sexuality.

Commissioned by industrialist J. Irwin Miller and his wife Xenia Simons Miller, and built by Eero Saarinen in 1953, the Miller house’s open and flowing layout expands upon modernist architectural traditions. It features a flat roof, stone and glass walls, with rooms configured beneath a grid pattern of skylights and supporting cruciform steel columns. Rather than a distanced view of the overall structure—favored by modernist architectural photographers like Julius Shulman—Lambri instead works from the inside, focusing on Saarinen’s windows and the soft, even light. The resulting image is a poetic abstraction, an architectural photograph that yields not only a picture of a building, but suggests what it actually feels like to be in that architectural space.",

A sapling has grown up in the loading dock, and a view straight through the industrial interior shows a field on the other side.

Roy Emerson Stryker, the then director of the program, was in charge of what he called “killing” negatives by punching holes in them to render them unusable. Killed continues Jones’s use of discarded film footage seen in his video created from vintage 1970s and 1980s gay porn that was included in the 2008 Whitney Biennial. By recuperating lost and rather unseen pictures by emblematic American photographers such as Walker Evans, Theodor Jung, Carl Mydans, among others, Killed sheds a new light on the way American history has been written and the crucial role images have played in it.",

While the minimalist appearance of these works references similarly striped paintings by Frank Stella, Hoeber does not emphasize the painting’s underlying structure but instead tugs it apart and obscures it. Layers of paint betray the image not as surface-and-support, but as presence with depth.",

Here, the two-dimensional old-school architectural renderings have become the foundation for new hollow three-dimensional structures.

    "description": "The American War, which takes its title from the Vietnamese term for what Americans call the Vietnam War, has toured the United States extensively with the goal of presenting a Vietnamese perspective of that history. The project began in 2005 when Fletcher visited the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City. He was shocked by images that depicted the lasting effects of the war and the atrocities committed by the United States. Fletcher felt it important that these images be seen and discussed within an American context and, using a handheld digital camera, he photographed all of the museum’s images and labels. At that moment, Fletcher’s project resonated directly with the American intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. The artist took extreme care in shooting the pictures from an angle that would diminish the flash reflection on the surfaces, and paid attention to capture the wall colors and the explanatory labels. In this sense, Fletcher’s re-creation of the Vietnamese installation not only shares important information but also recontextualizes it in a way that comments on the subjective and constructed nature of representation, both artistic and historic.",

The video presents us with a reinterpretation of footage from his unreleased avant-garde film, Easter Morning Raga, from 1966. In contrast to his more famous pieces like A Movie (1958) and Crossroads (1976) which are juxtapositions of fragments from newsreels, soft-core pornography, and B movies, the images in EASTER MORNING serve as a reinterpretation of footage. Here the artist expands the images in duration, gauge, and frame rate, which results in an enigmatic visual transcendence, or “imagelessness,” and distances the viewers from their preconceptions of what they are watching. Accompanied by rhythmical music, the collision of images in EASTER MORNING is not only testament to Conner’s ability to balance order and chaos, control and chance, but further reveals his abiding interest in alternative ways of seeing and experiencing.",

Inspired by new technologies in the auto manufacturing, these “Finish Fetish” artists appropriated industrial materials such as car paint or lacquer to create artwork with pristine finishes. Chicago too was interested in using industrial technologies and enrolled in auto body and boat building school. While the geometric forms, meticulously applied finish, and luminous, gradated hues of color in Domes speak to Chicago’s interest in the prevailing artistic themes of 1960s Southern California, its intimate scale, round shape, and triangular formation belie her career-long interest in using “feminine” forms to promote feminist issues.",

    "artist_description": "Wallace Berman was one of San Francisco’s more important avant-garde artists and is considered by many to have been the father of the Californian assemblage movement (a title he could probably dispute with Edward Kienholz). Characteristically unruly, Berman was an active member of the San Francisco and Los Angeles Beat communities in the mid-1950s. In 1963 he settled in Topanga Canyon and started to develop the body of work for which he would become most famous. The verifax machine, a precursor of the photocopy machine, lent the name to the series of collages with which Berman experimented until his death in 1976. The structural compositional element that unifies the series is the image, appropriated from a magazine, of a hand holding a transistor radio. By photocopying and reproducing the image in sequential form on top of the canvas, Berman mimics the pattern produced by an old film reel. Inside the frame of each radio, the artist superimposed imagery—people, objects and symbols, often taken from pop culture—pertinent to that particular sequence of the work.",

In this film, Aiken’s allusion to “the frontier” and iconic imagery like the cowboy suggest that the American West Coast as a cultural construction. These notions are reinforced by two key elements in the film: its protagonist, the iconic West Coast artist Ed Ruscha, and its reference to the cinematic and the experience of the movie theater. The film is structured as a journey in time, from day to night. The completed film was shot in different places around the globe, including Los Angeles, Rome, South Africa, and Israel, which suggests the blurring boundaries of the unknown and emphasizes both fictive and real landscapes.",

However, it was perhaps his particular use of everyday rituals to explore different cultural mythologies and narratives that separated him from many conceptual artists of his generation. For a period between the late 1960s and early 1970s, Ruppersberg developed several series of photographs that privileged a certain kind of neutrality, stillness, and emptiness that resembled the seemingly authorless images of mass-produced postcards or calendars. But in his works the artist often hid distinct clues, like an unopened newspaper left on an unmade bed in a hotel room.

    "description": "Mario Garcia Torres films a game of Charades among professional actors guessing the former North Korean dictator's favorite Hollywood films. Indeed rather surprisingly Kim seems to have had a huge collection of Western videos and he published a book called \"On the art of the Cinema\" in 1973. As the final acknowledgments indicate, Garcia Torres's work was produced following in depth research, consulting information given by director Shin Sang-ok who has been kidnapped by Kim in 1978, as well as Jerrold Post (The George Washington University) and Timothy Savage (Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainable Development).The motion pictures represented are, in order of appearance: Doctor Zhivago by Craig Wadlin; First Blood by Misti Traya; From Russia with Love by Vanessa Koellner; You Only Live Twice by Nate Harrison; The Godfather by Roberto Medina; Friday the 13th by Gregory Arlt; and Gone With The Wind by Margarita Reyes. Cinematographer: Kevin Merz.The old-fashioned grainy black and white film stock bring a certain distance or an artistic remove from these otherwise known actors in TV series or cinema. The approach is typically modest in presentation in the mode of performance art of the 1970s. The actors' gestures hilariously attempt to represent a film at great speed. The success rate seems high as they evoke the popular culture they are charged to communicate. Strangely effectively they also capture general hints of violence and melodrama in the dictator's taste.",

    "description": "Mario Garcia Torres imagines cinematic devices to replay stories occasionally forgotten by Conceptual art. For him, this is a way of rethinking the tradition in a more personal way, to have a grip on events of recent history and examine them with a curiosity, both critical and sensual. The artist emphasizes the fact that new ideas and meanings may arise from these archaeological narratives. Until it Makes Sense seems to say that faced with the confrontation of heterogeneous elements, coherence can only emerge with the passage of time. It suggests yet that sensitive and personal observation, after all, is a valid form of interpretation of history.Mario Garcia Torres makes his work from already written stories, whether real or fictitious. He creates new narratives based on documents and works of \"mythical\" artists such as Robert Barry, John Baldessari, or lesser known artists such as Allen Smithee or Oscar Neuestern.",

    "artist_description": "Raphaël Zarka presents himself as a sculptor and artist-collector. He scrutinises the contemporary world to draw up a genealogy of geometric forms. He is constantly noticing Plato's polyhedrons (speculative geometric forms) materialized in concrete breakwaters (Les formes du repos series/The Forms of Rest). His work highlights the fact that the 'survival of forms' (Aby Warburg) takes place in today's world in functional and concrete environments. The artist acts with the curiosity of the Renaissance humanists in their studio (Studiolo, 2008), but he has adopted a thinking structure where dichotomies and the methodological boundaries of Art History are banned. With his typical transversal approach, the artist has started theoretical research into the urban practice that is skateboard by publishing essays and realizing artistic projects. In Riding modern art  (Lyon Biennale, 2007), he confronts photographs of the skaters performing on public sculptures with a sculpture by Katarzyna Kobro. The confrontation underlines that the movement is either of aesthetic potential for modern sculpture or a mechanical realization for skating. “It's almost an insult to the mysteries of the world to think that we could invent anything or that we needed to invent anything”; this quote by Borgès has become the artist's motto.Raphaël Zarka was born in 1957 in Montpellier, France. Lives and works in Paris.",

C'est en fait la fin du rail de l'Aérotrain, véhicule sur coussin d'air inventé par Jean Bertin dans les années 70, qui fonctionne comme « un fossile du mouvement à l'échelle du paysage », selon le mot de l'artiste. Ce lieu fragmentaire est un espace de mise en mouvement physique. Il met aussi en mouvement l'imaginaire du spectateur. La Série « Les formes du repos », est une collection photographique d'objets géométriques en béton, isolés dans des lieux vagues, à l'écart ou en attente. Le document photographique permet de rendre compte de ces « sculptures involontaires ». Les formes géométriques épurées (modernistes ou futuristes) entrent en tension avec le décor (un champ, quelques bâtiments à l'horizon). Cette photographie est charnière dans la série, car le rail n'est plus un objet mais un espace. Le point de prise de vue met en valeur son caractère fragmentaire, le rail ne mène qu'au vide du décor. Au constat d'une fonctionnalité perdue, l'artiste accompagné de Vincent Lamouroux a conçu dans le projet « Pentacycle » (véhicule mono terrain, 2002) réactivant le déplacement sur cette ruine.",

    "artist_description": "Pavel Wolberg studied photography at the Camera Obscura School of Art in Tel Aviv. Since graduating he has pursued two careers simultaneously: that of a field photographer for newspapers and as an artist.

    "description": "Une petite fille colon, déguisée en mariée pour Purim, se tient dans une rue de Hebron, attendant peut-être que ses parents ou d'autres enfants la rejoignent. A l'arrière-plan, trois soldats scrutent les immeubles et les toits pour détecter toute menace. Dos aux soldats, la petite fille n'accorde aucune importance à ce qui l'entoure. Son regard est dirigé hors champ, sa grimace marque une certaine inattention. Les soldats ne semblent pas non plus protéger l'enfant, leurs regards et leurs armes sont braqués dans des directions différentes. Deux des soldats semblent regarder l'objectif, ce qui rappelle l'image à la réalité. On retrouve dans cette photographie, comme dans celle avec le petit garçon déguisé, une tension palpable et la représentation contradictoire de deux réalités, celle de la guerre et celle d'une enfance innocente. De plus, dans les deux photographies, la présence du déguisement peut suggérer une dualité et un travestissement des sentiments. Ces images sont violentes, mais tranchent avec l'archétype du reportage de guerre, quand on pense notamment aux terribles images d'enfants durant la guerre du Vietnam comme celle, emblématique, de Kim Phuc. Pavel Wolberg observe les incongruités de la vie en Israël, où poursuivre une vie « normale » peut créer des situations absurdes.",

    "description": "Un enfant déguisé en poulet marche dans la rue ; il se rend ou vient d'une fête, et porte un sac de friandises. A l'arrière-plan, un soldat israélien se protège derrière un bloc de béton, contre les attaques palestiniennes. L'ambiguïté de cette image réside dans les sentiments opposés qu'elle véhicule. L'enfant semble inconscient des risques qu'il court dans cette rue, tandis que le soldat est dans une position de surveillance défensive. Le fort contraste chromatique, entre la tonalité générale grise et le costume vif de l'enfant, souligne l'opposition dans les attitudes adoptées par les protagonistes. A l'image de la pratique de Wolberg, on retrouve ici la tension entre une image documentaire et une construction esthétique. L'indifférence de l'enfant questionne violemment la notion de normalité : pour un enfant en Israël, de telles scènes peuvent-elles sembler « normales » ? Cette superposition de deux réalités contradictoires rend l'image perturbante, un peu à l'image de la série « Bringing the War Home », des collages réalisés par Martha Rosler dans les années 1960 : en introduisant la violence dans le quotidien, elle produisait une critique acerbe de la banalisation de la guerre.",

    "artist_description": "While the pop art movement and the appropriationist movement essentially concerned the iconography of popular media, like newspapers to TV commercials, Kelley Walker is interested in the media system as a whole. Her work frequently questions the notions of author and audience, originality and authenticity, reproduction and the circulation of images. The artist plays with the usual distribution system of the work of art.  The image contained therein can indeed be reproduced endlessly and printed in various formats according to wishes of the buyer, as exemplified in the work Shema (2003). Demonstrating that there is more ways than one to escape the rehearsal process, Untitled (2003) is a steel plate of the recycling logo superimposed over an image. For Walker, it is no longer necessary to appropriate ideas, objects, images but to recycle them: the perpetual recycling of codes and systems inherent in advertising. But also of history, politics, and art in the United States.Kelley Walker was born in 1969 in Columbus, Georgia. She lives and works in New York.",

    "description": "Le triptyque Black star press fait partie de la série 'The Black Star Press project' initiée en 2004 par l'artiste américain Kelley Walker. Les images de cette série sont tirées d'un reportage photographique sur la lutte pour les droits civiques en Alabama, réalisé par Charles Moore en 1962 (et publié par le magazine 'Life') qui montrait la répression envers la population noire et les inégalités persistantes dans le sud des Etats-Unis. Le titre \"Black star press\", emprunté au nom de l'agence de presse pour laquelle Charles Moore travaillait, fait allusion au jeune noir photographié luttant pour les droits de sa communauté, un héros sans nom qui s'est battu pour sa liberté.Sur ces images récupérées, scannées et sérigraphiées, Kelley Walker a répandu du chocolat noir, blanc et au lait à la manière d'un dripping. Ce geste symbolique vient rompre le caractère documentaire de l'image et exprime la subjectivité exacerbée de l'Expressionnisme Abstrait qui s'oppose au geste froid du système de reproduction mécanique de l'image. Réactivant les potentialités ouvertes par les propositions artistiques d'Andy Warhol en faisant ici référence à la série 'Race Riot', \"Black star press\" fait écho à toute la tradition de l'appropriation des images, du Pop Art à l'Appropriationisme.",

By introducing simple signs or gestures – the construction of a concrete slab, displacement of a portion of bitumen on the side of the road, encroachement of grass on a parking, the three artists interrogate public space as the place of possibilities. Their interventions give users an active status with the power to decide on their own environment. For the Hong Kong architecture biennale, the collective intervened in the exhibition spaces. The intervention consisted in constructing a wall which integrated the word 'Anarchitecture' (anarchy + architecture) by omitting certain bricks. Therefore it was as if the word had perforated the wall. Through the wall, the spectator could see the city and its transformations. Thus the spectator was invited to develop his critical outlook on the environment.The collective - formed in 1998 - is composed by Julio Castro, born in 1976, Gabriel Cazares, born in 1978, and Rolando Flores, born in 1975.

    "description": "\"The Lebanese wars of the past three decades affected Lebanon's residents physically and psychologically: from the hundred thousand plus who were killed; to the two hundred thousand plus who were wounded; to the million plus who were displaced; to the even more who were psychologically traumatized. Needless to say, the wars also affected Lebanese cities, buildings and institutions. It is clear to me today that these wars also affected colours, lines, shapes and forms. Some of these were affected in a material way and, like burned books or razed monuments, are physically destroyed and lost forever. Others, like looted treasure or politically compromised artworks, remain physically intact but are removed from view, possibly never to be seen again. And yet other colours, lines, shapes and forms, sensing the forthcoming danger, deploy defensive measures: they hide, take refuge, hibernate, camouflage and dissimulate. I expected them to do so in the artworks of past artists. I thought their paintings, sculptures, films, photographs, and drawings would be their most hospitable hosts. I was wrong. Instead, colours, lines, shapes and forms took refuge in unexpected places. They hid in Roman and Arabic letters and numbers; in circles, rectangles and squares; in yellow, blue and green. They dissimulated as typefaces, covers, titles and indexes; as the graphi  lines and footnotes of books; they camouflaged as letters, price lists, dissertations and catalogues; as diagrams and budgets. They hibernated not in, but around artworks.\" Walid Raad in \"Miraculous Beginnings\", Whitechapel Gallery, London, 2010, p.94.",

Dans un jeu macabre et joyeux, le buste est animé d'un mouvement de balançoire si violent, que les lignes du dessin prises dans cette énergie ne figurent plus rien du corps. Le trait noir pulvérulent du fusain ne circonscrit plus la figure ; les formes se décomposent et se dissolvent dans le blanc de la feuille. Par le tracé de ses dessins ou par la surface de ses sculptures, l'artiste génère des moments d'indistinction entre la forme des idées et le chaos de la matière. Le personnage évoque tout à la fois une marionnette, un pendu, un écorché. Les jambes restent la seule attache du corps au monde, à ce corps dépourvu de bras, et de tête. Comme dans L'homme qui marche (bronze, 1900-1907) de Rodin, sculpture sans bras et sans tête, ce corps « mutilé » questionne un rapport des sens au monde.",

I found the cemetery because I was interested in pottery and ceramics. Research traditions of ceramics were the reason for my trip to Africa in Mali, to understand, learn, appreciate what they did, because it is an important tradition in Mali. And then I discovered the cemetery in Timbuktu. It is interesting to see how the work will take you to discover places you would never have discovered if you did not work. So the link between what you do and what you find in a second time is very interesting. In this context, the exhibition presents one hand tables with ceramics. In addition, photographs of Mali are on the walls. There is no direct link. But it is obvious that the same person who is interested in these things. And there are many reasons for this.",

His images could be considered as studies of natural and cultural phenomena; the Objets de grève ( Strike objects) series (1999) documents objects made in factories during social protests. Moulène uses the codes of media images and diverts them to liberate the gaze and produce a new imaginary. This poetic tactic is manifest in the series called Disjonctions, in which Moulène photographs still lives, portraits, daily urban scenes. The notion of disjunction, which can be interpreted in the grammatical sense ('or', 'either... either...') or in terms of logic (an alternative in a dilemma), is manifest in the image by the disunity of the elements in the composition. The artist is not just a photographer, he increasingly creates relations with drawing, sculpture, objects, texts and newspapers. As a counterpoint, when asked what unites his work, the artist responds that: \"An absurd evidence, a horrible revelation,a burst of laughter...\" (Interview with Briony Fer, « Chaque quelconque », ibidem.) His works tend towards evocation rather than fixed meaning, inviting the spectators to invent their own tales in this “community of storytellers and translators” (Jacques Rancière, The Emancipated Spectator).

Created for an exhibition in Kitakyushu in Japan, it is painted green, a color that symbolizes life and creation in Japanese culture. Even though we are confronted with a hollow presence, this is above all a space to lodge a body in the vertical posture of the living. This form can appear like a refuge – an isolating booth – that allows one to be confronted with one's self, to construct a mental space. In the first instance, it can conjure up the formal questions posed in abstract art or minimalism, but, in fact, one quickly experiences it as an intimate space. It refers to architecture but remains far from any spectacular effect. There are also probably references to the history of relations between color and architecture.",

    "description": "La mise en oeuvre est très simple : sur une feuille de papier l'artiste a tracé deux boucles au feutre noir, puis a placé deux yeux à l'intersection des traits. Ces deux yeux, découpés dans une photographie, appartiennent au même regard. La première vertu d'un noeud coulant est sa simplicité : un noeud basique, qui nécessite une petite longueur de corde. Ce collage constitue « un dessin programmatique, une sorte de mode d'emploi », des oeuvre et des photographies de Moulène. Ne parle-t-on pas de manière commune de l'oeil du photographe ? Le noeud coulant pourrait être « une sorte de hiéroglyphe de la vision » (« Paragraphes pour Jean-Luc Moulène », ibid.) : le noeud de tout est l'oeil, le fil conducteur est le nerf optique, vecteur des informations. Ce collage questionne notre regard qui ne peut embrasser les deux yeux en même temps (littéralement regarder dans les yeux), comme dans la série Les filles d'Amsterdam (photographies de prostituées mettant sur le même plan visage et sexe). Dans un entretien, l'artiste analyse son oeuvre en proposant un scénario qui active le dessin : « en fait, c'est la question de la figure. Tracer, c'est toujours partager, et il se passe quelque chose d'assez étonnant quand ce tracé se reboucle : cette réflexivité produit la figure. Puis on s'aperçoit qu'en tirant sur les traits pour écarter les yeux, à un moment ils se trouvent bloqués ; et si on écarte les autres traits, les deux yeux finissent par se coller l'un à l'autre. C'est comme si ces yeux roulaient dans leurs propres orbites. [...] Et de fait, je crois que la pensée est dehors, qu'il n'y a pas de place pour elle dans la viande. Ce qui nous permet de penser, c'est l'autre, c'est l'espace social, c'est le dehors de notre corps ».",

    "description": "Il pleut, Paris, 1er juillet 2000, qui pourrait être le refrain d'une chanson, est le titre d'une photographie d'un moment minimal, une vision de piéton parisien, une fleur coupée gisant sur un trottoir moucheté de gouttes de pluie. Est-ce un moment capté sur le vif, ou une mise en scène? Il y a une forme de hiatus dans l'image ; les plans - motif et fond - associent une nature en pleine floraison, pure, fragile, éphémère avec le bitume gris et pesant. Au calme des gouttes de pluie dans « Il pleut, Paris, 1er juillet 2000 », répond le bouillonnement de « La Fontaine des Amoureux, Paris, 3 avril 2006 ».  Alors que le « Noeud coulant » (également dans la collection Kadist) proposait un chemin de pensée et de recherche, les éléments de cette photographie s'organisent de manière rhizomique. Les gouttes de pluie et les pétales de fleur forment un réseau de points, que le spectateur peut mentalement relier et recomposer. La première se serre, la seconde se disperse. Le motif tend à fusionner avec le fond pour ne créer qu'un seul plan. L'image tend à la planéité, un peu comme dans les tapisseries médiévales dites « millefleurs » ou dans les tissus à imprimé fleuri. Dans la série récente « Fleurs » (2008) l'artiste a photographié des fleurs des champs, en les plaçant devant des fonds colorés ce qui les extraient de leur cadre naturel bucolique.",

The artist always is on the outlook for images, underlined by simplicity, avoiding the spectacular. He questions the manner in which a subject creates its own mental images, apart from images which are generally available in movies, magazines or urban spaces. In the movie No Show (2004), a narrator delivers an unusual guided tour at the Hermitage Museum in 1941 where the collection has been removed and only the empty frames are left hanging on walls. These guided tours in a museum emptied of works projects us into a fantastic world.

Un écran aveugle sur lequel apparait des hallucinations se forme sur les yeux coupés de toute sollicitation visuelle. Le sujet peut voir cette projection, cependant l'impossibilité d'enregistrer ces images mentales transforme ce phénomène en une expérience intime et personnelle. En 1954, un scientifique a étudié ce syndrome sur des prisonniers enfermés dans des cellules obscures. C'est un phénomène qui est également sensible chez des conducteurs de camion pris dans une tempête de neige. Melvin Moti s'intéresse à la relation entre hallucination et formalisme. Des formes constantes et des formes géométriques apparaissent de manière récurrente. Une forme constante est une forme dont l'interprétation n'est pas basée sur une contingence culturelle, mais qui apparaît à différentes époques et dans différentes cultures ; des formes sans histoire et sans futur. The Prisoner's Cinema est composé d'images abstraites, des rayons de lumière traversant un vitrail, et des explications d'un scientifique décrivant sa vision après avoir subi une privation sensorielle pendant plusieurs jours. Il est ici question des origines du cinéma, de la création d'une image, du pouvoir imageant du sujet, de l'inconscient, de l'histoire de l'abstraction et du formalisme.",

In addition, he has often produced accompanying objects for these events.

This exhibition, destined to tour in various locations, presents the original pages of the magazines, including 'Harper's Bazaar', 'Esquire', 'Nova' and 'The Sunday Times Magazine'. As Pierre Leguillon states on the exhbition's publication: 'The mythology surrounding Diane Arbus' character is willingly set aside to offer a more neutral point of view on a more unfamiliar part of her work, although it was mass-distributed. Many of the characters portrayed in these commissioned works seem less sensational at first glance than the 'freaks' that made Diane Arbus' work so famous, since the retrospective MOMA organized in 1973 in New York, two years after her suicide. And yet, \"leafing through\" all her contributions for the press, the Diane Arbus \"method\", her installing the model in an environment in such a particular way, emerges obviously. Long sitting sessions, sometimes repeated, were destined to allow the model to « let go », while he never stopped fixing the camera, straight forward. It is no doubt their rigorous construction that enables these images, still today, to be contemporary.'",

    "description": "Kovanda's 'discreet' actions (leaving a discussion in a rush, bumping into passers-by in the street, making a pile of rubbish and scattering it, looking at the sun until tears come…) are always documented according to the same format: a piece of A4 paper, a concise typewritten text, and sometimes a photograph taken by someone else. This action, walking abnormally slowly, questions the place of the individual within the space of a city with regards to social habits. Kovanda places himself slightly outside the regulated rhythm of the city walking. “A [certain] reading consists in analyzing the artist's micros-interventions which have taken place in the public sphere during the Soviet era in Prague specifically as political art which the artist refutes.” (extract from the journal Particules). Was he noticed as 'suspect'? His footsteps mime prudence, as if there was a potential risk underfoot. The title describes and at the same time renders poetic the artist's walk. Walking is equivalent to creating, according to Thierry Davila (Marcher, créer, éditions du Regard, 2007). A complex relation comes to be between the action, its documentation, and its audience, posing the question of their meaning. His works have been exhibited some thirty years after they took place for a 'second audience'. “I think that the message I was sending out was not intended for the people who were present when the actions happened at the concrete moment when they were taking place. The message was intended more for those who would read about them as actions. What I was interested in was something ordinary, something normal, that might happen that way. That’s what they were all about. For me, they don’t have any symbolic meaning”, according to the artist.",

Yet Koller is not only a seminal figure in the history of the neo- and post-avant-garde; his work has long been a critical inspiration for artists and intellectuals. In the most recent past, Koller's concepts of the Anti-Happening, the Anti-Picture, the Universal-cultural Futurological Operation (U.F.O.), his actions, objects, texts and the enormous referential archive he built up, have attracted growing interest on the part of a broader art public.  From around 1960, in response to the modernist mainstream in Slovak art, Julius Koller began to develop his aesthetic position of the “antihappening.” His strategy consists in using real objects and everyday life as the predefined program for an aesthetic operation: from 1965, in texts rubberstamped on paper that refer to the context of the “anti-happening,” and then in 1967/1968 in pictures for which Koller used white latex paint instead of oils and which saw the first appearance of the question mark—the symbol of Koller’s brands of naming, or “making known,” that was later to undergo many mutations in various media and states of aggregation. The “invitation cards for an idea”—as Koller called the text works relating to the “anti-happenings”—and the palimpsests and serial arrangements of the “anti-pictures” set themselves apart from the academicism of Modernism in more than just formal terms. Koller foregoes every form of technical mastery. The “anti-pictures” are amateurish in style, ensuring that they fulfill their task, defined by Koller as “engaging rather than arranging.”Julius Koller was born in 1939 in Piestany, Slovakia.

After lifting her name from a popular brand of school notebooks, Claire Fontaine declared herself a \"readymade artist\" and began to elaborate a version of neo-conceptual art that often looks like other people's work. Working in neon, video, sculpture, painting and text, her practice can be described as an ongoing interrogation of the political impotence and the crisis of singularity that seem to define contemporary art today. But if the artist herself is the subjective equivalent of a urinal or a Brillo box - as displaced, deprived of its use value, and exchangeable as the products she makes - there is always the possibility of what she calls the \"human strike.\" Only two years old, Claire Fontaine uses her freshness and youth to make herself a whatever-singularity and a existential terrorist in search of subjective emancipation.

Peux-tu dire quelque chose sur ce concept - si ça en est un - et comment il informe (infecte) tes activités et tactiques ? Claire Fontaine : La série des néons en plusieurs langues 'Etrangers partout' (Foreigners Everywhere), par exemple, vient du nom d'un collectif d'anarchistes de Turin qui combat le racisme dans ses multiples manifestations. L'ambivalence de leur nom m'a fait penser aux effets qu'il pourrait avoir s'il avait été matériellement déplacé dans des lieux et des contextes différents. Il est clair qu'aujourd'hui l'immigration et l'émigration sont plus des simples épiphénomènes liés à l'économie. Ce sont des expériences existentielles et perceptives à part entière. Quant à l'étrangeté que nous pouvons tous ressentir devant un monde entièrement fabriqué et gouverné par des logiques insensées, elle peut certainement être un moteur pour la lutte. Dans l'idée de grève humaine il y a beaucoup de choses qui viennent de Brecht, de ce qu'il décrit comme un processus de « devenir étranger » aux rapports de pouvoir qui nous constituent, pour produire - dans cet intervalle du flux normal des choses - des événements. Je crois aussi que dans notre travail l'usage de différentes langues n'est pas une coquetterie. Il vient du fait d'être des gens qui sont nés ailleurs et sont partis sans une raison particulière si ce n'est que celle de ne plus être chez-soi. Dans l'usage d'une langue qui n'est pas la sienne propre se manifestent des contradictions, des rapports de force, des violences, que la langue maternelle noie ou émousse. La lutte avec le sens donne alors forme à ce que Deleuze et Guattari disent trouver chez Kafka, la« langue étrangère dans la langue » et au fond c'est bien celle-ci que les artistes cherchent à parler. Ce n'est que dans cette impropriété qui gît une promesse de communauté ». Claire Fontaine interviewée par John Kelsey, disponible sur le site de l'artiste",

    "artist_description": "The works of Philip-Lorca diCorcia oscillate between two possible definitions of photography – from a recording system in the tradition of documentary and a system of representation in the tradition of fiction. The use of different contradictory light sources in the same picture is symptomatic of his staging of reality. In Napoli 1996 a man walking down the street in broad daylight is fictionalized by the flash of the camera. Related to the world of cinema in the case of  \"Hollywood\" (1990-1992), fashion in the series \"W\" (1997-2000), and advertising, the photographer questions the representation of reality, between the utopia of transparency and necessary construction. \"I try to criticize the beast I work with. This monster of whom I share my bed with is about me,\" the artist says. His photographs are a space alien in the world of the viewer because of the absorbance of characters. In \"Mario\" (1978), a man leaning in front of a refrigerator is estranged to the outside world, far from the viewer, denying his/her presence. Immobility is also a constant in the artist's work. Psychological tension and dramatical equilibrium structure his photographs like enigmas or like \"moments suspended in narratives that unfold,\" as critic Peter Galassi suggests.Phillip-Lorca diCorcia was born in 1951 in Hartford, Connecticut, USA.",

    "description": "Pour cette série, Philip-Lorca diCorcia a arpenté les environs de Santa Monica Boulevard à Los Angeles à la recherche de modèles, prêts à poser dans des chambres d'hôtel, selon des scénarios préparés à l'avance. « Je retournais dans la rue comme les clients ordinaires des prostitués. Je m'avançais et je leur disais : « Je veux vous prendre en photo, je vous paierai exactement ce que l'on vous paie pour une passe » » selon les mots de l'artiste. « Gérald Hughes (a.k.a Savage Fantasy); about 25 years old; Southern California; $50 » : nom, surnom, âge, lieu, tarif ; soit un titre descriptif manifestant une conscience aiguë des paramètres d'enregistrement et de la nature de l'acte photographique. DiCorcia porte un regard sur le cinéma hollywoodien en reprenant une construction par plans. La composition - de l'ordre du montage - fait se rencontrer par un jeu d'emboitement de cadres (porte, miroir, télévision, cadrage de la photographie) un prostitué et un présentateur Tv. La fixité de ce face à face confronte la sphère de l'intime à la sphère sociale. Un certain engagement et une dimension politique ressortent en filigrane de ce travail, surtout si on prend en compte que la série a été réalisée avec une bourse du National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) dans un contexte où la politique américaine était conservatrice. L'artiste construit « un fantasme désespéré du monde hollywoodien » (Peter Galassi) à travers une image «hiatus », entre monde de rêve et réalité inconfortable.",

    "artist_description": "Linguists, semiologists and graphic designers by training, Angela Detanico and Raphaël Lain consider the use of graphic signs in society. They are interested in the notion and notation of time and create new typographies by substituting letters from traditional alphabets with forms taken from the everyday. These forms are then displayed in the exhibition spaces which allows for a new materiality to be read. Detanico & Lain consider the role of language. Language reveals its double function, as a communication tool as well as an instrument for reading and a reflection on different cultures.Oscillating between rudimentary techniques and cutting edge technology, their works take such diverse forms as letters, words, still images, animation, sound and installation. Whether alphabets, cartographies or calendars, they address the actual foundations of these codes that govern our daily lives, certain of the operative links between signs and meaning.

Keren Cytter is interested in human behavior and modes of communication. Often shot in modest interiors, her films depict dysfunctional families and friendships on the verge of breakdown. In the words of her former teacher, Marlene Dumas, when commenting on Cytter's dark humor,\"it is not a funny hahaha humor, nor a sour humor. It is humor as an insult. It comes from a cruelty, a keen intelligence mixed with extreme emotional vulnerability and an acute awareness of one's own stupidity and inability to understand one another. \"Keren Cytter was born in 1977 in Tel Aviv.

Ici il semble que l'on assiste au drame d'une famille recomposée, auquel il faut ajouter un adultère et finalement un meurtre.  Le décor de ce nouveau film quitte pour la première fois l'intérieur domestique pour occuper une scène de théâtre, l'espace de représentation par excellence. Les dialogues, les accessoires ou les mouvements de caméras bouleversent la frontière entre la scène et les coulisses, c'est l'envers du décor qui est mis en scène. Difficile de distinguer le devant du derrière, le texte récité de l'improvisation, les dialogues joués ou réels des acteurs. Comme dans ses autres films, on est spectateur d'une réalité construite et artificielle, mais l'élément théâtral complexifie notre rapport aux personnages. Sont-ils les acteurs d'une mise en scène ou de leur propre vie? Dans \"Untitled\", l'artiste va jusqu'au bout d'une fusion entre la théâtralité sur scène et dans la vie proposant finalement une performance permanente.  Lors de sa présentation à la Biennale de Venise, le film était projeté dans une boîte ouverte sur les côtés; le public était assis sur des gradins comme au-devant d'une scène de théâtre",

En 1997, une petite ville d'une région agricole de Chine centrale, près de la frontière tibétaine, s'est autoproclamée le lieu qui avait inspiré Shangri-la. Rapidement, une douzaine d'autres villes de la même zone ont revendiquées être ce paradis sur terre, déclenchant une bataille marketing sans pitié, qui fit rage jusqu'à ce que le gouvernement intervienne. Le miroir, utilisé pour construire la maquette de la montagne, est fortement symbolique et revient souvent dans les oeuvres de l'artiste ; dans la littérature et les arts plastiques, il représente le passage entre la réalité et le monde du rêve, fait de projections et de désirs. Le travail de Patty Chang porte sur la réalité et la fiction inhérentes à un lieu existant à la fois dans son incarnation concrète et son mythe. Elle explore l'idée d'un voyage réel vers un lieu imaginaire.

    "artist_description": "From screen-printing to sculpture, as well as painting and installation, Stéphane Calais multiplies the figures of style, underpinned by the lines of drawing, all in playful and sweet world, at times disturbing. All mediums used by the artist, associated intimately with the world of drawing, exist as extensions of the sheet of paper. His series of \"sculpture collage\" titled \"Ornement, crime et délice\" illustrate his interest in the density and variety of styles and materials: nets hanging from the ceiling supporting basketballs, plants, feathers, etc. Decoration is not incidental, but is a dynamic network internal to his works. Collage is \"a way to settle the real\" as the artist suggests and \"to cross temporalities, always on the mode of the diverse.\" While some violence is present between the lines, like all tales, his work contains two levels of reading. For example, Calais is fascinated by the work and the tragic fate of Bruno Schulz, a Polish-Jewish writer and artist, who \"is one of the designers of fantasy, this great line that forges a truly global world\" as depicted in the installation \"La chambre de Schultz\" (2007-2008).

Basée sur une pratique du dessin comme étude, cette oeuvre fait écho aux nombreux carnets de croquis de l'artiste, mais aussi à la série de « Magnolia » (dessins dont le trait est traduit en sculpture par un fil de métal peint, 2008). « Le sujet est une sorte de minimum culturel (le végétal). L'herbier tend à ce minimum là » selon Stéphane Calais. Cette oeuvre s'inscrit dans la tradition de la peinture de la nature morte, oscillant entre prouesse technique et vanité. La métaphore du végétal comme réseau et comme ornement est récurrente dans son oeuvre : typographie arborescente, peinture murale (« Le haricot magique du petit Jack », Caisse des dépôts et des consignations de Paris, 1997), sculpture de jardin (exposition « Garden are for people ! (& art for us!) », Abbaye de Maubuisson, 2005). Miroitement de la surface comme un glacis, légèreté de l'accrochage par des pinces, frémissement au moindre souffle, fragilité du sujet, contribuent à évoquer un esprit rococo. On peut tout à fait imaginer que L'Herbier aurait pu prendre place dans le Petit Trianon, (Ange Jacques Gabriel, jardin de Versailles, 1773), comme un point d'équilibre entre sobriété et richesse de l'ornement. Dans un entretien, l'artiste a parlé du fonctionnement de cette oeuvre comme celui d'un château de cartes, où tout est apparent et transparent : le tour est évident. Cependant, la superposition en un « bloc sédimentaire » des différentes feuilles fait naitre (par surprise) les images ; ces images légèrement brouillées ne peuvent pas se révéler de manière immédiate et limpide.",

Frequently in her work, she is the main model. In the series of \"Suites françaises\"(French suites) made during a residency of three months at the Musée Nicéphore Niepce at Chalon-sur-Saône in 1999, the artist questions her relation to a foreign language, showing the difficulty in naming things with \"post it\" stickies. From this work emerges a sense of autobiographical intimacy, of which the camera exists as an absent witness. The artist captures decisive emotional states: the skin texture of a dancer in rehersal, a fine arts model posing as a Degas nude, a state of mind before leaving...The theme of landscape links introspection and contemplation as revealed in her self-portaits. One thinks of Caspar David Friedrich who stressed in his paintings that art played a role as mediator between nature and man. When referring to her work  Brotherus has stated, \"For me, photography is primarily a constructed image. I consider myself a \"maker\" of images, or perhaps as someone who finds images.

Le détail des nez rouges, qui ponctuent l'image, réinterroge le sens par l'introduction de l'absurde dans des questions contemporains de portée mondiales. « Un grand écart à la fois critique et ludique qui prend garde à ne pas réaliéner ses sujets. Les jeunes militants altermondialistes ne sont pas dépréciés, ils sont plutôt imagés dans un moment de désarroi qui ne semble pas extérieur à Olaf Breuning lui-même.

    "artist_description": "Collector Barbara Bloom mixes autobiographical details, fictional narratives, and literary quotes. She arranges images and objects, and at the same time she makes transparent fetishitic qualitites which bind her to her objects and installations. The series entitled \"Broken Objects\" (2001) features celadon-colored porcelain broken by the artist then \"repaired\" with gold, according to an ancient Japanese technique. Fractures in the porcelain reveal the object's fragility and imperfection. Like a precious scar, the porcelain's fracture tells it's story. The artist compares herself to a detective who unleashes meaning inside of small details. Bloom belongs to the generation of post-modern artists such as Cindy Shermann, Barbara Kruger, Richard Prince, etc. who analyze visual culture and expose its underlying ideologies. Although her practice is conceptual, it is based on objects that she likes or intrigue her. Through her decorative arrangements she refers to museography and the history of museums (the use of vitrines, wall text, name placards, lighting, etc.) and the way the eye operates inside of this context. Her interest in the question of perception is not only related to the visible and its limits, but also to representation, with particular regard to women's place in history, which explains why she plays with sentimentality, femininity and elegance in some of her objects. Bloom was Jason Dodge's professor with whom she shares a sense of metonymy: anecdotes of universal dimensions, the object as a trace, as well as memory and vanity.Barbara Bloom was born in 1951 in Los Angeles. She lives and works in New York.",

    "description": "Dans les années 1980, en parcourant un marché aux puces parisien, Barbara Bloom tombe sur une aquarelle anonyme (datant d'environ 1960), une étude vraisemblablement réalisée par un décorateur d'intérieur pour l'aménagement d'une chambre à coucher. L'artiste voit dans ce décor quelque chose qu'elle estime de typiquement parisien. L'aquarelle est encadrée avec un passe-partout en carton. En soulevant celui-ci, Bloom découvre tous les essais de couleur et de touche dans les marges du dessin. Ces détails qui ne sont pas sensés être visibles, retiennent son attention.  L'installation The Bedroom prend cette étude comme point de départ. Barbara Bloom transpose en quelques sortes cette chambre fictive — on ne saura jamais si le décor fut réalisé — en installation tridimensionnelle. L'oeuvre présente plusieurs éléments liés à la perception de cette image : une reproduction de cette étude, la reproduction d'une autre aquarelle qui figure dans le décor, et un tapis reprenant le sol de la chambre dépeinte (détail du tapis sous le lit, ombre de la chaise) et l'étendant aux touches de peinture présentes sur les bords de l'étude. Les deux reproductions sont accrochées au mur, peint en jaune clair pour reprendre la couleur des murs dans l'étude. Au sol, le tapis finalise l'aspect domestique de l'installation tout en devenant lui-même un tableau expressionniste quasi-abstrait. L'installation joue une réflexion picturale en mêlant les différents plans : avec l'effet de perspective reporté sur le tapis, les essais d'aquarelle prennent autant d'importance que les éléments « réels » et deviennent comme un motif décoratif.",

    "description": "This image is an extract from a notebook in the archives of doctor Fakhouri that lists the cars that have been used for bombs between 1975 and 1991. Each page of the notebook contains a collage of an image of a car with the same make, model and color as the exploded car with a text in Arabic that gives the details of the place, time and date of the explosion, the number of people in the accident, the perimeter of destruction, the weight and the type of explosive. The images of the cars made visible are only equivalents since the cars that actually exploded are totally destroyed. Doctor Fakhouri made reconstitutions while the information collected in the media itself is subject to interpretation. The composition of these images in space is another distancing from the real fact. It is a little known fact that Lebanese historians were also gamblers during the war. They met every Sunday at the race courses. Race after race, the historians were positioned behind the press photographers who were there to take a picture of the winning horse passing the finishing line. The historians betted on how many fractions of seconds before or after passing the line the photograph would be taken. That is to say that no photo showed the horse on the finishing line. Each page of the notebook contains an image of the horse passing the finish line cut out of the Annahar newspaper on the following day. It features the annotations of doctor Fakhouri on the length and duration of the race, on the winning horse and his timing, his average speed, the initials of the different historians and their bets, the time between the snapshot and the passage of the finishing line, a very brief description of the winning historian (here the linguist). These documents provoke questions about historical fact. Why are there no images of the precise moment when the horse passes the finishing line? Does the press authorize the reproduction of false information? Conscious of the impossibility of capturing the exact moment, the historians bet not on the horses but on the photographer's margin of error. The evidence about an event is not necessarily linked to the production of an objective document. There can be no certain objectivity with photographic material.",

Though impersonal and abstract, they are capable of generating and conveying emotions and moods, as the artist herself says: “I use contracts as an artistic medium to create imaginary structures for possible relationships between people, spaces, objects and periods of time.

In the work \"Pirates Who's Who,\" tactics of assemblage are recognizable on all levels. The artist makes use of an eccentric shelf by designer Ron Arad, displaying dripping paint on the wall while the shelf itself holds a collection of books on piracy, compiled together by the owner of the work. \"Power chords\" (2005), perhaps the most ambitious project by the artist to date, is both a work for publication and several exhibitions. The installation depicts automatic electric guitars, playing scores orchestrated by a computer program. The chords are defined by color sequences derived from André Cadere's wooden segments. Yet with Afif's displacement, the artist hints to the color and rhythmic sound dimensions vis-à-vis Cadere, inside a genre of synesthesia. In an age of numerical technology, Cadere's rhythmic system echoes in a particular manner together with the processes of digitization. Afif suggests a principle of encoding the world underlying the real, or rhythmic language before the Tower of Babel. Saâdane Afif was born in 1970 in Vendome, France.

    "artist_description": "Raphaël Zarka presents himself as a sculptor and artist-collector. He scrutinises the contemporary world to draw up a genealogy of geometric forms. He is constantly noticing Plato's polyhedrons (speculative geometric forms) materialized in concrete breakwaters (Les formes du repos series/The Forms of Rest). His work highlights the fact that the 'survival of forms' (Aby Warburg) takes place in today's world in functional and concrete environments. The artist acts with the curiosity of the Renaissance humanists in their studio (Studiolo, 2008), but he has adopted a thinking structure where dichotomies and the methodological boundaries of Art History are banned. With his typical transversal approach, the artist has started theoretical research into the urban practice that is skateboard by publishing essays and realizing artistic projects. In Riding modern art  (Lyon Biennale, 2007), he confronts photographs of the skaters performing on public sculptures with a sculpture by Katarzyna Kobro. The confrontation underlines that the movement is either of aesthetic potential for modern sculpture or a mechanical realization for skating. “It's almost an insult to the mysteries of the world to think that we could invent anything or that we needed to invent anything”; this quote by Borgès has become the artist's motto.Raphaël Zarka was born in 1957 in Montpellier, France.

Sharp y dessine une infinité de combinaisons possibles permettant de réaliser des polyèdres à partir d'un cube de bois - la figure la plus complexe permet de réaliser une forme parfaite de 120 facettes. Les études de Sharp ont donc abouti dans ce manuscrit, mais n'avait pas de fonction en soi. Sharp, comme l'artiste obsédé par ces formes pures, crée des objets esthétiques, des sculptures géométriques. En reproduisant les dessins de Sharp par un procédé de pyrogravure sur des poutres de chêne, Raphaël Zarka semble vouloir vérifier les théories du scientifique. Mais l'artiste s'arrêtera à mi-chemin, il donnera le tracé sur la forme brute au spectateur qui n'aura qu'un pas de plus à franchir pour obtenir un polyèdre parfait. Place à l'imagination ou peut-être au temps qui pourrait finir par suivre les tracés pour mieux fendre le bois.Contrairement à certaines oeuvres de Raphaël, il ne s'agit pas de réplique ou de reproduction mais plutôt d'une application, d'une réalisation qui, bien qu'incomplète, semble avoir fait naître quelque chose.Oeuvre à la fois énigmatique, discrète bien qu'imposante par sa taille, les deux photographies de l'ouvrage « Geometry Improved » peuvent compléter l'ensemble.L'oeuvre a été présentée à l'exposition \"L'anomalie d'Ararat\" à Châtillon-sur-Marne en 2008.

Proposant de recenser le mode de vie des Français, durant 12 épisodes de 26 minutes, un petit garçon et une petite fille sont d'abord interrogés à tour de rôle sur leur quotidien. Elargissant le champ de l'entretien, les interrogations de Godard et Miéville formulent progressivement un questionnement amenant les protagonistes à se penser en tant que sujet dans l'histoire du monde, à «se vivre et se voir à la télévision» avec un point de vue critique. Trente ans après Godard et Miéville, les deux artistes initient le projet d'une série de quatre épisodes intitulée France, détours et partent là où ils sont invités «interroger la France» afin de proposer une réflexion à partir de la question du vivre ensemble. Le premier épisode a été realize en 2009 à la Cité du Mirail, un grand ensemble conçu par l'architecte Candilis dans les années 1960 aux abords de Toulouse. Le second épisode (coproduit par la Fondation Kadist et la société de production L'âge d'or) se déroule en banlieue parisienne, à Pierrefitte, avec des collégiens décrocheurs et les responsables de l'AFPAD (Association pour la formation, la prévention et l'accès au droit).

Goldin and Senneby investigate an offshore company on the Bahamas called Headless Ltd whilst Barlow writes a docu-fictional murder-mystery, also called Headless, based on these investigations.

Ici, deux événements historiques sont confrontés, l'un datant de la fin des années 1930 et l'autre du début des années 1950. Dans l'un des espaces, vous vous trouvez face à la carte de la forêt de Marly où la société secrète « Acéphale», organisée autour de Georges Bataille, avait l'habitude de se réunir pour célébrer notamment le régicide de Louis XVI. Quelques années plus tard, Georges Bataille écrivait La Part maudite (1949). Dans cet essai, il décrit une société d'abondance dans laquelle pratiquer le potlatch et sacrifier l'excédent d'énergie et de richesses constituent les ressorts véritables de l'équilibre économique. Dans un second espace, vous êtes témoin de l'émergence de l'Eurodollar au début de la Guerre Froide, lorsque les banques soviétiques et chinoises déposaient leurs dollars en Europe, à la BCEN (EUROBANK), connue aujourd'hui comme la VTB Bank à Paris. Le dollar échappait alors à la juridiction territoriale et financière américaine, transformant la nature même de la monnaie qui passa d'une forme symbolique à une forme virtuelle. La monnaie entrait dans le nouvel espace de l'extériorité, échappant au contrôle d'un Etat souverain. La monnaie était décapitée. Ce sont là des faits. Des faits profondément entremêlés dans une fiction intitulée Looking for Headless, publiée par le duo d'artistes Goldin+Senneby. Dans ce roman policier, articulé autour d'un meurtre (par décapitation bien sûr), le narrateur part aux Bahamas à la recherche de la société offshore « Headless Ltd ». Pour écrire Looking for Headless, l'écrivain anonyme engagé par Goldin+Senneby, utilise des documents envoyés par les artistes  correspondances, dossiers, enregistrements  et décrit les différentes présentations artistiques du projet qui, depuis 2007, prend la forme de conférences, de lectures, de vidéos et d'expositions.Dans leur projet à Kadist Art Foundation, Goldin+Senneby soutiennent une hypothèse ténue mais très précise : l'émergence de l'Eurodollar, puis de la sphère financière offshore peut-elle constituer ce vide dans lequel la monnaie disparaît, réalisant cette même « consumation » des richesses évoquée par Bataille dans « La Part maudite » Et si cela est le cas, « Headless Ltd » peut-elle être l'incarnation contemporaine de la société secrète du même nom « Acéphale » ou s'agit-il d'une pure coïncidence Headless est un projet artistique omnivore, à plusieurs têtes, pour lequel les artistes Goldin+Senneby ont soustraité le développement à plusieurs personnages dans le roman, et à de véritables professionnels dans la réalité : un écrivain, un géographe économiste, une scénographe, un graphiste et même des institutions artistiques.",

L'histoire est à la fois continue et en rupture.

Elle utilise aussi un extrait du dernier film tourné sous le régime communiste. La scène se situe dans un endroit qui  a été complètement reconstruit depuis. Au début, le film lui-même a l'air d'être une reconstitution d'un ancien film d'Allemagne de l'Est, mais au fil de la projection, il s'agit plus d'une comparaison que d'une reconstruction.

    "artist_description": "Christoph Keller’s works function between science and art and have a practical as well as an aesthetic application. They are interventions into reality as well as inventions. Keller is fascinated by previous scientific undertakings such as Wilhelm Reich’s Cloudbuster project that Keller re-enacted from the roof of PS1 in an attempt to make rain over New York in the Spring and Summer of 2003 using orgone and nuclear energy. Keller’s stance is at once social political and artistic. He is engaged in debates around existence and the human condition. His project Helioflex is an attempt, using mirrors, to ‘bypass the social gradient of access to sunlight in urban habitations’, in other words to bring sunlight to areas normally in shadow at an affordable price. According to Keller the density of building generates a social gradient of sunlight in urban areas. The top floors bathe in light that is missing in the bottom floors. The device bypasses this gradient and creates a connection to the outside world by reflecting natural light to spaces that have never seen the sun before.’ Keller’s political engagement is in the tradition of Josef Beuys, who taught at the Free University in Berlin where Keller began to study physics in 1988. Christoph Keller is a German artist who studied math, physics and hydrology before studying liberal arts in Berlin. Christoph Keller was born in  Fribourg, Germany, in 1967.

Woodcut is her preferred medium.In her works she travels backwards in the history of image technologies, first by making videos or photographs that she transfers herself onto large-framed boards, then by carving and printing them. The topics depicted are often transport infrastructures (roads, tunnels, airports...) which evoke traveling, circulation in space, and also play a major role in armed conflicts; these urban landscapes in which concrete predominates, evince the alienation of the modern environment, the boredom of long journeys and embody the fanaticism for speed accompanying the development of transport in the contemporary era. Her motifs contrast with her use of a primitive handicraft. The slowness of this technique makes an ironic contrast with her subjects.Christiane Baumgartner's artistic approach thereby weaves a complex relationship to time, combining a return toward the past, a contemporary fascination for speed, and the deliberate choice of a painstaking technique.Christiane Baumgartner was born in Leipzig, Germany, in 1967.

Les images de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, vues avec des années de distance et dans la sûreté du foyer, sont devenues mythiques. Elles transmettent un héritage historique auquel les jeunes générations se sentent peu liées personnellement. Elles n'ont plus le pouvoir de choquer et sont entrées dans le champ de l'esthétique. [...]Les images que nous voyons au travers de l'écran de télévision sont esthétisées et leur signification est en quelque sorte neutralisée. [L'artiste] les désarme encore davantage par le biais de Photoshop et ensuite, en transposant l'image en xylogravure. L'image finale est bien loin de provoquer le sentiment ou l'expérience de la capacité destructrice des machines de guerre. »1\n\n1.

    "description": "In this photographic series, Yto Barrada was interested in the logos of the buses that travel between North Africa and Europe. They become like abstract paintings that recall Modernist formal experimentation. They are somehow symptomatic of the circulation of goods and people that is made to sound so abstract. The commentaries of two Moroccan children that accompany the images reminds us about the fact that everyday candidates to emigration try to spot these buses that will cross the Strait. Many children hide there and undertake long illicit journeys. As is often the case in her photographs, Yto Barrada chose a square format that conveys immobility despite the reference to transport. They are flat, without perspective, like the numerous walls visible in her work. The loss of depth in things ensures that any pain consciously stays separate from the beauty of the images.",

    "description": "This photograph is part of the series titled \"Iris Tingitana project\" (2007) focusing on the disappearance of the iris. If Yto Barrada was initially interested in the architectural heritage of the city, today the core of her research focuses on risks around landscape and its heritage. The iris, found bordering the city, carries the name of the city, and is an emblem of Tangier. This flower grows in the most improbable and resistant situations such as vacant land and construction sites. Now on roadsides, next to iris flowers grow geraniums, like in standardized European resorts. This photograph depicts a child proudly sporting a crown made of iris flowers in a deprived area. In traditional iconography, and especially in Catholic traditions, the iris, like the lily, is a royal symbol. This child reminds us of portraits from seventeenth century Dutch painting, in which flowers symbolize vanity. Despite the intense and interrogative look of the boy, one cannot help but think of the boy in a symbolized garden of Eden – a paradise lost.",

    "artist_description": "Trained as a biologist, Lempert's subjects are nature and its inhabitants while also being very influenced by the art of his time: seriality, archiving, abstraction, all-over painting. His approach to reality is empirical. At all times one is aware of his wonder and profound amazement with the world. He records traces, the natural geometries of the world, and thus defines his place between photography, drawing, abstraction and the object. His work in subtle. This is not to do with the definition of his images, but on the contrary with their absence of clarity, the choice made between the reality of the shot and the work in the lab. A double process occurs: what is captured and becoming in the presumed images is modified by the printing. There is some sort of loss, an incomplete image. The materiality of the paper plays a role in this approximate definition introducing a poor patina, entertaining the attitude of unlearning and starting again. Therefore the question can be posed differently: making visible something that is escaping, decomposing and going elsewhere.Jochen Lempert was born in Moers, Germany, in 1958. he lives and works in Hamburg.",

    "artist_description": "Bruno Serralongue integrates his practice into the processes of production and distribution of information via images. He attends very diverse events such as regional festivities (Les fêtes, 1994), the universal exhibition in Hanover (Expo 2000), a neoliberal meeting in Chiapas (Encuentro, Chiapas, 1996), with a rhythm which is different to that of a press photo-journalist. With no specific accreditation and by using a camera that requires very long exposures, his standpoint is of course different. The artist questions commissions and working methods – he then integrates these as modalities for producing  images by instatinga distance between the subject and the personal stylistic signature. According to his protocol for the Faits divers series (1993- 1995), the photographer works on very allusive information extracted from t miscellaneous news item section of the 'Nice-Matin' newspaper; Serralongue goes to the place mentioned two days after the event. As if emptied, the images create a space for representation that did not exist before. In the context of a crisis of representation and the scripting of reality by press images, “the document is a response to the world of images on the actual territory of the images, it is perhaps the only way to oppose the monopoly of spectacle”, according to Michel Poivert (in his analysis of the documentary style in \"La photographie contemporaine\",  2002), “the photographer and the spectator are reconciled by the adoption of the ordinary man's viewpoint”.",

    "description": "The half-length portrait of Joe Shirley presents a man with a great presence, wearing several items that point to ancestral Native American culture. In this photograph, which is relatively poor in information, the projection screen in the background acts as a clue about the event: Bruno Serralongue went to the second phase of the 'Sommet Mondial sur la Société de l’Information' (or SMSI, World Summit on Information Society, in Tunis in November 2005). This portrait echoes another picture in the same series (Native Peoples Claim Their Right to Participate in the Information Society) in which Joe Shirley is just a silhouette amongst the speakers, whereas here he occupies the entire frame. The strange impression that the model is posing for press photographers – and not for an artist making a portrait – reveals the staging of the event along the lines of the 'discourse of order' (Michel Foucault). In addition, the painting format introduces a different reading to that of a press photo. The artist questions the point of view and the space: “What distance should be adopted to face an event ? […] In my view, when using a different tool like a photographic chamber, there is necessarily a greater distance. […] In documentary photography, there is this idea of adjusting the distance, so that one cannot see too much or too little. One needs to find a distance within which the photographed person or event can 'speak'”.",

Le drapeau a eu une forte visibilité dans les médias, qui est aujourd'hui moindre.   L'artiste a éclairci le rouge jusqu'au rose et en a évidé le cercle central, questionnant ainsi le rôle de l'emblème comme signe de représentation d'un groupe. Ce geste interroge le pouvoir exercé par une symbolique politique actuelle, capable de fixer l'essence éphémère de la couleur pendant un instant historique qui peut durer des décennies ou des siècles. Eclaircir et découper, c'est en retrouver la complexité. « New Kurdish flag 01 » est aussi une réflexion sur le statut du drapeau: objet de propagande activé dans la rue lors de différentes performances, avant d'être muséifié dans un cadre en 2005, selon un glissement sémantique.

His works function as indices, in form, references or emotions, creating a very special atmosphere which reflects his interest in modernism that he defines as \"a total art that includes a real time.\" In Leblon's work, perception of space by the viewer is often precarious and ambiguous due to subtle alterations.

Lien) . La forme des briques avec un côté plus étroit correspondant au diamètre interne du puits, a été inventée sur ce site. Chez Guillaume Leblon, cette forme devient une réminiscence ; comme l'a développé Aby Warburg, les formes survivent et réapparaissent à travers les siècles et les lieux. L'oeuvre fait signe vers l'idée de puits dont elle mime la forme, tout en interrogeant la valeur d'usage cet objet par son caractère non fonctionnel : l'esquisse en terre crue ne résisterait pas à l'eau ; le trou abyssal est remplacé par un espace délimité avec les briques, auquel le spectateur peut se mesurer. Peut être le puits est-il la métaphore d'une ouverture de l'atelier vers le monde ?

Her work generally focuses on the video medium, though Segal claims not to be a video artist, rather as a scholar of phenomena, from the laws of math to those of awareness and consciousness. Her video installations incorporate playful tricks, diversions, or deceptions. Such is the case with Closed Circuit (2000), a work depicting a dancing woman hugging herself. Looking closer, images of the woman are shot from front and back and then projected from opposite sides of the room onto a sheet of glass, so that her two sides overlap, back turning into front, front turning into back. The effect is that the woman’s arms appear as if they encircle her own body. Another work, a more technically elaborate musing on illusion, Foreshadowing (2001), uses complex modeling software to create and operate a synthetic image of a spinning roulette wheel. Screened high above viewers’ heads, the wheel is intermittently overlaid by a seemingly random number, flashed so briefly as to be nearly subliminal, which none the less always reliably ‘predicts’ the winner. With each round the ostensibly chance-determined outcome of the game invariably fulfills the expectations of the tipped-off viewer.Miri Segal was born in Haifa, Israel, in 1965 and currently lives and works in Tel Aviv.",

The video explores the idea of masks we wear in SL and real life (“RL”), and the differences in communication within those two worlds. When somebody \"speaks,\" his or her avatar is seen typing, a mechanical ticking sound is heard, and words appear as text on the screen, strengthening the feeling that the conversation is taking place inside of our head. The video creates a new relation to the body and a new form of intimacy. We seem to engage this new form by chance, using the game's search engine Segal’s avatar sometimes appears with a Google search page as a mask, perhaps as a salute to another icon of cyber culture.

The city of Batman is a mid-sized Turkish city situated on the border with Irak.

Camera in hand, Atay makes short videos of everyday life. Despite the fact that they are direct and spontaneous, the images conserve an ambiguity, at times mysterious from a outsider's point of view.

    "description": "A cat, standing like a human being, is looking at us with round and dazed eyes and holds a gun. In the background, we notice a range of unwelcoming buildings, closed in with barbwire. A sentence is inscribed inside of one of the clouds, as if it were a speech bubble, and comments with hope or disillusion? : \" Ready to do something very bad\". We are left speechless and worried in front of this situation in which Alain Séchas projects us directly and spontaneously. With this installation combining a painting and a sculpture, we are given all the burden of reality to carry on our backs. With Séchas, things are clear: at first sight, it is a straightforward joke; in the end, it leads to awareness and a sharp comment on society.\"To me, art equals responsibility\". That is probably why Alain Séchas creates works according to the human scale, immediately evoking the human body. But rather than using the human figure, he chose that of the cat: a round-eyed feline which never smiles. \"Doing cats becomes like a trap, so that we identify a lot with it (...) and all the imagery of the cat reappears: the Egyptian cat, comics, caricature etc\". Chosen as our anthropological equivalent, the cat plays various characters, often provocative, and becomes the intermediary between the artist and the viewer. More than a mere sculpture, he is a drawing with volume, a motif which endlessly changes: \" I have always said that my work was about drawing; a small drawing is as important as a large sculpture and its making is as difficult for me. » Falsely naive, the work of Alain Séchas stands out and opens our eyes, like his cat: « Forcing the viewer to see is to me the very definition of art », he says. With no complacency whatsoever.\"Everyday in every way, I'm getting better and better\".",

Her practices blur fiction and history, often with humorous wit, theatrical sensibility, and allegorical impulse.

    "description": "Comprised of fifty-one photographic postcards, Antin’s 100 Boots is an epic visual narrative in which 100 black rubber boots stand in for a fictional “hero” making a “trip” from California to New York City. Over two-and-a-half years, Antin photographed the boots against different backdrops across the U.S., and then turned the pictures into postcards, which she then mailed to approximately 1,000 people around the world. In conjunction with the boots’ “arrival” in New York City, the postcards were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art. The project speaks not only to the reproduction and dissemination of images, but also about how the material reality of the images—their settings and their existence in mailboxes—was in stark contrast to the everyday lives of the people who received the cards. As with all “mail art” which had begun with the Fluxus movement in the late 1950s and was on the rise in the late 1960s, using the postal service enabled artists to completely bypass the traditional art-world distribution system, and allowed Antin to expand or compress time as the narrative required.",

    "artist_description": "Joe Scanlan became known in the 1990s due to his very particular appropriation of Conceptual art, exploiting two main registers: display on one hand, designating the artwork as a consumable product, DIY on the other, advocating the mobility and adaptability of objects, even their reversibility depending on contexts and usages. Scanlan's work turns out to be reversible. A shelf can appear to be a minimal construction and be used as a shelf, as implied by functional logic. The technical simplicity of Scanlan's realizations purposely leaning towards low-tech, with subsidiary possibilities for most of them to be de-installed and stored with no difficulty, convey something practical (art can be concretely useful) and aesthetic (each one of the artist's creations carries a specific function but also has its own plastic qualities) in the work. Thus Joe Scanlan's practice involves strategies that question the market and the value of a work of art. Extremely surprised by the attitude of students who are already wooed by galleries while they are still training, he invents Donnelle Woolford, a fictional artist he launches in the art world (with exhibitions, press articles, CV, facebook page, etc.). Beyond the conceptual aspect of his work, his approach focuses on the ephemeral nature of things, objects, lives. The artist's recent research, into the production of snowflakes or reconstituted forsythias, reveal his constant interest in what is transitory or ephemeral. This poetic tendency is becoming more and more present in Scanlan's work which always combines critical and independent standpoints.Joe Scanlan was born in 1961 in Stoutsville, Ohio. He lives and works in New York.",

    "description": "Travel drawing est une pièce montrée pour la première fois lors de son exposition personnelle à l'Institut d'art contemporain de Villeurbanne en 2007. Elle rend hommage au célèbre artiste conceptuel Sol Lewitt, qui mourut le 8 avril de la même année. À travers cette oeuvre, l'artiste souhaite rendre hommage à Sol Le Witt, et ainsi montrer au spectateur dans quelle mesure il est influencé par son travail et l'idée d'une conversion possible des idées en sculpture. Les tiges de forsythia, thème présent dans son travail depuis 7 ans, seront vues, au contact de Sol Lewitt, comme des dessins concrets où chaque tige est une ligne dans l'espace, et chaque fleur une marque. Reprenant le concept de mode d'emploi, où chez Sol LeWitt, l'oeuvre existe tout d'abord en tant qu'idée avant sa réalisation, le même principe est adopté pour Travail Drawing, où l'oeuvre existe d'abord en tant que boite nomade avant son installation. La manière dont les dessins sont exposés dans l'espace peut varier : à Villeurbanne, ils sont dispersés dans l'espace, lors de l'Armory show, les tiges sont toutes restées dans la boîte, à Amsterdam, cinq dessins seulement ont été créés avec les tiges, les autres étant restés dans la boîte. Ainsi Travel drawing est une image variable capable de se mouvoir d'un endroit à un autre et de réinventer son arrangement à chaque fois. Le motif du forsythia entre ainsi en résonance avec ce principe, c'est une fleur qui se renouvelle à l'infini dans le cycle des saisons : éternelles et toujours nouvelles.",

    "artist_description": "In the 1970s and 80s, the feature films Harun Farocki made contributed to theorizing essay-films, a cinema genre that juxtaposes archival images of different sources (news, film industry) with voiceover commentaries. More specifically it is a critical and political approach to the image that has characterized his oeuvre since the start, a point of view on the connections between war, technology and capitalism. In 1969, he makes one of his first films in 16mm called Inextinguishable Fire in which he appears as a TV presenter reading out the testimony of a Vietnamese victim of a Napalm attack. The subsequent images are like an educational documentary, an austere thesis on the origins of napalm production and the involvement of workers, students and engineers in what was largely used as a weapon against civilians. Years later, for the trilogy Eye/Machine (2001-2003), Farocki collects sequences filmed during the Gulf War, like images from projectiles, juxtaposed with images produced by machines made for surveillance, recognition and localization. The art historian Hal Foster describes Farocki's work like a genealogy of 'visual instrumentalization' following the evolution of image technologies and their roles in power struggles and the exercise of control. At the beginning of the 1990s he begins to imagine double projections that were presented in cinemas and soon in galleries and institutions that could easily adapt to this mode of projection. The evolution of the forms of presentation and distribution of his work explains his presence in various economies and most recently that of the art market.Harun Farocki was born in 1944 in Neutitschein, Czech Republic. He lives and works in Berlin.",

    "description": "For Immersion, Harun Farocki went to visit a research centre near Seattle specialized in the development of virtual realities and computer simulations. One of their projects consists in using virtual reality (environments created to simulate this world) for therapeutic reasons for soldiers suffering traumas after the Iraq war. The double projection creates a parallel between animations and testimonies by soldiers reliving their mission, the explosions, gunshots and ambushes, their fears and their guilt. The chosen direct rendering and simplicity of the edit places us like the voyeur of a personal and difficult experience. The end is disconcerting since the last soldier, who one minute had been pleading his therapist to stop the program, looks at his audience and smiles with a detachment that sheds doubt on the authenticity of his account. The Virtual Iraq program is closer to a virtual game than a therapeutic program. Immersion continues to explore the impact of new technologies on society, the relations between virtual reality and the military world and how the scenarios developed as\nvideo games are used as training tools as much as a therapy.",

Jennifer Allen writes in artforum (Summer 2005): “Surfaces can serve blindness and vision: images, decoration and destiny. While linking clairvoyants, psychologists, and art critics as interpreters, Amorales also levels the hierarchy between artists, whose creations are generally treated as singular, and actors and musicians, who often interpret works that have already been produced or performed by others. In the era of postproduction – where images tend to be ready-made – the artist is simply a point of distribution, not the origin of images.”An edition exists in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.",

Not in the sense of plausible but fake alternative histories or but rather, hers are theatrical renderings in film, performance, painting or sculpture. The cultivation of illusion and ambiguity, as a counter to the concrete veracity of factual things, is one of Mathilde Rosier’s persistent concerns. The artworks that result seem decidedly uncontemporary; without attempting to be nostalgic per se, they appear out of our time or quaint. Pastel-colored watercolors of birds attached to hats, melodic musical scores, videos permeated with the haze of twilight: the artist would tell you that her art sits at the limit of the “acceptable,” as it is at times too charmingly pretty and too apparently inoffensive to fit in an art world that often privileges other qualities. But behind the apparent naivety of her fantastical world is a force that deceives or, indeed, that makes deception the very thread that binds her work together.Mathilde Rosier was born in 1973 in Paris and currently lives and works in Burgundy and Berlin.",

In the film, a pensive and reflective man is depicted playing guitar at sea as well as from inside a boat looking outward. Airy and divine-like, he is shown sleeping, in a trance state, staring out to the ocean, waiting for the journey to pass, progress, in order to arrive somewhere, but where? There is mention of Recife, Brazil, but one gets the sense that figure and place is almost other-worldly or mythic. This is further highlighted by the repetitious sound of the ocean’s waves. The ending of the film is quite arbitrary, expressing a clear desire to not illustrate an end or a narrative, but another kind of vacant agency close to immediacy and the present.",

His photographs, stories, videos, and installations are driven by the internecine war and political-religious agitation in Northern Ireland between the nationalist community predominantly Catholic and the unionist Protestant majority that has occurred since the late 60's. The city and public space are the scene of civil conflicts. In the video \"Three Potential Endings\" (2008) political space is allegorized in the architecture. The work of Doherty transforms these \"non-places\" into sets. In \"Grey Day IX\" (2007), the idea of ​​borders, understood as a separation is less cernable and more diffuse. Daily and anonymous violence in an intolerant public space is denounced. His images raise the question of the representation of political confrontation, through the use of codes in art and cinema, and by means of image and text.

Since the discovery of Jean tinguely’s retrospective at the Tate Gallery in London, in 1982, Michael Landy spent two years researching and sketching (charcoal, oil, glue, ink) from his previous research carried out  at Museum Tinguely in Basel, and at the MOMA in New York. By labor intensive work,  Michael Landy tried to recapture the essence of the event, to dislocate and to revive it with these the black and white drawings. He made them on several scales, some very small, some medium format and some, like this, large scale. Made with oil stick or white glue or both, he played on the idea of mezzotint as well as the idea of night time performance. The images are based on the film made of Tinguely's action. Some drawings are made as though within the machine, and others, like this one, are made as though observing the machine from a distance. In certain drawings the machine is self-destructing, in others it is complete. Skeleton of the Dump shows the machine in lonely isolation, almost an outsider and rather forlorn.

His work initiates with a simple action, either by him or others, which is then documented in a range of media. Alÿs explores subjects such as modernizing programs in Latin America and border zones in areas of conflict, often asking about the relevance of poetic acts in politicized situations. Documentation is central to his practice as well as painting, drawing, and video. In his work, When Faith Moves Mountains (2002) made in collaboration with Mexican critic Cuauhtemoc Medina, Alÿs recruited 500 volunteers outside of Lima, Peru. Each person moved a shovel full of sand one step at a time form one side of a dune to the other, and together they moved the entire geographical location of the dune by a few inches. Critic Jean Fisher linked Alÿs’ work to the radical event of precipitating a crisis of meaning, where the exposure of a void of meaning is confronted by its social situation, leading up to some kind of truth.

    "description": "The Nightwatch, which is an ironic reference to the celebrated painting by Rembrandt, follows the course of a fox wandering among the celebrated collections of the National Portrait Gallery in London. The path of the fox, from galleries containing 16th, 17th and 18th century portraits of historic figures from British history hung on plush walls, is circuitous and seemingly random.The fox tracks back and forth, sometimes inspecting the gallery furniture, often walking through the middle of the room but sometimes around its perimeter until eventually it climbs on top of a showcase, covered in fabric where he settles down to sleep. The actions of the fox are observed from the close-circuit television cameras which form part of the museum's security system. Foxes are now commonly found in London roaming the suburban streets at night-time. They are in a sense flaneurs sauvages. The insertion of a fox in such an august institution is at once bizarre and yet in some sense perfectly normal. There is a constant tension in the film: will the fox do some damage, what attracts him to particualr places that he returns to; how does he decide where he will settle. The fox acculturises to the gallery in the same way he has become acclimatised to the city. The fox is an outsider, an interloper banned from the city that has re-inserted itself. Alys draws a parallel between the fox and himself. 'No matter how long I have been away, I have one foot in a European culture, and one foot out… A lot of my work has played on the double status'. The theme of surveillance is multi-layered. On the one hand the fox is staking out the gallery; the portraits on the wall appear to be watching him; the security cameras are monitoring both the paintings and the fox and finally, we the viewer are observing the whole action.",

The artist reveals meaning through displacements, changes of state such as the physical occurrence of sublimation (matter transforming from solid to gas). In Ecran (Screen, 2008), the weave of a projection screen is blown-up full-scale and takes over the entire room. Evariste Richer makes visible these micro perforations which are usually hidden by the film being projected; he reveals the infra small and ghostly. Blow up (2003), a tennis ball which has been turned in on itself, could stand as an allegory for sedimentation and concatenation. The concentration of meaning and gesture produces the artwork. The constant shifting between the cosmic and the infra small brings together knowledge and observation, certainties and the poetry of art. A piece from a meteorite can become a dice (Médéorite,  2008), a dice turning at high speed can become an illustration of the energy principle (Le grêlon noir/The Black Hailstone, 2008). Crystallisation – which was defined by Stendhal as feelings born in the imagination that become attached to an object to transfigure it – is the base of Richer's work.

L'oeuvre joue avec le hasard, à chaque exposition le montage produit une combinaison visuelle renouvelée. Robert Filliou dira qu'Eins. Un. One... (16000 dés répandus au sol, 1984) « peut se concrétiser, se concrétise et se concrétisera sans limite dans les formes et les combinaisons de formes les plus erses ».La sculpture de Richer fonctionne comme une image encodée et pixélisée de l'inidu selon différentes strates de significations : le poids de l'oeuvre correspond au poids moyen d'un homme adulte (76kg) ; les couleurs des dés rappellent celles utilisées dans les schémas représentant de manière codifiée l'Adn humain ; chaque choix que l'homme doit formuler pourrait être pensé comme un coup de dé. Le titre de la sculpture fait référence à un nuage qui provoque des chutes de grêle et des orages très destructeurs. La sculpture est aussi fragile et menaçante que ce phénomène météo, la dislocation et l'explosion menacent. Dans son travail l'artiste associe dés, grêlons, météorite.Différents niveaux de sens (l'homme, le climat, le jeu) sont cristallisés dans cette oeuvre selon la logique de la concaténation formant un tout. L'artiste associe inidu et atmosphère, le microcosme et le macrocosme, dans une parenté d'esprit avec le sociologue Edgar Morin qui développe la notion de complexité (au sens étymologique « ce qui est tissé ensemble »), comme un enchevêtrement d'entrelacements.",

    "artist_description": "Jason Dodge extracts objects from everyday life – of which he adds minimal alterations by  the way that he isolates and presents them. For instance, he collects all the light sources of a house in \"Darkness falls on Wolkowyja Poland\" (2005), he samples the strings of a violin in \"The viola duo of Bela Bartok\" (2007), he records on a light sensitive photo paper in \"Into Black\" (2007), and finally he adds a bell brush chimney sweep in \"Ringing Through chimneys\" (2007). The artist goes beyond the silent dimension of the object to reveal their narrative potential, triggering fiction. The artist considers them as elements of a broader context. \"I ​​try to consider my work related to writing, but using a visual language,\" says the Dodge. Name placards accompanying works are pretexts for further stories, supplemented by the imagination of the viewer and their inquiries. The artist, as a storyteller, reintroduces stories, the spoken word, and language in the space of the white cube. In Dodge's work, the readable is not reducible to the visible. It operates like a trompe l'oeil, an image that gives the illusion of distance from reality, yet is blurred by the poetry of the intervention of the artist.  Jason Dodge was born in 1969 in Newton, Pennsylvania, USA.

Les nuances de couleurs et de textures renvoient à de multiples sensations visuelles et sensitives, évoquant un ciel de couleur nuit. C'est par sa concentration dans le tissage que la distance peut être représentée de manière concrète et visible en un seul regard. Décrire l'oeuvre équivaut à produire un récit qui fait écho aux mythes qui entourent le procédé du tissage.

Forming a continuous loop, it shows a this entropic trip as an endless destructive cycle, just like the image of the Ouroboros, \"snake eating its tail\" , which exists in many world mythologies and which is, at the same time, a symbol autophagous self-destruction and of renewal.",

    "description": "Invited in 2007 to the Museum Folkwang in Essen (Germany), Simon Starling questioned its history: known for its collections and particularly for its early engagement in favor of modern art (including the acquisition and exhibition of works by Cézanne, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Matisse), then destroyed during the Second World War, the museum was pillaged for its masterpieces of 'degenerate art' by the nazis. Starling found photographs of a hang dating back to 1929, taken by Albert Renger-Patzsch, the German New Objectivity photographer. Firstly, he researched the artworks that were presented then which for the most part had been restituted or acquired by private collectors after the war. Secondly, he reconstituted this hang. Finally, he took the same pictures as Renger-Patzsch, with the same 'scientific objectivity'. The result is simple and minimal, and tends to erase any difference with the original. Playing on the notion of author, Starling identically reconstructs ('Nachbau' means reconstruction in German), thus he realizes an exact replica of the photographs taken seventy years earlier. By blurring temporalities, the artist manipulates the history of the collections and questions the outcome of the images and the institution in light of this actual reconstruction in the museum. This work can also be understood as an absurd attempt to go back in time in order to correct history.",

His coat hid over 15 000 different prints. In Aurélien Froment's work, a magician presents images by making them appear, disappear or move in space. The performance is accompanied by a rather rudimentary sounding music that highlights the artifice of the magician's tricks and places the whole in a comedic register. He also manipulates the images himself and creates associations which seem to spell out a meaning. It can also appear as a metaphor for artistic creation, ideas that coincide, hesitations and experiments that constitute a practice. Inevitably one also ends up making connections between art and magic, the artist and the magician, artistic technique with that of illusion. In this work, Aurélien Froment questions modes of representation pursued in the publication Théâtre de poche (volume 1) in which he interviews different people (an architect, someone working in advertising and a creator of puzzles) who manipulate images daily in their jobs.",

The previous work took the form of four photographs presenting a page illustrated with three images. By studying these with more attention, it is possible to figure out that these objects were placed behind the pierced card with three openings. Recourse to the photograph had given the impression of flatness. In this photo, he reveals his tricks in a burlesque manner by using a copy of this visual tool enlarged to the extent that the handling becomes difficult. He is interested in reenacting or requesting the reenactment of works he has already made in order to create narrative in perpetual evolution. Here the absence of images refers to the autonomy of images that can leave their frame and presentation mode, physically and symbolically. As in Théâtre de Poche, this work is the result of a performance. It could be considered a self-portrait of the artist confronted with the tools of his trade. Here one finds many of Froment's obsessions: the relation between the plane and perspective, questions of viewpoints and positioning with a distinct bodily presence, the modes of circulation of images. The title refers to the rotation of letters. This series was realized during a trip to San Francisco.",

Ce n'est pas n'importe quel objet mais une sculpture iconique de la fin du 20ème siècle, le Bunny de Jeff Koons. S'il est question de construction des images, il est aussi question de sculpture, du passage de la bidimensionnalité à la tridimensionnalité. L'intérêt pour l'image en mouvement, avant tout théorique, est aussi une réflexion sur la construction matérielle des images. Il refait pour ce film la sculpture de Koons pour se donner la possibilité de l'expérimenter par lui-même dans son atelier. Dans beaucoup de ses vidéos, on peut discerner les contours de son atelier et parfois sa propre présence. En référence à Marcel Duchamp, il souhaite  créer une ultime Machine Célibataire, ne produisant rien d'autre qu'elle-même en référence à l'autoréflexivité du Pop. Le Bunny est une forme sculpturale dans l'espace mais produit également des images. Il est évident que nous sommes dans une image totalement construite car il est impossible de filmer l'objet sans avoir, à un moment ou un autre, le reflet de la caméra sur la surface en acier. Mark Leckey est intéressé par les possibilités que permettent les nouvelles technologies et met également au coeur de son travail la révélation d'un monde sensible et quasi magique.

We can recall the exhibition 'Night Shift' at the Palais de Tokyo ( Paris) in 2002 where the works could be seen only from the angle of the sun, exploring the relationship between day, night, and other natural cycles like the sun and moon, life and death. But in 9'oclock (my time is not your time), time becomes a pattern. The artist manipulates the number nine by printing it on three stacked glass plates. Depending on the position and the viewer's eye, the shape evolves to deconstruct the meaning completely. This work is characteristic of artist's practice in the way in which he borrows 70s design (in the refinement of its production, its appearance, and color), and the issue of perception, of deconstruction, and transformation.",

In this particular film, Djurberg deals with a theme that is becoming all too common in our lives, caring for an elderly, infirm parent. The film suggests not only the degradation of the demented mother, covered with bed sores, but her daughter’s effort to care for her that ultimately leads to her death at the hands of the mother: the burden of looking after her literally crushes her to death.\nLike all of Djurberg’s work, the film is very painterly, bridging the gap between film, sculpture and painting. She has stated that the writings of Georges Bataille, that she encountered as a student, made an impact on her, as the scatological and anxious nature of her work attests. Ironic, humorous, terrifying, cruel and tender, Once Removed…, is typical of Djurberg’s animalistic vision.",

    "description": "The video Make down is a 34 minute sequence shot that shows the artist removing make-up in front of a mirror. The peculiarity of the scene consists in two symbolic details: first, the make-up itself, covering his face, hair and torso - a thick kaki layer, reminding of military camouflage - and second, the paper used to remove the make-up - black and white prints of stills taken from Gillo Pontecorvo's 1965 film, \"La bataille d'Alger\"( The Battle of Algiers). These still images put together recreate a sequence in which a young Algerian woman takes off her veil and puts on Western make-up. This disguise will help her pass the border and place a bomb in the French area of Algiers. Censured in France when it came out, the movie combines history and feminist activism; it may also be reinterpreted today in relation to the recent history of terrorism. The video goes with an installation: a vitrine enclosing the 96 prints soiled by the make-up, the remains of the artist's performance, as if it were a reliquary. Compared to the terrorist's gesture, the action is performed backwards by the artist, which could suggest the impossibility of having a unique reading of history.",

The artist was only able to identify the objects after developing and enlarging the prints: you can read “He's no terrorist”. The front page of the newspaper thrusts back to 'the event' of the 21st century and is revealed only through the detailed observation of the image; the painful twist of the newspaper could be a rustling wing. The simplicity of the process gives the work a poetic and prophetic dimension: a slight debris of a society, suspended between the sky and the earth in a blue infinite, sad news taken elsewhere, pieces of paper disintegrating. Violence, fracas and horror are audible in the silence of the image. These debris are transfigured into the silence of the victims flying towards a blue eternity. The artist pays a modest and painful homage. There is no taking sides, no judgment, just a flight in the sky. Dennis Adams sounds out collective memory, the public sphere, the urban context in their relations to art.",

    "artist_description": "In most of his work Artur Zmijewski uses the same tested method: he devises a scenario, sets up a situation, and introduces a group of individuals to participate and experiment with how they react. He films them and rarely takes part in the act himself. The other half of his work consists in editing the material. Through editing, Zmijewski sets up his argument, emphasizes important moments, and conjures, more than often, a highly emotive plot, which leaves the films looking like self-directed documentaries. An inseparable part of this strategy is exposing the project’s participants to the experience of emotion, where more than often he is personally involved. The nature of his work, an inseparable connection to documentation and the truth of human emotions, betrays the syndrome of disbelief in representation, depiction, and mediated expression. The artist belongs to a generation of Polish artists who in the 1990s experienced the transformation of their world, a transformation that language failed to keep pace with. The exhaustion of language, the wearing away of public discourse, is doubtless a measure of the crisis of social communication. The strangeness of the seemingly familiar body is also one of Zmijewski’s major themes. It can be literal and occur in prosaic circumstances stripped of any surrealist marvel. And yet it has explosive force and political effects.Artur Zmijewski was born in 1966 in Warsaw. he lives and works in Warsaw, Poland.",

    "description": "Zeppelintribüne (2002) was shot near the Zepelintribune in Nuremberg, designed by Albert Speer, chief architect of the Third Reich. The 360-metre-long structure is part of a larger architectural complex called the Zeppelinfeld, which the National Socialist used for their marches and rallies. The Zeppelintribune was immortalized in the Leni Reifenstahl’s film-propaganda masterpiece the Triumph of the Will, a record of a 1934 Nazi Party rally. The Zeppeltribune was destroyed by degrees, beginning as early as 1945, when the Americans, who held a victory parade there, blew up a large swastika on the roof. In the 60s, the columns and side-reinforcement were removed, further stripping the ruin of embarrassing architectural allusions to the past. Zmijewski thought of it as a place of pilgrimage for tourists, also as a neglected and dirty place in Germany. In this work, he alludes to how the nation inadvertently works in solidarity to destroy the past. The film features fragments of fascist newsreels from the 1930s, mixed with Zmijewski’s own footage of a pair of Turkish artists in residence in Germany, dubbed the Arbeitsmänner (“workmen”).  Shovel in hand, the artists parade around with spades in front of the tribune, parodying the military drill ritual leaving us with a film about impersonation and memory, memory so perverse that it persuades tourists to raise their hand in the gesture of the Nazi salute.",

    "artist_description": "Marked by an apparent austerity and meticulousness, Pascal Grandmaison’s works display a disconcerting aloofness from the world, a clearly asserted detachment from reality. The subjects that interest the artist primarily deal with the means by which humans try to grasp their world, both visually and intellectually. The artist employs photography, video, and sculpture in order to compose a vision of what some have termed “troubling strangeness.” Overturning conventional codes of visual analysis, Grandmaison focuses on inanimate subjects that, once disassociated from their familiar environment, are re-contextualized through his cold gaze. His depictions do not exist as stories instead he reverses viewpoints and inverts color codes. His photographs and video works are generally black and white, giving them a monotone feel. A constant visual repetition in his work is his rigorously impersonal gaze. As a keen observer, he meticulously scrutinizes the world around him, analyzing it through the lens of a camera. Grandmaison is interested in the appearance of things and non-beings and, more rarely, of beings themselves. When human figures do appear in his work, they are presented in an inexpressive, impassive, distant way, equated to the role of an object.Pascal Grandmaison was born in Montreal, Canada, in 1975.",

    "description": "Solo (2003) is a video exhibited as a video/sound installation depicting shots of drum, voice, guitar, clavier/synthesizer, and a melodica player cut into segmented fragments from the perspective of a studio recording set. Rather than deploying a narrative strategy, Grandmaison focuses on the gestures of the musicians and the repetitions they carry out when recording their individual tracks. The musicians are portrayed nodding, dancing, improvising, strumming, creating resonance that is repeated over and over– however, Grandmaison is sure not to document their entire faces or expressions while they perform, just details. Similar to that of a “jam,” close attention is granted to the exertion of the camera and how it portrays the framing of sequences. What one can pick up from the segments, especially those of voice recording, is a modified reworking of Anne Clark’s 1980’s track “Sleeper in the Metropolis.”",

Quel est le statut de ce O, adossé aux cimaises du white cube ? Monk nous en donne quelques pistes. Le O est une initiale, la lettre reprend la première lettre d'Owen.

Comme dans certaines oeuvres de Mario Garcia Torres (The Transparencies of the Non-act, diaporama sur l'artiste Oscar Neuestern, dans la collection Kadist), l'artiste prête son discours à un inconnu.   Par une maitrise du montage, il intercale un monologue et des images. Une suite d'extraits, qui entrecoupent son discours, montrent la récurrence du thème au cinéma : depuis René Clair  avec « Paris qui dort » (1924), jusqu'à « The Last Men on Earth » (1964) ou « The Omega Man » (1971). Ces thèmes sont récurrents dans la culture littéraire et cinématographique et dans l'imaginaire européen ; « nous avions ce rêve avant, le rêve que nous étions seul ».Ils se sont beaucoup développés dans les années 1960-1970, permettant ainsi d'exprimer les inquiétudes de l'époque (bombe atomique d'Hiroshima, menaces de la Guerre Froide) à travers la fiction.      Dès le début de la vidéo, on aperçoit Paris, puis d'autres villes, vides, immeubles, routes et monuments abandonnés. Plus qu'une filmographie sur la fin du monde, le narrateur nous explique que cette obsession est liée aux choses : « Je regardais ces films pour leurs objets, leur accumulation massive d'objets »  Que deviendront ces objets, ces voitures, ces maisons lorsqu'ils auront perdu leurs utilisateurs ? Toujours selon le narrateur, ces objets ont justement une autre fonction, une autre  identité, « une vie secrète ».  « L'histoire du futur est donc notre présent », finit-il par avouer ; ces films annonciateurs sont, avant tout, les témoins de notre histoire.",

    "description": "Le travail de Dora Garcia est issu de la critique institutionnelle (critique du musée, de ses codes et des formats proposés) et plus généralement de celle du langage, à la suite des artistes conceptuels des années 60 (Weiner, Kosuth) mais aussi d'Andrea Fraser (années 80-90). L'oeuvre What a fucking wonderful audience (2008) se positionne idéalement à la croisée de plusieurs tendances identifiables dans le travail de l'artiste. La performance dont elle est issue, mise en oeuvre à la Biennale de Sydney 2008, prend la forme d'une visite guidée, au musée d'art moderne de Sydney, autour d'oeuvres qui n'y sont pas présentées physiquement. Le performeur se présente comme un guide de musée traditionnel et offre aux visiteurs une « visite/ discours » qui commente plusieurs oeuvres issues de l'histoire de l'art ou du cinéma qui ont voulu bousculer le spectateur (« Cosmococa » de Oiticica, « Kunst Kick » de Chris Burden, « La société du spectacle » de Guy Debord). À travers ce « commentaire composé », Dora Garcia tisse la trame d'une filiation entre elle et différents auteurs dont la démarche visait à questionner les places assignées au spectateur et à l'artiste au sein de l'institution. Les cartons annotés et encadrés qui constituent physiquement l'oeuvre sont les cartons originaux utilisés pour la performance à Sydney. Le texte imprimé contenant le commentaire des oeuvres a été entièrement écrit par Dora Garcia, tandis que les annotations sont de la main du performeur, qui est venu préciser ou contredire le discours de l'artiste et s'en est servi pour sa prétendue visite guidée. La photographie encadrée documente la performance. Présentée au sein de l'exposition personnelle de l'artiste à la galerie Michel Rein, Paris,  cette oeuvre présente un moment important de la démarche de l'artiste : une trace de la performance dans laquelle cohabitent la patte de l'artiste et celle du performeur. Cet aspect est essentiel au travail de l'artiste puisqu'elle ne réalise jamais elle-même ses performances mais commissionne toujours des acteurs professionnels. Elle est donc elle-même dans un rapport distant au spectateur, qui lui permet de mieux manipuler le rapport entre le performeur et le public. Le rapport de pouvoir qu'elle met ainsi en place se joue de ceux qui existent dans l'institution. En rejouant une prétendue visite guidée au sein d'une biennale d'art contemporain, Dora Garcia vient interroger les codes de l'art contemporain. Cette performance rejoint ainsi des projets antérieurs comme The Beggar's Opera, présenté au Skulptur Projekte de Münster pour laquelle l'artiste déjouait l'attente des visiteurs du grand événement d'art public. Tandis que ceux-ci s'acharnaient à chercher la sculpture de Dora Garcia, celle-ci avait introduit dans la ville un comédien jouant le rôle d'un mendiant et racontant ses aventures sur un blog. Une oeuvre quasi-invisible, comme une bonne partie du travail de Dora Garcia.",

    "artist_description": "Allan McCollum neither superimposes the conditions of industrial production as artistic practice nor attempts to raise them, in a heroic gesture, to the status of high art. The starting point of his art generally surrounds the idea of a sign. He frames the sign inside of realm of the significant characteristics of the total quantity of all pictures in general. These considerations are the result of an inconsistency of art production in relation to culture at large and the function it fulfills. This function is determined by the fact that in the economic system of a consumer society, the artwork becomes a commodity.", 
    "artist_name": "Allan Mccollum", 
    "description": "In the work titled The Glossies (1980), an affinity for photography manifested itself before McCollum actually began to use photography as a medium. The Glossies are drawings, rectangular forms applied with blank ink and watercolors, which fill up the sheets parallel to the edges except for a small margin. Finally, the whole paper is covered with an adhesive plastic laminate, which gives it the shiny surface of a photograph. The drawing as original artistic expression is employed as a sign for photography. In this respect, The Glossies marks a decisive transition to the “Plaster Surrogates”, a multi-phase work, which McCollum began to create in 1982. Discussing the Plaster Surrogates in a 1985 interview, McCollum described his practice as “a sort of ‘working to rule’”: a job action in which workers do precisely and only what is required contractually, both refusing excess work and excessively observing rules and regulations. “In a sense, I’m doing just the minimum that is required of an artist and no more.” Each and every Surrogate is signed dated and numbered. Although McCollum works with assistants, he insists on painting the outer edge of every black center and the inner edge of every border. No two surrogates are identical; all those of the same dimensions have slightly different colored borders and vice versa. There is nothing false about the objects themselves. McCollum doesn’t employ illusionism or trompe l’oeil. His Surrogates aren’t forgeries of paintings. They’re not even paintings – only plaster objects, which may, at a distance, resemble framed images. The artist proceeded to hang his Surrogate Paintings in larger groups and in a relatively order less way, side by side and one beneath the other. By his increase of quantity and the effect of repetition, he intended likewise to interpret this exaggerated idea of an installation as a sign and to exclude any kind of view, which emphasizes the importance of the single picture. The surrogates, via their reduced attributes and their relentless sameness, started working to render the gallery into a quasi-theatrical space which seemed to “stand for” a gallery; and by extension, this rendered the artist into a caricature of the artist, the viewers performers.",

    "artist_description": "The work of Keith Tyson is concerned with an interest in generative systems, and embraces the complexity and interconnectedness of existence. Philosophical problems such as the nature of causality, the roles of probability and design in human experience, and the limits and possibilities of human knowledge, animate much of his work.  Language as a coded system, as a representation medium, but also as something that generates a whole variety of realities also plays a central role. The heterotopias of the real and imagined, near and far, thinkable and inconceivable converge and find meaning. Using phrases, along with a list of them that could be continued ad infinitum, Keith Tyson creates images that cause the distant and the near, the fictitious and the real to operate from within a location. His media include painting, drawing and installation. His exhibits are hybrid forms, they are games, images, machines, mechanisms that offer places from which literature, inventories, phenomena spread out into spheres that are infinite in both space and time. In Tyson’s work the idea of dimensions play out in terms of prolongation of time and space, and the idea of breadth and compression. Tyson is not so much concerned with representation rather he is interested in subject of machines, mechanisms and engines that confront our models for handling reality and the re-evaluation of our subjective positions.

Researching instances of repetitions in found media, she combines them to reveal new meanings, sometimes using a structure related to other forms of artistic expression. McAlpine looks at the ways in which we process and absorb film as well as transforming extracts into rather painterly images. She examines the way in which cinema acts upon the mind making the subliminal liminal. All her films explore issues related to time (real and film), editing, continuity and rupture. McAlpine's work reflects the mediated world in which we live and looks at ways in which our cultural constructs are based on repetition and similarities.Elizabeth McAlpine was born in London in 1973.

    "description": "Le travail d'Elizabeth McAlpine est souvent lié à la question du temps et à l'expérience du regard. Dans « The Height of the Campanile », l'artiste a calculé la durée de son film en fonction de la hauteur de son sujet, le Campanile, de sorte qu'au final la longueur de la pellicule soit équivalente à celle de la tour. De même, le temps nécessaire pour visionner le film et le rythme du travelling effectué par la caméra correspondent. Ainsi, tandis que nombre des oeuvres de McAlpine sont basées sur le montage, la répétition et la fragmentation, « 98m » se présente comme un simple plan-séquence.L'image, au grain apparent, est projetée au mur à la taille d'une carte postale, pendant que le film forme une boucle au sein d'une structure en verre pensée par l'artiste. La taille de la projection rappelle que Venise est devenue une destination touristique incontournable. L'utilisation du Super 8 est une évocation de la pratique amateur - précédant l'invention de la vidéo, du touriste fixant le souvenir de ses vacances pour le projeter une fois rentré à la maison. Si ce support procure à l'oeuvre un caractère daté, la boucle continue et hypnotique formée par la pellicule suggère au contraire une certaine intemporalité, semblable à celle que peut ressentir le touriste qui découvre San Marco.",

    "artist_description": "The films of Lars Laumann incorporate codes of documentary, grappling with topics at the limits of fiction. This process of fictional documentary recalls the practices some artists in the Kadist collection like Omer Fast, Joachim Koester, John Menick, Akram Zaatari, Arthur Zmijewski. In 2007, Matthew Higgs presented, at White Columns Gallery (New York), Laumann's first film, \"Morrissey Foretelling the Death of Diana\" which claims that the Smiths album \"Queen is Dead\" produced in 1986, announces the death of Princess Diana in 1997 in Paris. Illustrated in a film montage, the narrator's discourse draws parallels between the surprising words belonging to pop culture and events that occurred years later. Lars Laumann's analysis takes as a starting point the iconic figure of Diana, and develops a \"conspiracy theory\" by claiming extraterrestrial involvement in those events, thus offering a vision of a world entirely controlled. Lars Laumann was born in 1975 in Brønnøysund, Norway. He lives and works in Berlin.",

    "description": "Eija Riitta was born in 1954 in Liden, Sweden, and is \"objectum-sexual.\" Since June 17, 1979, her name is Eija Riitta Berliner Mauer taking the name of her husband, the Berlin Wall. In animism all elements of nature are considered as alive and have souls.  \"Objectum-sexuality\" is an extension of this belief. Eija's blog explains the situation perfectly – her attraction to rectangular parallel lines, constructions such as bridges, fences or the Berlin Wall. Furthermore, this can be witnessed at her house, now the \"Museum of models and guillotines,\" a subject that she is equally passionate about. More than a documentary on the subject, Lars Laumann filmed the encounter between two lovers of the Berlin Wall. In the video, we come to realize that the first woman married the wall before the war, clinging to the memory of what it was, while the second fell in love with the Berlin Wall after its destruction. Surprisingly, these women do not consider the wall as a symbol of political history, but more as an independent object of history. The first woman fell love with the wall for its lines, its strength, its breadth, while the other for its colors, its fragmentation, and its fragility. In presenting this film in an artistic context, Laumann makes a surprising parallel between \"objectum-sexuality\" and art. To contemplate a work for its formal aspects, refers to Eija's speech which considers the Berlin Wall as a free being, without any responsibility of which he is charged. Thus, the destruction of the wall, as Eija claims, is as an act of barbarism, of an innocent person.",

    "artist_description": "Based on photographs and domestic environments, Schoorel’s paintings are charged with an atmosphere of melancholy and loss. In her paintings images emerge slowly. Her figurative paintings appear faded or bleached with brush strokes that suggest outlines and restrained marks that imply areas of colour or shadow. The viewer must participate in the paintings, employing a particular way of looking that allows the images to unravel slowly over time. The spaces they provide are not only physical, but also conceptual – the freedom to find pleasure in their beauty, or to find consolation in the way in which they transform memory from an image of yesterday into a fresh, present-day experience.Maaike Schoorel was born in 1973 in Santpoort, The Netherlands.

    "artist_name": "Maaike Schoorel", 
    "description": "This is one of the most important works Schoorel has made to date, a triptych that has as its subject matter a garden scene with what looks like a pond. One of her largest works, it seems highly suited to a Parisian collection where Monet’s Nympheas in the Orangerie represent the summit of treatments of such subjects. Typically for Schoorel, the painting is as much about absence as presence and examines the amount of information the viewer needs to construct meaning. Delicate stains and touches of paint describe the subject which is contingent and evanescent. These are paintings that require slow readings, allowing the eye to adjust and to assemble information. Time is an important theme in the work; not simply the time it takes to decipher it but time associated with memory, a faculty the painting appears to emblematize. Like all Schoorel’s work, the painting is based on a photograph and therefore a scene she experienced. The temporality of the work is not that of the camera from which the image is derived, but that of painting itself. The Garden was shown in \"Visible Invisible : Against the Security of the Real\" at Parasol Unit, London from November 2009 to February 2010.",

To capture the presence of a tree, I need wind or an announcement saying 'tree' (always in an indirect mode)”, as the artist explained (in his book The missing pieces).version anglaise p.21 Snippets of recorded conversations are assembled and edited with blanks in the dialogues, background sounds (surround sound, bodily sounds) and music. In some more abstract works like Exhalaisons (Exhalations), the human being becomes a fragment reduced to the noise of a mouth or to breathing – a presence remains. The artist uses different modes of listening depending on the exhibition context, from domestic distribution (records, books) to public diffusion (concerts, installations). In terms of propagation in space, sound has no limits whereas images can only exist within its own limits (the frame). Petitgand's artworks embrace any architectural constraints for optimum deployment in space. Petitgand's sound pieces are constructions of sensations and affects that produce alterations on the spectator who is immersed in an environment via different emission sources and echos; there is no escaping the sound.Dominique Petitgand was born in 1965 in Laxou, France.

In fact Le bout de la langue could be the generic title of a large part of my work. Seemingly […] everything is obvious: the mental process along the way, speech is captured by disfunctional memory”. (« Notes, voix, entretiens », page 97). This metalinguistic artwork questions language in its relation to memory (blanks or losses) via fixed expressions: “Don't you see, I can't remember […] I have it on the tip of my tongue and it annoys me, […] Don't you see what I mean”. The density of the silences emphasizes the failing memory, the voice can only be quiet. Petitgand's characters spend their time trying to make an inventory, to classify, to order. Somewhere between a soliloquy and a monologue, the spoken sequences reintroduce a certain communication with the spectator who can become emotionally involved or have their imagination stimulated.",

    "artist_description": "Deimantas Narkevicius is a key figure in the Lithuanian art scene today. He has had many important retrospective exhibitions, at the Reina Sofia, Van Abbemuseum and Kunsthalle Bern, and he represented Lithuania at the 2001 Venice Biennale. He received the Vincent Award with Francis Alys in 2008. Trained as a sculptor, Deimantas Narkevicius then developed his work towards narrative through film and video. He considers History as central to his practice, as live material; he plays on the double meaning of the term history, by relating his personal story with that of his country. As witness to the dismantling of the Soviet bloc and the radical changes to society after the declaration of independence, Deimantas Narkevicius concentrates on the evocation and deconstruction of this heritage. Once in the XX Century (2005) has become emblematic of his work. There are images of Lenin, suspended above a crowd in Vilnius, which were shown a thousand times on CNN in the last ten years as symbolic of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the failure of Communism. But the manipulation operated during the editing process makes it seem as though the crowd is waiting and celebrating the installation of Lenin's sculpture. « Therefore there is something frightening in the possible repetition of a past that isn't so distant. » Deimantas Narkevicius. These films retrace the history of a country via a variety of places and portraits : a power plant, an abandoned nuclear missile base, a woman who survived the Vilnius ghetto, the official sculptor of Marx's effigy, the Lithuanian actor Donatas Banionis filmed 40 years after his appearance in the film Solaris by Tarkovskij. Deimantas Narkevicius deconstructs the linearity of history. The narrative belongs both to the past and the present which is emphasized by the use of techniques and stylistic principles typical of amateur films of the 1970s. These fictional documentaries are made with old equipment rather like what was used to make propaganda cinema during the Soviet era, but the distance permitted by fiction allows him to bring the discourse up to date.Deimantas Narkevicius was born in 1964 Utena, Lithuania. Lives and works in Vilnius.",

For this film, Deimantas Narkevicius used no animation or 3D effects, instead it is the silence of the place interrupted by the voice of the Russian soldier (who truly served on a military base in Lithuania) that creates this worrying atmosphere in which the execution of such an act becomes possible. The War Game (1965) by Peter Watkins was a source of inspiration, since he displays a personal and collective concern about the danger of the nuclear arms race in the United Kingdom in the 1960s.",

    "artist_description": "\"My installations draw upon imaginary and fragmented landscapes. When I introduce an object within an installation, it recalls the world from where it is derived from, like a fragment, it is a exploded variation.\"The universe of Martin Boyce is multifarious, extracting fragments of reference as varied as architecture, design, cinema, Scottish literature, Japanese poetry, etc. His forms do not fit perfectly within one category and exist more as ghosts of meaning. For instance, a sculpture can distinctly resemble a tilted ping-pong table although all the elements deviate from such a table to a great extent. Concrete trees by Joel and Jan Martel made in 1925 for the Decorative Arts Exhibition in Paris are a recurrent theme throughout the work of Boyce, as well as replicas in Electric trees and telephone booth (2006) and formal traces in works such as We are still and reflective (2007). The artist sees these objects as a perfect \"collapse\" between architecture and nature. The sculptures, consisting of trees, gates, vents, signs, dot the exhibition space, becoming a stage. While the forms and materials from were conceived to be functional, Martin Boyce uses them less as objects of representation and more as objects of emotion. Their titles, extracted from fragments of poems, pop songs, slogans, exist as a way to \"inhabit\" the installations and poeticize the real.Martin Boyce was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1967 where he lives and works today.",

    "description": "In the installation Our Love is like the Flowers, the Rain, the Sea and the Hours, Martin Boyce uses common elements from public gardens – trees, benches, trashbins– in a game which describes at once a social space and an abstract dream space. The trees, unique sources of light in the exhibition space, produce their own environment. These sculptures, as if extracted from a set, are enough to suggest an atmosphere, a landscape, or a movie. Their nocturnal depiction is ambivalent, hovering between poetic beauty and the potential threat of a park at night. Romantic views of nature blend with modern ideas of optimism and equality. However, from it emerges from a deep anxiety or paranoia. The perceived space cannot be localized inside a certain reality, rather it pertains to the everyone’s imagination. Therefore, in the installation, the viewer produces what he sees around him with his own eyes and own journey through the space. Its space becomes the psychological and emotional space of an idler. When describing the piece, Boyce has stated that the sculptures move far from the visible and the material generating more of an emotional state rather than theoretical reflection.",

The artist has assembled extracts of cartoons in which water is visible (the sea, bubbles, a stream, waves, etc.). Somewhat nostalgic, these extracts can recall either childhood cartoons or paintings by Hokusai. The continuous movement of the waves echoes the presentation of the film which also loops: a metaphor of life, a cyclical and continuous movement which nevertheless cannot be altered. The more the film is shown, the more the images become worn. The images progressively disappear with the scratches on the print. In fact, the work itself has a limited lifespan since the artist insists that the film should never be copied and that it should be shown until the images have entirely disappeared. Once the work is 'dead', only documentation will remain as in the case of a performance. Even though the images are the same, everyone has a different experience of the work until it erases and self-destructs completely only to remain in our memory.",

'To render an image' can be understood in the sense of crystallizing a set of archetypes and fantasies in a sensory mental representation. In the film Readings (2005), a researcher at the astronomical observatory in Meudon observes his bloody hand caused by the tooth he has just lost in a suspended space-time. “I would say that I construct my images like scenes in which the beginning and the end are missing, in which the scenario is contained in a very short lapse of time. They are often like a film still with no attached synopsis” according to Laurent Montaron. These images are formed within a time warp, a 'rupture' (Georges Didi-Huberman), a concept which is also present iconographically in BALBVTIO (2009, two identical films, shot differently, projected simultaneously).

The power of these images, which were widely diffused in the press, had a profound haunting impact on people's consciousness. This mode of transport – both futuristic and obsolete – crystallizes a collective imaginary which was fed by cinematic, literary and mythological fiction as Barthes would put it. A mass advances progressively towards the spectator, the camera glides right up to this monster, which is as graceful as a sea mammal, but flames perturb this vision. The mass disappears from view, making it impossible to define clearly, and finally exits the image field. Realized with an anaglyph process – which superimposes two slightly offset images to produce an effect of depth – the film prevents the experience of the third dimension and emphasizes the tricks of fabrication since it is viewed without special glasses. Due to its materiality and blurriness, the image, which is accompanied by a sinusoid wave, exerts a powerful haptic and hypnotic fascination.",

With the eye of a sculptor, she records Modernist architecture in Brazil, Bauhaus style in Germany, empty spaces, out of time. Thus she creates a classification of different types of spaces (different species). This Travelogue, as she calls it, is an organic process, a collage, an activity revealing connections between image and experience. Entirely black and white and with great economy (identical formats, modest sizes), the images convey an obsession with line, order, construction and emptiness. Charlotte Moth doesn't only have a nostalgic gaze on these spaces since she also proposes multiple readings. Acting as assembler, collector and archivist, she introduces a distanced point of view on her own work. With a Post-Conceptual approach, the artist proposes an in-depth and ambitious conception of the nature of the image and its authority.Charlotte Moth was born in Carshalton (UK) in 1978, and has been living in Paris since 2007.",

A percussionist gave a audio response to the film during the opening at the Halle für Kunst in  Lüneburg, in 2010. His reaction was then edited into the film. Thus the artist articulated several subjectivities to which we add our own. Light is a major protagonist in her work. Photography is envisaged from an uncertain point of view in terms of its usage, like live matter, formless, malleable and modular. With no title or date, the images express chance and thrilling juxtapositions. Although the darkroom remains the photographer's tool, Charlotte Moth deals with the image as a sculptor.

    "description": "In Monster (1996-97), the artist’s face becomes grotesque through the application of strips of transparent adhesive tape, typical of Gordon’s performance-based films that often depict his own body in action. Also characteristic of his work, the scene takes place in front of a mirror, suggesting the kind of personal self-reflection that one is capable of – both good and evil. The video makes clear cinematographic reference to the 'alter-ego' transformation in Mamoulian’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and to the “You looking at me?” sequence performed in front of a mirror by Robert De Niro in Scorsese’s Taxi Driver which also inspired Gordon’s through a looking glass (1999).",

    "description": "Blind Spencer is part of the series \"Blind Stars\" including hundreds of works in which the artist cut out the eyes of Hollywood stars, in a symbolically violent manner. An emptiness (some are burned letting appear a white or mirror background or a mirror) replaces the eyes, giving the impression of a blind eye deprived of all expression. Paradoxically, the work looks at us all the more intensely. The glamorous black and white portrait of Spencer Tracy evokes the golden age of Hollywood, with all of its codes like seductive smiles and directional light, not to mention a perverse use of the gaze.  Gordon talks about his work as a process of \"research, memory, of stories that took place, the films I've seen ... I am interested in looking for what happens when you look at something so long that it disappears. You are viewing an image, you start looking through the image, and you reach the other side and then you return to the surface. \" This act of cutting, pertinent to a new generation of artists focusing on the ready-made, image fragments and found sound footage, juxtaposes temporalities like in video editing and introduces a hint of melancholy. The act of cutting fascinates and repels, in what Freud called an experience of \"the uncanny.\" The viewer can only contemplate a loss of the soul which is traditionally reflected in the eyes. After Andy Warhol and his celebrity portraits, Douglas Gordon tracks the iconic and deadly character of his subjects.",

    "description": "Lifesize Draft is the second of two sculptures on a similar theme, the first one being Utopia Battery, (2008). The latter is also in an edition of 3, one of which is in the collection of the Ludwig Muzeum, Budapest. Although Lifesize Draft was made after Utopia Battery, Kisspal conceived it more or less at the same time and sees the two works as closely related. Both take as their central motifs the red flag. Whereas in Utopia Battery the flag unravels and the thread is coiled into spools as a direct result of the intervention of people in the room (the unravelling is activated by a motion sensor), in Lifesize Draft the flag is in a fixed almost completely unravelled state, the wool being in a giant ball. It is unclear therefore whether the flag is being unravelled – the communist régime deconstructed – or remade –  a new utopia under construction. Within the installation there is a DVD of found footage of American citizens knitting, predominantly during the Second World War, although some footage is from the First World War, to help the war effort by making socks for the troops. Among those shown knitting are President Roosevelt and his wife. There is a sense of community that ought to be the fundamental basis of any model state but which was lacking in former Communist reigmes. Kisspal thus appears tentatively to propose the possible reformulation of a social model which may or may not be Marxian. He refers to a récent revival of interest in Marx in Germany during the recent Financial crisis and state intervention in the banking industry as examples of a return to or interest in state control.",

While they deal with the specificities of the medium - like the notions of time and narrative, through the use of still shots - the aesthetic quality of her films remind of photography or painting (maybe because she had studied painting in school). Memories and atmospheres are conveyed through sensual images, colors and light. In her work, Tacita Dean relates the past to the present, often creating a certain melancholy: the artist focuses on stories, characters or architectural relics, and questions the notion of narrative by using both documentary and fiction devices.Tacita Dean was born in Canterbury, UK, in 1965.

The monumental and unnatural aspect of the baobabs turns them into strange and anthropomorphic personalities. Adding to the descriptive aspect of the film, the sound is a recording of the environment, of sounds made by animals, and participates in this peaceful contemplation. The still, almost fossilized aspect of the landscape makes it look majestic and eternal.\n\n« The camera, which examines in Baobab the ancestral and imposing trees of Madagascar, tries to capture the shadow and light effects, specific to photography. »\n(Essay by Julia Garimorth, in « Tacita Dean: Seven Books », published by Steidl / ARC/ Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, 2003).",

The victims suffered then from convulsions and the only way to heal them was to engage in a frenzied dance, as it was believed.  Called \"Tarantella\", this dance, appeared during the Middle Ages and was danced all along the 19th century.\nTo make this video, the artist asked a group of dancers to perform this uncontrolled dance in order to explore this borderline mental and physical state, close to a trance.

Parodying corporate branding and mass-produced design, Darbyshire's installations expose the hollow realities behind urban regeneration and government arts investment in social regenerative projects. At the centre of Darbyshire’s work is the observation that certain core human concerns - among them the look and feel of the built environment, the intersection of art and the social realm, the idea of community and eve the possibility  of visual pleasure - are, very often, framed in ways that are reductive, philosophically empty and serve only to further the interests of embedded power. Unusually for an artist who belongs to a generation that regularly revisits episodes form the (usually Modernist) past, Darbyshire’s focus is on what he calls the ‘mush and fug’ of contemporary Britain’s visual environment, something that in a high-wire act of chromatic and formal management he sequences into works that, while they speak eloquently of the quasyhomogeneity of much present day architecture and design, also have a resonant sculptural presence.*Matthew Darbyshire was born in Cambridge, UK, in 1977.

However, in front of each object lies a coin of different value—two yuan, one pound, one euro, one dollar—that silently reveals the material value of the household supplies. Underneath the video’s elegant surface there is a deep sense of critical irony, elaborated in the contradictory nature of the cheap plastic items and their sophistic visual interpretation. Kan poignantly and metaphorically comments on the economic and production at the base of today’s global market and shows that extremely influential visual spectacles can be generated by the most everyday of items.",

He describes his works as 'constructed situations', whose materials are the human voice, language, movement, and interaction, without the production of physical objects. What all of Sehgal's works have in common is that they remain only in the space and time they occupy, and in the memory of the work and its reception. Despite its immaterial character, the artist's work fulfills the conventions of visual art and functions fully within the infrastructure of the art gallery or museum. The work is present during the entire duration of an exhibition, it enters public and private collections and exists over time by being repeated. As he stated in an interview with Tim Griffin for Artforum: \"The reason I'm interested in the transformation of actions. . . is because I think that the appearance of both an excess supply of basic material goods and of mankind's endangering of the specific disposition of \"nature\" in which human life seems possible renders the hegemony of the dominant mode of production questionable. Obviously, this doesn't mean to propose an essentialist \"No\" to material objects in general but rather leads to the question as to how we could produce things that, on the one hand, aren't problematic and, on the other, are more interesting or complex, or less static.\"Artforum, May 2005, p. 218-219Tino Sehgal was born in London in 1976.

His sculptures and actions attempt to establish a direct, personal relationship between the artist and the viewer, using the work as a mediator. If art is supposed to be an agency of intellectual and emotional challenge, then the artist concludes that the audience should also be addressed beyond the institutional frame of the gallery and the museum, and that contact should be more direct. Kinmont's practice is primarily made up of various projects which occur outside of art institutions. From these projects he makes an archive that contains everything related to the organization and development of a given project including letters, contracts, sketches, photographs, video, watercolors, and sculpture. If an archive is acquired, the purchaser signs a contract which stipulates that he or she must make the archive available to the public and add relevant future material. As such, the collector becomes an archivist as he or she helps to make transparent the project itself. Ben Kinmont was born in 1963 in Burlington, Vermont, USA. He lives and works in  San Francisco.",

The first part of Digger Dug made in 2004 was reactivated during the Kadist exhibition, for instance as an exchange with an anthropologist concerning ethics in projects that are both artistic and social. Thus the archive contained a new text and a series of photographs, videos and notes made during the exhibition. Considering the current program of the foundation that links philanthropy and art, Ben Kinmont's work and particularly the Digger Dug archive appears like a major piece for the collection. This work is simultaneously a theoretical and practical 'toolbox' that can evolve with the program of the foundation. The San Francisco Diggers were a community action group of improvisation actors operating between 1966 and 1968 and mostly based in the district of Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco. Their policies were close to community anarchism mixing claims to liberty with community conscience. They were closely associated and shared members with a guerilla theatre group called San Francisco Mime Troupe. The Diggers proposed a free food service at Golden Gate Park in the Haight-Ashbury district at 4pm everyday generally feeding over 200 people with no other food source. They opened a number of free stores in the Haight-Ashbury district in which any item could be taken or given.",

Since 1996, the artist has been concentrating on his family members and stages them with burlesque humor. Just as Buster Keaton, he is at once actor-director, his wife and children the only other actors, and his apartment the improvised set: he uses available furniture and objects, creates an artificial island in his kitchen and constructs a tree house for Treehouse Kit (2005), a work in which the sculpture takes part in the video installation. The theatrical aspect of the set relates to the playful situations. Each one of Ben-Ner's films participates, as an episode, to a collection of fables about human nature, reenacting stereotypical motifs found in literature and cinema, such as the desert island (\"Berkeleys Island\" 1999) or \"Moby Dick\" (2000).Guy Ben-Ner was born in 1969, Ramat Gan, Israel.

Eastern religion and new-age spirituality are dominant themes in Gastaldon's work — especially the idea of transformation. In her sculptures, yarn and thread form mountainous cones and internal organs, while her drawings depict mystical creatures with exaggerated smiley faces that morph into fantastical landscapes.

In an age of numerical technology, Cadere's rhythmic system echoes in a particular manner together with the processes of digitization.

The lyrics written on the wall produced a silent story, in a musical way that remains implicit (unlike certain installations by the artist where lyrics can be heard on headphones). The writing in hologram print displayed on the wall recalls the iridescent surface of CDs. The refrain \"I've be waitin'...\" introduces temporality and musicality in the field of meaning. This song is a commentary on pop music with a meta-poetic dimension. It depicts the life of a songwriter: \"I 've been waitin' for the producers [...] I left home when I was a kid [...] I've been on the road indefinitely [...] I played in bars, hotels, parties.\" Like in \"Actualité\" a 16mm film by Matthia Poledna from 2001, Saâdane Afif and Lili Reynaud Dewar paint a nostalgic and idealized portrait of the artist as a pop star.",

The artist makes use of an eccentric shelf by designer Ron Arad, displaying dripping paint on the wall while the shelf itself holds a collection of books on piracy, compiled together by the owner of the work. \"Power chords\" (2005), perhaps the most ambitious project by the artist to date, is both a work for publication and several exhibitions. The installation depicts automatic electric guitars, playing scores orchestrated by a computer program. The chords are defined by color sequences derived from André Cadere's wooden segments. Yet with Afif's displacement, the artist hints to the color and rhythmic sound dimensions vis-à-vis Cadere, inside a genre of synesthesia. In an age of numerical technology, Cadere's rhythmic system echoes in a particular manner together with the processes of digitization. Afif suggests a principle of encoding the world underlying the real, or rhythmic language before the Tower of Babel. Saâdane Afif was born in 1970 in Vendome, France. He lives and works in Paris and Berlin.",

    "description": "In this work, Saâdane Afif quotes André Cadere's round wooden batons using the copy share and remix principles. Cadere's sculptures, batons constituted with a mathematical chain of painted wood segments containing one error in the succession of colors, can be presented according to any possible configuration (on the wall, floor, hung or not). In the catalogue documenting the project, Power chords, there is a facsimile (another type of quotation) of one of Cadere's conferences: “Présentation d’un travail, utilisation d’un travail” (presentation of a work, use of a work). The batons appear in different works by Afif like tools of an essential vocabulary: with nuances of black (Black spirit, 2004), of white (Ghost, 2005), translated into sound (Power chords, 2005) or light (Untitled 1971/2003-B 0230 1004 =30= =22x23=, 2003).\nSaâdane Afif questions the generative capacity of error as the title suggests: A few more mistakes. He toys with some of the defining parameters of Cadere's batons (nuances of grey, presentation as stalactites) in order to disrupt them. The title suggests that the work is in fact a portrait. Gilbert & George are two artists who perform and make photomontages about the concept of a couple. Afif pays homage to them via the minimal index of wooden batons as a reference to their notion of 'living sculptures'.",

    "artist_description": "Brenna Youngblood’s images reflect the experiences of a working-class woman of color growing up in Central California and eventually landing in Los Angeles. Ironically, her photo collages, assemblages, and paintings have often been compared to the work of Robert Rauschenberg or Richard Prince, but they are closer in spirit with more contemporary artists like Mark Bradford. Youngblood’s work captures a kind of social architecture, that is, an out-of-focus zone where portraits of people become landscapes and buildings become familiar characters. It is in these marginal transitions where Youngblood investigates issues of identity, race, and social status.",

    "description": "Brenna Youngblood’s C-Print titled, Red Door (2007) is representative of the artist’s interest in conceptual photography, of which she is primarily known for in addition to multimedia collage and assemblage. Red Door like her other photoconceptual work draws imagery from the everyday and offers new meaning to these seemingly mundane objects, and places. By closely cropping the image of a red door—the color reminiscent of that often used by Robert Rauschenberg— Youngblood inspires a tension between potential meaning and the purposeful ambiguity of her imagery, leaving the viewer to wonder about her formal decisions.",

    "description": "Rachel E. Foster uses printmaking, sculpture, and photography to illuminate the nearly invisible. For her source material she combs the digital world for bits of strange information that seep into our daily reality. These clues, be they coded sequences or simple phrases, become part of her puzzle; by reframing information she makes us reconsider it through a different lens. Language is embedded in Foster’s work, but it is subject to play, often becoming obscured or reoriented. In Ghost I (2009) the word “ghost” becomes ghosted, rendered ominously in white chalk on black paper so that it resembles an apparition. Average Lifespan (2009) calculates the average lifespan of eight famous poets. This seemingly random equation reveals to us the age at which the poets died and forges a posthumous relationship among them.",
