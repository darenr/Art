Iscapes (Information-scapes) 1.0 exemplifies the expansion of architecture into the digital realm in the late 1990s, condensing in its narration the potential of the digital design process. The digital video player, like a jewel box, discloses looping footage of commonplace objects fluidly mutating into buildings and back again. The New Yorkbased architects who created Iscapes have described it as “consumable architectures for a digital culture, neither appliance nor building.”
