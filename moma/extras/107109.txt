In this woodcut manifesto, Brücke artists "call together all youth. . . . in opposition to older, well established powers. Whoever renders directly and authentically that which impels him to create is one of us." Brücke artists also used woodcuts to embellish the annual reports, exhibition announcements, and catalogues they sent to "passive members"—patrons who supported the group through annual donations.
