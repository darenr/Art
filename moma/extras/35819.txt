For the 1922 Ballets Suédois production (premiere Paris). Choreography by Jean Börlin. Music by Arthur Honegger. Based on the poem "Skating Rink à Tabarin/Ballet-aux-Patins/pour la musique" (1920) by Ricciotto Canudo Skating Rink is the first of Léger's two commissions for the Ballets Suédois, the company founded by Swedish art collector Rolf de Maré on the model of Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Léger's sense that the rhythm of industry and the modern city's everyday bustle are the most entrancing of spectacles is captured in this production. The dancers' mechanical actions—reminiscent of the unending rhythm of the assembly line—create a centrifugal sweep around a working-class neighborhood's  skating rink.
