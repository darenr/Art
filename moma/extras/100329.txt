Shattered, which depicts a microscopic view of human bone, is one of over twenty works made by the New York–based artist Jeanne Silverthorne that take molecular images of the human body as their model. Shattered's composition, although abstract, mimics the glacial formation shown in Caspar David Friedrich’s painting The Polar Sea (1824) in the Hamburger Kunsthalle. The entire work, including its frame, is constructed of cast rubber.
