Bradford is best known for his largeâ€“scale paper collages made from a diverse range of found materials. These include curling papers and dyes used in his mother's hair salon, printed, photocopied, or hand-lettered posters and advertisements torn from lampposts and buildings in his neighborhood, foil, paint, and many other materials. This combination of diverse secondhand materials, layered one on top of the other, parallels Bradford's subject matter: the cultural and socioeconomic melting pot that is South Los Angeles. The text that emerges from this work, "James Brown is Dead," refers to the death, in 2006, of a key figure among African Americans. For Bradford, the musician's life and death mark the rise and fall of black music, from rock and roll to the sometimes degraded social commentary of rap.
