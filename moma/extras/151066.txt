In 1967, in a radical gesture, the artist VALIE EXPORT shed both her father’s and husband’s names to take on a new identity, simultaneously announcing her presence on the art scene. A similar act of provocation is at the root of four iconic portraits titled Identity Transfer, which show the artist impersonating a pimp, dressed in tight black trousers, a curly, short–haired wig, heavy gold necklaces and bracelets, and exaggerated makeup. The resulting images call into question conventional gender roles and reflect a moment in history when male and female clothing and hairstyles merged.
