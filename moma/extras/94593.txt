Developed by Brooklyn-based Crye Precision in cooperation with the US Army Natick Soldier Center, this camouflage—which exploits optical illusions and high-resolution digital fades from one color to another—comes in one standardized pattern and colorway that is suitable for use anywhere, whether desert, mountain, or jungle. The MultiCam's base color is more neutral than a desert or woodland, and the pattern itself is subtle enough to reflect the shades of any surrounding area, thus allowing it to be adaptable to multiple environments, seasons, elevations, and light conditions.
