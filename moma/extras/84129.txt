This drawing is part of a series Cohen terms Stereotomic Permutations. It uses the graphic convention of stereotomy, a drawing method of orthographic projection used to guide the cutting of stone. This technique employs converging lines to show depth in space, similar to perspective drawing. Cohen combined stereotomy with two-point perspective, creating anamorphosis; the deformed image appears in its true form only when viewed from an unconventional angle. This drawing describes mirrored, nonidentical twin forms in a distorted representation of serial and symmetrical structures. Cohen writes of this series, "These projects propose stereotomy as a new interlocutor between perspective and three dimensional, orthographic architectural space."
