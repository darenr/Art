This motif is based on John's lifesize bronze sculpture of a paintbrush–filled Savarin coffee can (1960). The composition was created first as a poster for a retrospective exhibition of his work, which explains its attention–getting scale. For the background, Johns used a fragment of a then–recent painting of crosshatched strokes. By showing the early sculpture and the painting together, he represented the span of his work at the time of the retrospective.
