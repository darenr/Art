The megaphone first appeared in Kentridge's work in 1990, and it continues to be a common motif. Megaphones "indicate what needs to be heard or seen, outside of oneself," the artist has said. The nude figure is both a self-portrait and a picture of Felix Teitelbaum, one of the main protagonists in Kentridge's work at the time.
