In her design of several kitchens at the 1931 German Building Exhibition in Berlin, Reich embraced the rational principles of domestic reformers Christine Frederick and Erna Meyer. Reich's Apartment for a Single Person featured a cooking cabinet that was subsequently put into production by Otto Kahn. When closed, it appeared to be an ordinary closet or wardrobe, but when opened it revealed a sink, shelves, two burners, drawers, counter space, and a hook on which to hang a kettle.
