Brothers who are artistic collaborators, the Chapmans emerged as members of the Young British Artists (YBA) group in London in the early 1990s. Their sculptures, installations, and works on paper are deliberately aimed at confronting middle-class values and notions of good taste. Among their controversial early works are fiberglass sculptures of figures whose facial features have been replaced by genitalia.Despite their sardonic nihilism and bad-boy reputations, the Chapmans' work is often grounded in art history, including repeated references to Francisco de Goya and other proponents of satire and fantasy. These etchings, for example, are from a portfolio inspired by the Surrealist game of chance known as Exquisite Corpse, in which a sheet of paper is folded into four parts corresponding to the head, chest, trunk, and legs of a human body. Each player draws one section and then conceals it before passing it on to the next. In that manner the two brothers took turns drawing on prepared etching plates to make this portfolio. Combining horror with humor and clearly relishing the minute, obsessive details that are possible in etching, the Chapmans concocted the hallucinatory figures in this series by connecting various bizarre, incongruous, and often sexualized or scatological forms.
