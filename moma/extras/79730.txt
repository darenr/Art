To achieve the simultaneously luminescent and earthy texture of Scalar (from the Latin word for “ladder”), Rockburne worked with crude oil, an industrial material she favored largely because it was cheaper than paint. She had recently visited archaeological sites in Peru, and had been greatly impressed by these stacked–stone ruins, an experience that influenced the form of Scalar. The ancient structures called to mind her studies of set theory, a branch of mathematics that looks at groupings of objects. “It’s not only about huge stones,” she wrote at the time, “so much as it is about the experience of how these objects relate to particular intellectual inquiries: the decisions of mass and interstices, one never dominating the other.”
