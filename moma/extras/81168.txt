Armleder was influenced by Fluxus, the irreverent art movement of the 1960s and 1970s, but was also awed by the Suprematist painting of Kazimir Malevich, one of the founders of abstract art in the early twentieth century. Armleder remembers visiting MoMA as a child and being captivated by Malevich's Suprematist Composition: White on White of 1918.
