Like much of the artist's work, this large collage evokes Lidén's subversively humorous interactions with the urban landscape. Untitled (Poster Painting) is an accumulation of paper fliers and advertisements the artist gathered from the street, covered with a layer of pristine white paper. Erasing or silencing the colorful jumble of information, Lidén presents a monochrome—a blank palette at odds with the typically oversaturated metropolitan environment.
