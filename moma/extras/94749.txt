In the mid–1960s Schendel produced a vast body of work called Monotypes, consisting of minimalist, gestural drawings on rice paper. For Schendel drawing was a form of meditation, of rumination, a way of marking time and investigating it. These Perfurados, once bound books, have been separated over time. A mechanical tool was substituted for the artist's hand: the paper has been perforated by a hole–punch to create an abstract, minimalist composition.
