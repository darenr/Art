Executed by others according to the artist's instructions, LeWitt's works embody his guiding principle that "once the idea of the piece is established in the artist's mind and the final form is decided, the process is carried out blindly." In keeping with this doctrine, LeWitt described the realization of his works as "potentially performative," likening this process to that of a "composer that writes notes and then a pianist plays the notes. Within that situation there is ample room for both to make a statement of their own."Starting with basic shapes and simple marks, these works are built up until the result "renders form without space," creating a sense of depth while maintaining the physical integrity of the wall. The resulting works reflect the duration of their own making, a slow and deliberate process. LeWitt's instructions for Wall Drawing #1187—made late in his career—call for layers of graphite scribbles that build six densities of gray bands, which take on a temporal, undulating quality.
