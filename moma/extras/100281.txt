Study for Columbus and Isabella I evinces Bryan Hunt's interest in specific historical events and, more widely, in the idea of exploration and new discovery. It is one of several drawings related to a sculpture of the same name that was conceived by the artist while he was living and working in Mojacar, Spain. The abstracted forms are those of the great Spanish explorer, seen on the left, and his royal patron, the queen.
