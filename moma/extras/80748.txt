Weiner's medium is language. As a Conceptual artist his constructions of words and phrases seek to affect our perception of the spaces they are presented in. In appearance the language used by the artist is plain and neutral. In effect, however, this particular piece is quite evocativeâ€”the artist invites us to imagine ourselves surrounded by sand and rocks as we enter a space inhabited by art.
