Barrios, a teacher, critic, painter, and sculptor, was a key figure in the introduction of Conceptual art to Colombia with his series Grabados populares, or Popular Prints. Rather than producing traditional limited editions, Barrios issued his Popular Prints in great numbers by having them printed in local newspapers, signing and numbering the works for anyone who asked him to do so. These prints, mostly published between 1972 and 1984, often display the lush, dreamlike quality found in his paintings and collages, which combine artâ€“historical, cultural, and religious references in fantastic and surreal scenes.
