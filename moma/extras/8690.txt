The split view on this exhibition poster shows the importance attached to the kitchen in the design of affordable modern housing. The devastation and extreme deprivation in Vienna that followed World War I radicalized many architects and designers, inspiring them to engage with class politics and, on a more practical level, to confront the city’s chronic housing shortage. One of the initiatives in which architect Grete Schütte-Lihotzky became involved while in Vienna was the Gesellschaftsund Wirtschaftsmuseum (Society and Economy Museum), an organization established in 1924 to foster awareness of the relationship between design, the urban environment, and social wellbeing using informational graphics like this poster.
