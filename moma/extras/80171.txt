Known for his energetic compositions with bold colors and snappy rhythms, Davis painted quintessentially modern American subjects. Among his sources of inspiration, he listed “skyscraper architecture; the brilliant colors on gasoline stations; chain store fronts and taxicabs” and “jazz music.”Long before Andy Warhol and other Pop artists mined the world of trademark brands, Davis incorporated imagery from logos, commercial signage, and modern packaging into his paintings. In the 1920s—the “golden age” of advertising—the artist created Lucky Strike, a visual riff on a pack of cigarettes, and Odol, a sleek, streamlined ode to a bottle of mouthwash.
