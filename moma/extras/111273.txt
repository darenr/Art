Many artists at Rorke's Drift expressed Christian themes in their work, offering innovative readings of the Bible that echoed political tensions in South Africa. Nkosi was also heavily influenced by the Black Consciousness Movement, founded by Stephen Biko in the mid-1960s, which encouraged the expression of black culture and pride in it. This print is from a series of thirteen linocuts that conveys messages of hope, suffering, and liberation through dramatic depictions of the suffering of a black Christ.
