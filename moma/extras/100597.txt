Executed while Arp was visiting Schwitters in Hannover, this print portfolio was published as the fifth issue of Merz magazine. The title "Arpaden" is a made-up word meaning "Arp things." In these seven lithographs, Arp created a series of simple yet graphically powerful "object pictures"—Mustache Hat, The Navel Bottle, Mustache Watch, Eggbeater—that combine allusions to body parts and everyday things.
