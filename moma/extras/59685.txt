This print reuses lithographic plates from Savarin (1977). Here the brush–filled coffee can sculpture acts as a surrogate for the artist. Johns based this work on a lithographic self–portrait by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch (1866–1944) in which Munch depicted a skeletal arm beneath his face. Johns's pays homage to Munch with the initials E. M. at the bottom right.
