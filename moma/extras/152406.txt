SimCity is an open-ended city-building simulation originally developed for personal computers before being adapted to multiple gaming systems (with many sequels). It makes the delicate balance of chance and regulation in urban planning into a game: players begin by mapping out a section of land by zoning regulation—residential, commercial, or industrial—and then add buildings and infrastructure systems, such as public transportation and power grids, and construct and upgrade buildings based on real-world factors such as noise, neighborhoods, and the availability of services. Unlike most games, SimCity has no goals, end point, or dominant ethos, outside of optional scenarios: players may think politically and strategically about how cities are run and societies are built, or they may induce mass chaos for their own amusement.
