This storage pot was slip-cast from a plaster mold, a method used for mass-producing ceramics. Designed by Bogler in the ceramics workshops of the Bauhaus, the robust, simple form reflected the school's conviction that basic geometric shapes were well suited to industrial production. Given the depressed state of the economy and the uneven quality of the prototypes, however, the pots were never licensed for large-scale manufacture, despite initial interest at trade fairs in both Frankfurt and Leipzig.
