These “informal utensils,” as the designer calls them, offer solutions based on specific yet flexible functions that are reflected in their names: Clamp-a-book, Clamp-a-cable, Clamp-a-hook, Clamp-a-candle, Clamp-a-railing, Clamp-a-towel, and Clamp-a-book II. The devices exploit the utility of familiar forms, such as table legs, electrical pipes, and bookshelves, to offer a range of quotidian services. This prototype family of plastic clamps by Van Ast is expected to go into production in 2009.
