In 1923 more than 100,000 visitors flocked to the first Salon des Arts MÃ©nagers (Exhibition of Household Arts) in Paris to admire modern kitchens, new vacuum cleaners, and other domestic innovations. The aims of the salon were both educational and commercial, in keeping with similar fairs that were being established in other European centers at the time. This poster was commissioned for the 1928 salon by a society promoting the development of the French gas industry. By dramatically highlighting the gas valve, Bernard focused attention on the simple gesture required to release gas for purposes of cooking, heating, and refrigeration.
