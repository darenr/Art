Strut, inspired by a novel by the American science fiction author Philip K. Dick, also draws on the legacy of artists such as Jean Dubuffet and Cy Twombly,whose influence is evident in the near-incidental drawn lines and graffiti-like stains, as well as in footand handprints on the unpainted areas. Bradleyâ€™s gritty and emotionally charged paintings frequently combine references to fine art and popular culture. A work like Strut pokes fun at the sometimes uneasy partnership between contemporary art and pop culture while drawing attention to the possibilities of contemporary painting.
