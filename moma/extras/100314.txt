Close Pin Prop, like several of Richard Serra's sculptures,balances upright against a wall without the aid of any external support. Serra has spoken of his art as "nonmetaphorical, nondepictive, and nonillusionist," and considers the process of construction and the weighty physicality of his sculptures to be of utmost importance in their meaning. "To deprive art of its uselessness is to make other than art. I am interested in sculpture which is nonutilitarian, nonfunctional. Any use is a misuse." The titles of many of Serra's works allude to artists and public figures; the title of Close Pin Prop refers to the artist Chuck Close.
