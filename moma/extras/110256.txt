Biowall is a woven scaffold that becomes a partition when colonized by living plants. In their attempt to create a modular building system based on structures found in nature, the designers looked at several geometries, such as Penrose tiles (pairs of shapes that tile a plane so that no section of the pattern is repeated) and Synetic structures (airy, lacelike basketries of thin arcs over which pressure is evenly distributed). They opted for a weave of twelve small circles made of one-millimeter fiberglass rods around which the plants could grow and creep. “The construction is based on the principle of self-similarity, translating a biological construction from the nanoscale to the macroscale. It can be seen in our natural environment in the formation of bubbles, living cells, and water molecules,” the designers have explained.
