Brodovitch was awarded third prize in the Seating Units category for this knock-down rocking chair. Described as "exceptionally simple and comfortable," it employs basic construction methods and inexpensive materials. Its parts can be cut from standard sheets of plywood with a minimum of waste. Brodovitch came to the United States in 1930 after fleeing Russia and establishing himself as a graphic designer in Paris. He was art director for the New York department store Saks Fifth Avenue, the American Red Cross, I. Miller Shoes, and Portfolio magazine but is most remembered for his influential tenure as art director at Harper's Bazaar from 1934 to 1958.
