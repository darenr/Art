In her designs for several kitchens at the 1931 German Building Exhibition in Berlin, Reich embraced the rational principles of the domestic reformers Christine Frederick and Erna Meyer. Reichâ€™s Apartment for a Single Person featured a cooking cabinet that subsequently was put into production by Otto Kahn. When closed, it appeared to be an ordinary closet or wardrobe, but when opened it revealed a sink, shelves, two burners, drawers, counter space, and a hook on which to hang a kettle.
