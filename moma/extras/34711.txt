For this collage, Paolozzi appropriated a robot figure from a British children's book on inventions in the 1930s and placed it in an environment culled from a German book of tile manufacturers. Most often identified as a founder of Pop art, Paolozzi said, "What I like to think I'm doing is an extension of radical Surrealism." The figure of the automaton was dear to the Surrealists, who saw in the half-human, half-machine the confusion between the living and the inanimate that Sigmund Freud called the uncanny. Paolozzi refers to this tradition while updating it to reflect Pop's fascination with industry and technology.
