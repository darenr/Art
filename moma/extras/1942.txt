The Arco Floor Lamp solves a practical problem: the need for an overhead lamp that does not require drilling a hole in the ceiling. A street lamp inspired the Castiglioni brothers’ design, demonstrating Achille Castiglioni’s motto that “design demands observation.” By inserting a steel arch into a heavy marble pedestal, the designers created a lamp that is able to illuminate objects eight feet away from its base—far enough to light the middle of a dining table.
