Since the late 1970s, Mucha has made wall-mounted sculptures out of found materials and objects—such as chairs, signs, windows, and floorboards—encased in glass. Kalkar, which is built from a salvaged door, is named for the train station in the city of the same name, in northwestern Germany not far from Düsseldorf and Cologne. Mucha, who was trained as a mechanic before enrolling in art school, has had a lifelong fascination with his country’s national railway system; many of his works refer to specific train stations or to the theme of travel more generally. Mucha focuses on the convergence of German history and industry, treating his materials as vestiges of time and memory.
