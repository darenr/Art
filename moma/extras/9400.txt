The years before World War I saw a proliferation of cultural journals, which played an important role in the transmission of new ideas. Particularly significant was Blaue Reiter, an almanac first published by Kandinsky and Marc in Munich in May 1912. In the ambitious prospectus for the publication, Marc wrote that it would “show the latest movements in French, German, and Russian painting. Subtle connections are revealed between modern and Gothic and primitive art, connections with Africa and the vast Orient, with the highly expressive, spontaneous folk and children’s art, and especially with the most recent musical developments in Europe and the new ideas for theater of our time.” In its very conception, the almanac aimed at dissolving boundaries—those between national schools, temporal realms, and media. Kandinsky’s role as one of its editors helped him to build up his vast network of international connections: in soliciting essays and images for publication, as well as art for exhibition with the Blaue Reiter group, he corresponded with artists in cities throughout Europe.
