Molzahn was a painter-turned-typographer who studied at the art school in Weimar that became the Bauhaus in 1919. He taught typography and graphic design in Magdeburg, Germany, before moving to the Breslau Kunstakademie (art school) in 1928, and was a founding member of the Ring Neuer Werbegestalterr (Circle of new advertising designers). Throughout the 1920s he remained in close touch with Walter Gropius and other members of the Deutsche Werkbund, the German association for industrial design reform that commissioned stationery, publicity materials, and posters from several adherents of The New Typography.
