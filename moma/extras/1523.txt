Uno sull'altro, a modular system of slotted stacking shelves, was featured in MoMA's 1972 exhibition Italy: The New Domestic Landscape. Curated by architect Emilio Ambasz, the exhibition comprised 150 Italian design objects from the previous decade as well as a dozen unique "environments" by well-known designers. The stacking shelves exemplify the strong interest at the time in flexible design suited to new concepts of informality for life-styles and domestic environments. Trained in architecture, La Pietra established a studio in 1964 and worked as a design consultant to furniture, accessories, and lighting manufacturers. An architect, designer, theoretician, and writer, he is currently based in Milan.
