"We all agreed that [the head of the State Film Agency] should not expect us to design anything that resembled Japanese, American, Russian, or Swiss posters," explained Tomaszewski. "I was trying to find the essence of the film.  I was trying to  feel the impression that the film had on me, whether it was a lyrical film, comedy, drama, sport or war film.  I wanted to illustrate this essence with my own language, in my own way." Tomaszewski won five awards at the 1948 International Poster Biennale in Vienna, and as head of the poster studio at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts from 1952 to 1985 he was the central figure of the Polish Poster School.
