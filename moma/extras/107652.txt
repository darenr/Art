An AIDS public service announcement produced by the international advocacy group Steps for the Future, Orlando Mesquita's short film The Ball presents a surprisingly lighthearted view of condom use in Africa. In a village in Mozambique, a man interrupts a group of boys playing soccer and accuses them of stealing his condoms to make soccer balls. Determined to carry on playing, the boys go off to buy a new condom for another ball. The ball is ingeniously constructed by wrapping the inflated condom first in a plastic bag and then in a piece of cloth, and tying it up with string. When they run out of string, the boys make use of a baby's jacket hanging out to dry on a clothesline, unraveling the wool from a loose strand. Mesquita has made more than thirty Þlms over a twenty–year career, including fiction features, documentaries, and educational programs, yet none have had quite as popular an impact as this whimsical piece of social advocacy.
