Brecht’s Eight Piano Transcriptions for David Tudor is based on scores written in 1962. The simple one– or two–word instructions offer numerous conceptual or performative possibilities. Most were performed at several Fluxus concerts, Brecht leaving the interpretation up to the performers or, when seen on a page, up to the imagination of the viewer—an “Event” in the mind.
