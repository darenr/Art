On occasion, Reverón based his figure paintings on old narrative themes. Here, the allusion may be to the water–maidens of Hispanic folklore, traditionally depticted with shimmering, straw–colored bodies and golden hair. Reverón's nearly monochromatic "white" paintings represent the perceptual experience of forms dissolving into intense light. In the 1930s, working indoors, the artist began making such monochromes, with puzzling forms in shadowy interiors.
