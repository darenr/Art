In this satirical series, Ensor updated a traditional theme of Christian morality. In the first sheet, Death, in the form of a winged skeleton, embraces seven figures that personify the seven deadly sins. In each of the subsequent sheets, the artist depicted his contemporaries engaged in each vice: gluttony, sloth, pride, anger, avarice, envy, and lust. A small skeleton or devil mocks the obscene, feckless behavior of the central characters. This set of prints is particularly rare; it is in pristine condition and its colors are fresh because it was preserved in the original collector's album.
