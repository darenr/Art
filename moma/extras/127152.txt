Edited by La Monte Young in 1961, designed by George Maciunas, and published in 1963, An Anthology contains contributions by more than a dozen artists, many of whom would become associated with Fluxus. An early manifestation of the genre of artists’ books—books in which the content is the artwork—An Anthology contains a diverse array of contributions, including musical notation, visual and concrete poetry, graphics, instruction–based works, and essays. One primary inclusion is Henry Flynt’s 1961 essay “Concept Art (Provisional Version),” in which Flynt frames Conceptualism as “an art of which the material is ‘concepts,’ as the material of for ex.[ample] music is sound. Since ‘concepts’ are closely bound up with language, concept art is a kind of art of which the material is language.”
