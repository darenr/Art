By repurposing methods of television, cinema, and video production, Ken Okiishi's work responds to the migration of images, information, and language in a world increasingly reshaped by digital media. gesture/data combines video recordings with painting to create hybrid image-objects suspended between analog and digital technologies. The artist was inspired by viewing Wood, Wind, No Tuba (1980), an abstract painting by Joan Mitchell (American, 1925-1992), in MoMA's Agnes Gund Garden Lobby. As he photographed the painting with his iPhone, Okiishi was fascinated by the transformation of its original scale and physical presence into a small, portable field of glowing pixels and code. Okiishi paints directly onto the surfaces of flat-screen monitors that play mash-ups of 1990s VHS home recordings of sitcoms and advertisements partially recorded over with sequences from new, digitally broadcast television. gesture/data playfully suggests connections between the physical traces of gestural painting and the swipes, taps, and pinches through which we now access digital images, subject to infinite redistribution.
