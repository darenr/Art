The first electric kettle appeared in the 1890s, but the potentially hazardous proximity of water and electricity and the lack of effective electricity distribution networks delayed its widespread acceptance. Though it was competitively priced for domestic and export markets, AEG's kettle was still more expensive, smaller, and slower to heat the water than a conventional kettle on a gas or wood burner. This comparative inadequacy was overshadowed, however, by effective branding, high-quality materials and construction, and modern styling, which was developed by Germanyâ€™s foremost industrial designer to fit in with both living rooms and kitchens.
