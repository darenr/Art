This collage is inscribed Sammler und Jäger (Winterkirschenernte), which means "Gatherers and hunters (winter cherry harvest)" but also refers to the Austrian–German word for hemorrhoids. The work is alternately titled Hummeln, from the German phrase Hummeln im Hintern haben—similar to the English expression "ants in your pants." West used this as a poster image for his exhibition at Galerie Julius Hummel in Vienna in 1983, punning on the gallerist’s name. The artist has created a number of posters for his exhibitions, often drawing and painting on them and affixing supplementary items. Adding titles and dedications and then framing them, he creates hybrids of reproductions and originals, generally featuring the humorous and crass plays on words and indelicate use of materials that pervade his work as a whole.
