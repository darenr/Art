This work, with its striking upward perspective, is based on a photograph Sasnal took of his wife, Anka. Sasnal explores the possibilities and boundaries of painting and of seeing rather than addressing any specific set of narrative or abstract subjects. He makes paintings and drawings in a multiplicity of styles, depending on a broad array of source materials and art-historical precedents.
