In 1923 Bolotowsky moved from Constantinople to New York, where he studied painting at the National Academy of Design. Like Burgoyne Diller and other of his contemporaries, Bolotowsky began to work in an abstract mode after first seeing Piet Mondrian's paintings, in 1933. His gridded compositions are, he said, a "byproduct of the influence of Mondrian . . . except that the result visually is not the same." One striking difference is the tondo format of this canvas, common in the artists work; he made his first tondo painting by stretching a canvas across the rim of a wagon wheel. A longtime instructor of art, Bolotowsky spent 1946â€“48 at Black Mountain College in North Carolina, where he taught painting and drawing and served as acting director during Josef Albers's sabbatical.
