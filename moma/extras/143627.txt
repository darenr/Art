Red Cell with Conduit is a luminous color field divided in two: the upper three-quarters represent what Halley describes as an interior cell, and the lower quarter contains a conduitâ€”a diagrammatic scheme that suggests the flow of information or electricity or the transportation of materials. With this hybrid of high-modernist abstraction and cryptic map, Halley has created a rigorously simple iconography in order, as he has said, to "reinterpret geometric abstraction as a representation of the industrial and post-industrial landscape."
