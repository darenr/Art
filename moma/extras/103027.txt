Schönfeldt employs irony in mock-pedantic works about the commodification of traditional African objects and turns the question of authenticity and commodity onto his own work. The artist’s depiction of three-headed female animals is inspired by Hindu, Assyrian, and Greco-Roman iconography and relates to his interest in pan-African religion.
