Commonly called the Bracelet of Life, the MUAC is used in the field by volunteers with Doctors Without Borders to identify cases of acute malnutrition as quickly as possible in children ages six months to five years. The color-coded tool can be used by any language group. The band is wrapped around the child's upper left arm; the circumference of the arm corresponds to a color, ranging from green (normal) to orange (moderate malnutrition) to red (serious malnutrition and risk of death). The Bracelet of Life campaign, which draws attention to the devastating famine in Sudan, began in 1998.
