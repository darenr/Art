The thick surface of this panel indicates the prolonged duration of its making. Monet worked on this and other paintings over a period of several years, building up layers of paint as he altered and refined the compositions. This ethereal image features softly flowing passages of cloud reflections amid a tranquil surface punctuated by pink lilies.  The notably delicate palette of this painting differentiates it from others and suggests a silvery light suffusing the pond's surface. Since the 1890s Monet had indulged a passion for exploring a single subject in extensive series that chronicle its changing appearance at various times of day and in different kinds of weather.
