Demeter refers to classical sculpture in both title and presentation. In Greek mythology, Demeter was the goddess of agriculture, but this bulbous, primordial mass of matter, set on a bronze, heavily volumetric pedestal, is a far cry from her idealized classical representation. In his sculpture, William Tucker implies the presence of the body in abstract art with references to ancient art and mythology. The artist has written, "I see the role of contemporary sculpture as preserving and protecting the source of mystery, of the unknown, in public life."
