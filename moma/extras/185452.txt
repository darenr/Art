These radio sets departed from the styling of early domestic radios as bulky pieces of furniture. In keeping with company founder E. K. Cole's view of radio as a modern medium, the geometric and unadorned design of the cabinets highlighted rather than disguised their essential componentsthe speaker and tuning knobs. EKCO was an early adopter of Bakelite, a synthetic plastic material that could be industrially molded, and approached several well-known modernist architects to design receivers suited to this modern technology. Plastics also made relatively lightweight, compact designs possible (the Chermayeff set was equipped with handles for portability).
