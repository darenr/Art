When this collage was first exhibited, the  left side was covered by an entire sheet from La Publicitat, a Barcelona newspaper. Later Miró ripped all but a small circle of the page from the composition. He left the edges of the collage elements in this work unglued, allowing them to curl above the composition’s surface to create palpable material depth. The colored papers have faded since the work was made, but upon viewing it in 1968,  Miró expressed appreciation for the effects of aging.
