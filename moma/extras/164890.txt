Fish Story, Sekula's magnum opus, underscores photography's role in labor history and in working class responses to globalization. The project has seven chapters, incorporating 105 color photographs, twenty-six black-and-white text panels, and two slide projections. Chapter One documents the central role of the sea in the modern global economy, bringing together images from the worldâ€™s port cities. The photographs constitute a unique record of unemployment and dilapidation in the old industrial powers, the capitalist pursuit of cheap labor around the globe, and the strenuous work of seafaring.
