This portfolio was printed in three variations. All the prints were made from one lithographic stone; Johns effaced and reworked it after drawing each numeral. Numerals are the most prevalent motif in Johnss works, present in nearly seventy paintings and sculptures, an equal number of drawings, and twentyâ€“five series of prints, as well as individual prints.
