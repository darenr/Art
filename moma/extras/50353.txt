This selection of works from diCorcia's Hustler series defines the cinematic turn photography took in the early 1990s. DiCorcia focused on men who had moved to Hollywood to seek their fortune only to find themselves working the Sunset Strip as prostitutes. He hired the men to pose in motel rooms or parking lots, outside gas stations, or simply lying on street corners. Each portrait is labeled with the manâ€™s name, age, the city he came from, and the amount of money he was paid for posing for the picture (from twenty to fifty dollars), which corresponds to the fees the subjects charged for their more typical services.
