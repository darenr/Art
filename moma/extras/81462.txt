Resting against the wall, Bound Square evokes a painting before it is hung. Of this sculpture, Winsor has said, "I came at it as a painter. You never lose that." Her use of simple shapes and rugged materials is not aimed at reducing form to its rudiments or counteracting the gestural quality of Abstract Expressionism, but rather is designed "to bring you back to yourself, to not refer you to another time or place or person, but to quietly hold you in an inviting stillness until the piece's presence and certainty is yours."
