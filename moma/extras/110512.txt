In 1943 Picasso met Fran√ßoise Gilot, a young aspiring painter; she moved in with him in 1946. This was an optimistic time of renewal in France, after the end of World War II, and the couple's early years together, spent mostly in the South of France, seem to have been idyllic. The couple separated in 1953. Gilot returned to Paris with their two children, who were born in 1947 and 1948.To create lines in white rather than the usual black, Picasso spread ink across the surface of his printing plate instead of pushing it into the incised lines of his composition.
