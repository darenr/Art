After gouging the woodblock to create the figure of his model, Fränzi, Heckel then sawed it into pieces, inked the components separately in red and black, and finally reassembled them like a jigsaw before printing. Heckel’s flat, angular rendering of Fränzi’s adolescent body and her exaggerated masklike features were influenced by his interest in African sculpture.
