Stacking Dinnerware is one of the most successful product designs of the Massimo and Lella Vignelli design studio. It takes advantage of the lightness and flexibility of melamine resin and can be stored as a compact group. The manufacturer Heller introduced the award-winning design to America in a range of colors. Massimo Vignelli is an architect-designer known for his graphic design, including the 1966â€“70 subway map and sign system for the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority. After studying in Milan and Venice, he and his wife, Lella, also an architect, established the Vignelli Office of Design and Architecture, followed by Vignelli Associates in 1971.
