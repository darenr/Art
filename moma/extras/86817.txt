Jongerius has gained notoriety for fusing industry and craft, high and low technology, and tradition and contemporary design. On a trip to Africa, Jongerius encountered a classic three-legged stool crafted by a carpenter from Kasese, Uganda. Inspired, she created a new seat that captures the character of the original, transforming a traditional African design into a folding chair, made of light, high-tech material.
