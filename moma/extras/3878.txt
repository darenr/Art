Vola is a customizable system of plumbing fittings meant for both the kitchen and bathroom. Organized around a single valve unit that adjusts water temperature and volume in one movement, the modular scheme includes wall plates, spouts, and interchangeable accessories, including paper towel holder, toothbrush holder, soap dish, and even an ashtray. Though the design was finished in bright primary colors popular in the 1960s, the concept of designing multipurpose utilities was by this time well established.
