The buildup of vapors underground can affect the performance of a manhole cover. To address this situation, engineers from Con Edison, the private utility that delivers electricity, gas, and steam service to the New York metropolitan area, set out to design a cover that would allow for ventilation, keep electrical cables and gas and steam pipelines hidden, withstand heavy traffic vibrations, minimize water entry, and prevent excess accumulation of street debris. Weighing nearly three hundred pounds, the new manhole cover allows for twenty-six percent of the surface area to be open for ventilation.
