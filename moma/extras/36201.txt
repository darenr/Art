For the 1976 Byrd Hoffman Foundation/Festival d'Avignon production (premiere Avignon, France). Music by Philip Glass. Choreography by Andrew de Groat and Lucinda Childs. Directed by Robert Wilson This drawing was made in preparation for Wilson's opera Einstein on the Beach. The four-and-a-half-hour-long piece consists of scenes loosely relating to Albert Einstein's personal life and scientific achievements. Wilson's high-contrast drawing foregrounds luminosity as a central preoccupation of the production, both as a metaphor for knowledge and as the potential, blinding result of Einstein's theories. The spaceship rendered here was the idea of the production's composer, Philip Glass, who said, "My music sounds to me like the motor of a spaceship, so I said I wanted a spaceship in the opera."
