Isolated fragments of displaced body parts juxtaposed with collage elements and geometric planes of color comprise this unconventional military portrait. The "reservist" refers to an army-trained officer under the age of forty-three, who, like the artist, was liable to be called up in the event of war. A dominant blue square floats in place of the face one might expect. For Malevich, the form of the square embodied physical and spiritual qualities: "The square is not a subconscious form. It is the creation of intuitive reason. It is the face of the new art."
