At first glance, Raad's grid of prints appears to be an organized series of abstract shapes. In fact, the forms are isolated clouds of dust and debris cut from a larger picture.  The smoke is the visual aftereffect of violence, bloodlessly capturing the bomb explosions that were so prevalent in Radd's homeland of Lebanon in 2006. The full source images—presumably more graphic—taken by amateurs and media outlets, are eliminated; Raad leaves only the clouds of smoke as a poetic yet powerful documentation of political violence.
