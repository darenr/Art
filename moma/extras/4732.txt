DO NOT PUBLISH. SIMILAR TO DESIGNING MODERN WOMEN
In 1911 the Ironrite Ironer Company began manufacturing electric ironing machines and marketing them to American housewives as the modern antidote to the drudgery of hand-ironing. In the late 1930s it launched the Health Chair, which facilitated "a scientifically correct ironing posture," to complement its machines. World War II delayed mass production of the chair but stimulated the development of a newly scientific and systematic analysis of the interface between the human body and the designed environment. When production resumed, the benefits of the Health Chair were advocated by Ironrite instructors, who provided free demonstrations at “ironing schools” as well as in private home lessons.
