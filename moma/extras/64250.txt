With this expansive work, Spero unfurls a stirring call to action. Arms thrown open and legs in full stride, four female figures sprint across the nine–foot–wide sheet of paper as a crowd of companions, signified by floating heads, joins in the chase. "To the revolution!" the title exclaims, in a propelling rallying cry for upheaval and reform.Both artist and activist, Spero creates daring images that address abuses of power throughout history, particularly the subjugation of women. She made her first political works, incorporating a mix of iconography from ancient cultures and the contemporary world, in the early 1960s. A decade later Spero completely eliminated male figures in her art, determined, in her words, "to see what it means to view the world through the depiction of women."In To the Revolution XI, as in other pieces, Spero takes cues from Asian scroll painting and Greek processional friezes, physically pulling the viewer along her storyline through the staccato repetition of images. Stamped on the sheet using a metal letterpress plate and earthy tones, the duplicated female figure is based on an ancient aboriginal design. Borrowing from the past, this banner conveys a sense of urgency and empowerment applicable to the revolutions of the present.
