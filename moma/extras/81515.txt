Morris helped to define the principles of Minimalism with his art and writings, but by the late 1960s he had tempered its often severe, geometrical appearance with softer, organic materials, thus becoming a founder of what is known as Postâ€“Minimalism, too.  Felt, copper tubing, asphalt, steel cable, lead, and double-sided mirrors punctuate this amorphous mass of thread waste, remnants from textile manufacturing.  Morris deliberately relinquished much of his artistic control to the materials themselves, writing, "Chance is accepted and indeterminacy is implied."
