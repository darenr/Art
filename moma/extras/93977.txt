Despite widespread campaigns to inform the general public about the importance of condom use in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV), their use in South Africa is still alarmingly low. One of the most often quoted reasons for not using them is that their painstaking application interferes with the sexual act. This cheap, fast, and innovative packaging, no bigger than the usual condom casing, allows the product to be unwrapped and fitted in three seconds, while at the same time protecting it from unhygienic handling. The applicator is sealed into a foil pouch together with the condom. When bent, the foil splits open on the correct side, and the applicator pops up and slides the condom out.
