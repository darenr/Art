Gillick is known for his installations and sculptures that investigate the signs and symbols of corporate office architecture. One of his recurring themes is "flex" time in the workplace, and he considers this series, he says, to be a sort of "guide to the working week." Each of the five screenprints includes the German word for a different day of the week (Monday through Friday), but they are presented out of order. The labyrinthine network of geometric patterns may suggest the "rat race" of corporate working life.
