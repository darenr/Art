Sarpaneva's cast-iron casserole has become an iconic work of organic design. It is one of several objects that represent his interest in multipurpose kitchenwares that could be used in the oven, on the stovetop, and at the table (sometimes also in the refrigerator). The teak handle allows one-handed transportation and, when removed, inserts into the lid for opening. Along with contemporaries such as Kaj Franck and Tappio Wirkkala, Sarpaneva achieved international fame as postwar Finnish design grew in popularity due to its clean and warm modern forms, often inspired by nature as well as traditional decorative arts.
