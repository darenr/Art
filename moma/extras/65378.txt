In the 1930s Picasso made a series of one hundred prints, commissioned by publisher Ambroise Vollard and now known as the Vollard Suite. The series includes prints on various subjects, but the sculptor's studio is the most prominent. Among these is a group depicting a sculpted head resembling several that Picasso created inspired by his lover, Marie–Thérèse Walter. Many of these etchings include a female figure, also resembling Walter, who served as the artist's model and muse.
