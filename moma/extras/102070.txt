This piece grew out of Horn's early fascination with stained glass windows and her subsequent training in glassmaking. It was cast from the highly refined and completely transparent optical glass used for manufacturing lenses and prisms. The title, which Horn intends to act as "an entrance to something but never an explanation," refers to the legendary vocalist Aretha Franklin.
