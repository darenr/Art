Book of Creation, one of three books Pape produced between 1959 and 1962, is considered a prime example of early Neoâ€“Concrete art. Consisting of fifteen unbound cardboard "pages," the book tells the story of the creation of the world through an elaborate, abstract composition composed of geometric forms. The book does not retell a specific creation myth, but invites each viewer to create his or her own narrative by "reading" and interpreting each page. Starting with the recession of water and continuing through the development of agriculture, fire, hunting, time, navigation, the solar system, and light, Pape reinforces an open reading with various adaptations and configurations. She said, "Through each person's experiences there is a process of open structure through which each structure can generate its own meaning."
