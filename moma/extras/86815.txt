Long Scroll is a kind of portrait of the artist, a Chinese expatriate living in France. In the early 1980s, while Huang was studying traditional techniques in Hangzhou, China, information about modern Western art became accessible for the first time in decades. Influenced by this influx, Huang began to make conceptually based artwork, and in 1986 he helped found the radical art group Xiamen Dada. Taking the form of a traditional Chinese scroll, this work is a nonhierarchical inventory of images relating to the artist’s career and wide range of influences. In one section, Huang alludes to his 1997 sculpture Thousand-Armed Guanyin, a work that connects two culturally distinct objects: the many-armed Buddhist figure Guanyin and the pronged readymade Bottlerack (1914), by Marcel Duchamp, a key figure of the twentieth-century avant-garde. Two colors—blue and orange—circulate throughout the piece and are occasionally combined, a coloristic mixing that is suggestive of cultural dichotomies that are variously merged and reconfigured.
