Lightweeds are living digital organisms. They grow indoors but depend on sunshine, rainfall, and wind measured in the outside world through sensors placed on the outer walls of the building (these Lightweeds are responding to information captured by sensors just outside the Museum.) As human traffic—yes, you—goes by, they bend, lose their seeds, and pollinate other walls throughout the space in a constantly evolving wallpaper that reflects the character of the space and its use.
