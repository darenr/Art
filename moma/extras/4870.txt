Although Mackintosh had no formal training in the design of lithographic posters, in the mid-1890s he produced several, including this design for The Scottish Musical Review, printed in four sections. Human, plant, and bird forms are integrated into abstract patterns illustrating Symbolist themes of spiritual transformation, decay and renewal, day and night. The unconventional stylization of the androgynous figure owed much to the experimental approach that Mackintosh shared with the rest of the Glasgow group known as the Four, comprising his wife, Margaret Macdonald; her sister, Frances Macdonald; and Frances’s husband, Herbert MacNair. The analogy with music—a model of synthetic unity—was a major theme in critical writing about the New Art.
