In Endless Nude, fluid, anthropomorphic forms merge with the surrounding landscape. Projecting up from the ground or swirling overhead, these figures seem not to be bound by earthly forces.  Matta referred to such compositions as "inscapes"—landscapes as projections of interior activity—and coined the term "psychological morphology" to describe their forms. Interested in life on both micro and macroscopic scales, he created a counterpoint between cellular organisms and fleshy limbs. His dynamic compositions came to the attention of Surrealist leader André Breton in 1937; the following year, when this drawing was executed, Matta's work was included in the International Exhibition of Surrealism in Paris.
