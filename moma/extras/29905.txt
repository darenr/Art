In 1935, during a period of turmoil in his personal life, Picasso gave up painting for about a year and began writing poetry. Between 1935 and 1959 he wrote some 340 poems. These examples from 1941  appear in his handwriting; he made the text and image arrangements later. Picasso's stream-of-consciousness writing style, filled with outrageous juxtapositions, was much appreciated by the Surrealists.
