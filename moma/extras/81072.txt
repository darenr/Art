High on the wall and decidedly out of reach, a barred window reveals an illusory glimpse of radiant blue sky. Gober transforms the gallery into a prison cell, taunting viewers with the semblance of a landscape beyond and provoking a desire to escape. At once familiar and uncanny, Gober's work is based on memory: "Most of my sculptures have been memories remade, recombined, and filtered through my current experiences." This sculptural installation also alludes to the Renaissance conception of a painting as a window, once the premise of representational picture-making.
