Creed stipulates that this seven-part drawing should be arranged in an order that gives "the illusion of randomness." Equality among colors, materials, works of art, and actions is of utmost importance to the artist, who numbers his works sequentially rather than giving them individual titles. Though Creed has filled each of these standard-sized sheets with ink of a single color, variation is nonetheless apparent in the multitude of horizontal pen strokes that make visible the repetitive motion of his gestures. To Creed, "rhythm, whether musical or visual, is a comfort. Its like putting up a ruler, or a grid, against the world, so that the changing world, messy as it is, can be made into a patternâ€”like looking at a garden through a fence."
