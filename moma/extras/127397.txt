The composer Ichiyanagi became an important part of the New York avant-garde music scene in the late 1950s and early 1960s in the circle around John Cage, Yoko Ono, and George Maciunas. He performed in the La Monte Young and Yoko Ono series at Ono’s Chambers Street loft and at Maciunas’s AG Gallery in 1961. On his return to Japan, Ichiyanagi and Ono toured with Cage during his 1962 concert series. With Kuniharu Akiyama, Ichiyanagi organized the influential International Graphic Scores Exhibition in 1962 at Minami Gallery, Tokyo, which Cage attended. The 1960 score IBM for Merce Cunningham is based on early IBM computer cards.
