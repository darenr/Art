In 1969 Huebler stated, "The world is full of objects, more or less interesting; I do not wish to add any more. I prefer, simply, to state the existence of things in terms of time and/or place." The Conceptual artist began Variable Piece #70: Global 81 two years later with the aim of documenting every living person before his death. The innumerable images he amassed were primarily of people in public situations, such as this group of marching soldiers. He also individualized them in painted interpretations of their faces without helmets. Huebler then categorized each grouping with a description that cannot be attributed to any one particular individual in the imageâ€”in this case, "AT LEAST ONE PERSON WHO HAS EVERYTHING TO GAIN AND NOTHING TO LOSE."
