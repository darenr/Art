This book's long, accordionâ€“folded format captures the forward rhythm of a procession. Kentridge assembled torn black paper on unbound pages of a French dictionary (c. 1906) to make the first volume. To produce the edition, the paper fragments were replicated using metal templates and affixed to additional dictionary pages.
