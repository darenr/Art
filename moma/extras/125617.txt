The Less Lamp is a sealed egg that must be broken to release the light trapped within. The ultimate appearance and function of the lamp is controlled by the user, who cracks the “shell” with a specially designed hammer. The active participation of the user allows for customization of the lamp based on how much light is required and where it is to be directed. However, as Canudas warns, once it’s broken there is no going back.
