The House of the Hanged Man, with its rough, geometric wooden form, is representative of William Tucker's works from the early 1980s, occupying a great deal of space with a small amount of surface area. The hanged man of the title is nowhere to be found; rather, the sculpture serves as a stage for his implied presence.
