Deschenes engages creatively with the relationships between abstraction and representation and the uniquely handmade and the mechanically reproducible. Among her experimental photograms—cameraless photographs made by placing objects directly on photosensitive paper and exposing it to light—is Moiré #25. To create this work, the artist took a sheet of perforated paper, placed it against a well–lit window, and recorded two exposures on eight-by-ten-inch black-and-white negatives. She then superimposed the two negatives slightly off-kilter on an enlarger. Printed on color photographic paper, the final image features a unique moiré pattern and a startlingly vibrant optical effect.
