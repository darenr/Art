The left panel of Muscular Paper depicts a photograph by French photographer Brassaï of Pablo Picasso’s 1931 sculpture Bather. The center panel includes a doubled likeness of a head from the painting The Club-Footed Boy (1642), by Spanish painter Jusepe de Ribera, and the right panel replicates a bridge from a print by the German Expressionist artist Max Beckmann. Superimposed on these explicit references are nonspecific and seemingly unrelated images and patterns, which compete for prominence and suggest multiple and shifting meanings. Salle has claimed independence for his art from the system of logic that governs the real: “I do think that there are things that exist in the world that relate to one another. And then there are things in my paintings that relate to one another. And I think what matters to me is that these are not the same.”
