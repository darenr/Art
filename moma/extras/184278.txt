The DIY Gamer Kit allows users to build their own handheld gaming console and either code their own game or download games from an online library. Technology Will Save Us produces several DIY kits focused on topics such as music, play, gardening, and cycling, inserting skills like coding and soldering into enjoyable daily activities. These objects reflect the deep and central role technology and interface design now play in our everyday lives, and the new importance of “maker culture”—technology-oriented, often grassroots, craft initiatives—in the design landscape.
