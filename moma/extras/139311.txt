Commissioned for exclusive use by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Walker is versatile enough to be used by the museum's in-house graphic designers for all of the institution's diverse programming needs and yet is instantly and reliably recognizable as part of an image and brand. Walker is a sans-serif typeface with optional serifs for certain letters, special ligatures, joining strokes, and a flexible underlining system. By incorporating all these options, Carter created one of the very first interactive and mutable typefaces, a groundbreaking achievement not only in typography but also in branding and image design.
