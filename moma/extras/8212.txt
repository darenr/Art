In this photocollage, created to raise awareness about hunger, Kémeny (a Holocaust survivor) and Sós (her husband) juxtaposed deprivation and comfort through images of starving children and a healthy girl with her pampered pet. Such graphics often blur the boundary between global aid and commercialism, with designers drawing on the conventions of one to enhance the impact of the other.
