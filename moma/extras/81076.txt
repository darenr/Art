Much of Gonzalez-Torres's work addresses personal and political dimensions of the AIDS crisis, which hit the arts community in New York City with particular ferocity. The title of this work may refer both to the United States Supreme Court's 1986 decision upholding the right of states to criminalize homosexual acts and to the political power of the Moral Majority, a Christian-right organization active in the USA in the 1980s. Here, Gonzalez-Torres plays with the austere formal language of Minimalism, transforming a commonplace material—paper, curled into sharply pointed cones—into an arrangement that suggests both fragility and menace.
