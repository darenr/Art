Here are the cantos, eighteen of them, each one different in form, mood, color, beat, scale, and key. There are no cadenzas. Each is separate. Each can stand by itself. But its fullest meaning it seems to me, is when it is seen together with the others.â€”Barnett Newman, "Preface to 18 Cantos," 1964
