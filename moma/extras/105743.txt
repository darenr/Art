Cucullu is best known for large-scale installations of wall drawings made with watercolor paint and sticky contact paper, among other materials. Like those works, this print portfolio juxtaposes representational fragments and abstract elements with imagery derived from a wide range of sources, including the political history of Argentina, traditions of revolution and protest, marginalized historical figures, literary references, pop culture, and the artist's own personal recollections. The result is a unique combination of personal and universal, "high" and "low" subject matter. Here the artist factors in a participatory component, allowing the sheets to be installed in various ways, a process that he believes will create new narratives and perspectives.
