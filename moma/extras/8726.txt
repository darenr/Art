This poster and the play it advertises transform ordinary people into absurdly grotesque and enigmatic figures. To capture the play's tragicomic feel, Lenica drew inspiration from the witty and macabre collages by the German Surrealist artist Max Ernst. Set in the town of Güllen ("liquid shit" in Swiss dialect), Dürrenmatt's famous play deals with the helplessness and corruptibility of the individual in society as an entire community eventually succumbs to murdering one of its members out of sheer greed. While this production ran in Warsaw the same play opened on Broadway, mesmerizing audiences on either side of the Iron Curtain.
