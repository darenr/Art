The Surrealists of the 1920s and '30s played a game they called "exquisite corpse," a collaborative activity in which each individual would add to a drawing or text without seeing the contributions of the other participants. The surprising results were thought to reveal the subconscious. A longâ€“time member of the Surrealist group, Tanning continued to use the technique in work she did alone, here by cutting etchings into strips to allow for the mixing of parts.
