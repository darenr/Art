In the 1950s, commercial artists often sent promotional mailings of their graphic work to art directors in an attempt to gain new commissions. Warhol's promotional books—handmade and personalized—often felt more like gifts. He sent A Gold Book at Christmas in 1957, and this copy is dedicated to Russell Lynes, an editor at Harper's. He traced most of these drawings from photographs.
