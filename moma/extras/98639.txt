Lucas is part of a generation known as Young British Artists (YBAs) that came to attention in the 1990s for their often sensational subject matter.  Many of Lucas's works contain frank sexual content and crudely juxtapose everyday materials. They also often blur masculinity and femininity.  The artist has said, "I like to play around with gender stereotypes. And I like androgyny."
