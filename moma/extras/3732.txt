The Formula 1 Racing Car is designed for a single purpose: to win the Grand Prix, a series of sixteen races held each season in different parts of the world. Incorporating state-of-the-art technology and engineering, the carâ€™s body and engine are designed using a size/weight/materials formula within which the designer may exploit any mechanical or aerodynamic advantage to improve the car's prospect for victory. The car's shape is largely determined by exhaustive wind-tunnel studies; the silhouette allows air to pass over the body with minimal drag and maximal down-force, ensuring precision handling even at speeds over two hundred miles per hour. This Formula 1 car, the Ferrari 641,can withstand lateral forces of up to 4 G on turns. It has a carbon fiber composite chassis, a 3.5-liter V-12 engine, a curb weight of 1,105 pounds, and a top speed of 215 miles per hour. It made its debut in 1990 and, in the hands of legendary drivers Alain Prost of France and Nigel Mansell of England, won six races and nearly triumphed at the World Championship.
