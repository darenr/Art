GROW, a hybrid-energy delivery device, was inspired by ivy. Its “leaves” are flexible photovoltaic panels that generate solar power; their fluttering generates wind power. The designers have utilized recycled and reclaimed materials wherever possible, and, at the end of GROW’s lifespan, sustainable methods of recycling and reclamation will minimize its environmental footprint.
