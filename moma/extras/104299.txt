Brandt often reused photographs, re-titling and dating them to suit new contexts. For example, in his 1966 book Shadow of Light, Brandt titled this photograph Race-goers at Sandown Park, grouping it with other pictures in the section “London Before the War”—even though he had taken the picture at the Auteuil racetrack in Paris. Brandt regularly photographed spectators at various events in England throughout the 1930s.
