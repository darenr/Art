Edmunds, a sculptor known for his labor-intensive, methodical approach to found objects, also experiments with the systematic processes of printmaking. Here a single uninterrupted line is a pulsating, hypnotic meditation on the process of incising a linoleum block. The print was commissioned by Johannesburg-based artist and curator Clive van den Berg, who organized a series of annual exhibitions, titled Self (2000â€“2002), that explored oversize linocut printing by artists who had rarely or never used the technique before.
