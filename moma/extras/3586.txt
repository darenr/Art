Knotted Chair, designed by Wanders for the Dutch design collective Droog Design, is an adaptation of macramé, a technique of knotting thread or cord to create a textile similar to coarse lace. The chair is a product of Droog’s collaboration with the faculty of aviation at Delft Technical University in the investigation of new materials and fabrication techniques. To make the chair, cords composed of aramid fibers—a strong and lightweight heat-resistant material commonly used in aerospace—twisted around a carbon core are knotted together by hand before being draped over a mold. The soft net is then infused with epoxy resin and dried to harden the textile and set the chair’s shape.
