Blauvelt created some eight hundred drawings in the 1940s and 1950s. She drew on looseâ€“leaf notebook paper and on found materials, appropriating images from shopping catalogues or illustrating the furniture, clothing, and architecture of her everyday life. She infused these depictions with her own flattened perspective and organized her selections through careful classification, enhanced by a methodical layering of line.
