Focusing on the natural world in his art, Penone explores concepts of growth and regeneration through sculpture, interventions, and imprints that transfer the image of body parts or the textures of natural elements onto paper. Here he has made a rubbing from planks of wood. Penone has said, "I feel the forest breathing and hear the slow, inexorable growth of the wood."
