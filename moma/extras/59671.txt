This monumental photoetching is composed of eight sheets of paper individually framed and stacked twenty feet high. Acconci photographed a section of an aluminum ladder and repeatedly printed it to create this towering image. Ladders were a recurring motif in the artistâ€™s work in the late 1970s and often underscored how space can be manipulated and made to appear endless through repetition. As the title suggests, this work can be installed on a wall of any height, because it adapts to the surrounding architecture. The life-size scale invites viewers to imagine climbing the ladder and escaping their surroundings.
