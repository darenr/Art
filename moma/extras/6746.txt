Elegant, controlled, and austere, this poster marks the ultimate expression of principles Tschichold had refined over a decade: "I attempt to reach the maximum of purpose in my publicity works and to connect the single constructive elements harmoniouslyâ€”to design," he wrote. The poster's subtle composition draws on the characteristics of the Constructivist art exhibition it advertises. By 1937 Tschichold had fled Nazi Germany, where such art was characterized as degenerate, and was living in Switzerland. This poster was one of several he designed for the museum in the absence of commissions from commercial clients.
