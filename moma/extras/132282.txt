Super Clamp has screw-operated jaws that can be fixed to poles, trees, and shelves and can hold anything from lights and props to screens. It has an ergonomic lever to securely lock the clamping position as well as a secondary safety-lock system that holds items in place even if the screw lock loosens or comes undone.
