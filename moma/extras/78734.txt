Felix Fénéon was an art dealer, collector, curator, political activist, critic, and friend of Signac who shared the artist's interests in science and  Japanese prints. In this painting Signac depicts  this unconventional and enigmatic personality  with his characteristic goatee, holding a top hat and a walking stick in one hand and a flower in the other. Combining figuration and abstraction, he sets Fénéon's static profile against a swirling background—a kaleidoscopic depiction of optical theorist Charles Henry's recently published color wheel. A similar playfulness underlies the exceedingly long title, possibly a spoof on scientific terminology.
