Knorr was co-awarded first prize in the Seating Units category for this side chair. Described as "light, flexible, and elegant," it features a curved seat cut from sheet metal and designed to conform to the human body. Its simple shape and fixtures facilitate easy manufacture and storage, and it is finished with flexible paint to prevent cracking. Knorr has a background in architecture, and after serving in the United States Navy in World War II he pursued graduate studies at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan. He worked at the prestigious architectural firms of Saarinen, Saarinen & Associates and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill before establishing his own practice in San Francisco in 1951.
