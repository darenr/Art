Roller, a graphic designer, was a member of the Vienna Secession. This group of young Austrian artists had defected from the nation’s oldest artistic society in a rejection of its conservatism and was committed to the unification of different art forms through a holistic aesthetic. The Secession held a series of exhibitions, including one honoring composer Ludwig van Beethoven, for which Roller made this poster. Under the direction of architect and designer Josef Hoffmann, twenty–one artists collaborated on the installation, which was one of the Secession’s greatest public successes, drawing nearly sixty thousand visitors. The bold, condensed lettering in Roller’s design is also a feature of other posters and journal covers he designed around this time. The main figure, a bowed woman presenting a symbolic sphere of light, is near life size. She belongs to a family of similar figures common in modern architecture and design of this period.
