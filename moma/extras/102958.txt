Jouin utilizes selective laser sintering (SLS), a particular type of 3-D printing, to produce the entire seating surface, legs, and hidden integral articulations of this stool in just one shot (hence the object’s name). With this stool’s array of rods and its simple, elegant twist—fabricated in one manufacturing step—Jouin has created an innovative seating typology.
