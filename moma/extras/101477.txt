Noland uses found objects in such a way that each retains its distinct identity and space. Metal poles, wire racks, leather straps from billy clubs, a pirate flag juxtaposed with an American flag, and a blind man's cane are assembled in The American Trip. These items are taken from life and point to the underbelly of the American psyche by creating counterpoint and tension through their juxtaposition. "I came from Washington DC, a city of facade," Noland says. "What's behind it? We're two-faced! I'm trying to break the facadeâ€”mix things up."
