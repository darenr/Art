During his tenure at the Bauhaus, Klee explored distinctive ways of imageâ€“making, including transfer drawings. This work was executed by tracing the lines of a pencil drawing through a black-inked surface onto another clean sheet of paper. The clean sheet received the outline of the drawing in black as well as additional smudges of excess pigment, to which Klee then directly added motifs in watercolor and ink. The arching and angled arrows, before which whimsical figures appear to dance, indicate motion and spatial depth. The reference to music, a mainstay in Klee's life and in his Bauhaus activities, is underscored by the word "scherzo," referring to a vigorous and playful composition, in the work's title.
