As a student at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, Kammerer won the triennial Rosenbaum Prize at the end of his second year, with this project for a royal hunting tent. Intended as a temporary ceremonial structure, the three-sided bamboo and canvas construction was designed to be a lavish representation of monarchy rather than a purely functional object. Kammerer's symbolic architectural language includes sculptural papyrus-leaf motifs and silk tapestries depicting hunting scenes lining the tent's interior. Stenciled patterning adorns the exterior walls. Kammerer was a student of the Austrian architect Otto Wagner, whose instruction in the incorporation of art, architecture, and design within a Gesamtkunstwerk—a “total work of art”—is evident in the aesthetic qualities of this meticulously wrought drawing. Kammerer went on to become a renowned painter and architect.
