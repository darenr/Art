"The main idea promoted by this project," Oxman says, “is our ability not only to analyze natural (and biological) tissues but to reconstruct them in larger scales.” Three microscale biological tissues (a leaf section, a butterfly wing, and a scorpion paw) were reconstructed using a digital protocol. The tissues were closely analyzed and then reconstructed in three-dimensional macroscale prototypes out of wood, through the use of a very fine mill controlled by a computer.
