Roth made each of his accumulation books with a different type of found material, which he gathered, trimmed to a uniform size, and bound; bok 3a is made from pages of a daily newspaper from Iceland (where Roth had a home). These books were issued in small editions, but each volume is unique, as the contents were dictated by what was available in the printshop at the time.
