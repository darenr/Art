Q-tips, ladders, plants and small appliances, toothpicks, and pills are among the dozens, even hundreds, of mundane objects that fill Sze's anything-but-mundane installations. Typically commissioned to fill a specific, often unusual, space—from entire galleries to closets, corners, and staircases—these meandering assemblages and environments celebrate the poetry of everyday life.Sze came into prominence in the late 1990s with her painstakingly engineered constructions. At that time she also started to experiment with printmaking, creating a delicate lithograph that related to her drawing style. In 2001 her printmaking expanded in both size and scope, beginning with this untitled print completed over two years. Sze's approach grew from her three-dimensional work; here she presents an imaginary universe that draws on her interest in the basic components of art and architecture (including scale, perspective, composition, and movement). Full of abstract elements and references to buildings and infrastructure, this monumental print creates a dynamic sense of motion when viewed at a distance and offers exhaustive narrative details upon a closer look. It was produced using a combination of printmaking techniques: screenprint for the flat areas of color, digital tools to reprocess aspects of preexisting work, and lithography for the hand-drawn linework.
