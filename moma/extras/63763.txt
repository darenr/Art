Situated at the tip of West Baffin Island, the community of Cape Dorset was the center of contemporary Inuit art during the 1950s. Artists such as Pootagook and Tudlik, members of the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative, developed printing techniques that originated in the traditional Inuit practices of incising into bone, carving in stone, and appliqueing animal skin. The artists' acute understanding of the natural world is manifest in the carefully observed and simply executed depictions of humans and animals.
