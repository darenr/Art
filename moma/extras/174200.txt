Google Maps is a popular Internet-based mapping program that offers not only street maps but also photographic views of city streets; directions for walking, driving, and hiking; routing options via public transportation; and business locations. It also powers many applications and services offered by third parties. The unique upside-down teardrop design of the Google Maps Pin was created to be both recognizable and functional, precisely indicating a location without obscuring the area nearby. This ubiquitous digital icon bleeds into real life in the work of artists such as Aram Bartholl, who creates physical Google Maps Pins to mark sites in the material world.
