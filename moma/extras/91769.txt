In 1946, Kosice, along with other Argentine artists, founded the MADI movement, one of the earliest artistic groups entirely devoted to nonobjective abstraction in the Americas. He began his landmark production of unconventional sculptural forms in the early 1940s. Inspired by the raw, nontraditional materials in the leather shop he owned with his brother, Kosice developed artworks that are in a permanent state of change.  This transformable sculpture is made from metal bands used to reinforce leather handbags. Intended to be touched and moved by the viewer, it defies the idea of sculpture as a static monument and exemplifies the primacy for MADI artists of peripheral, unconventional artistic structures, such as irregular, broken frames and forms without default positions. For conservation reasons, viewers are no longer allowed to manipulate the sculpture.
