Wright designed a playhouse encircled by a band of stained–glass windows as an addition to the suburban Chicago estate of the industrialist Avery Coonley. Composed of brightly colored geometric motifs, these windows suggest balloons, confetti, and flags. Wright described this prominent architectural element as a "kinder–symphony.” Mrs. Queene Ferry Coonley, like Wright’s mother and his first wife, Catherine, was drawn to the educational theories and “Gifts” of Friedrich Froebel, and she commissioned the playhouse as a kindergarten for her daughter and other neighborhood children.
