These seaweedlike plastic modular components snap together to form a screen, a room divider, a tentlike canopy, or any form to suit any space. The Algues Screen is available in several colors and the components attach at multiple points, allowing for endless combinations of organically branching structures: add more components for dense opacity or fewer for lacy transparency. The individual modules are easy to assemble and disassemble, pack up, and carry. These characteristics make the Bouroullec brothersâ€™ work well suited to mobility and flexibility, two conditions that characterize contemporary life.
