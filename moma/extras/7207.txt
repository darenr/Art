Although Lenica left Poland in 1963 to work in Paris and Berlin, he continued to accept commissions from the Polish state agencies. This poster advertising a German exhibition of Polish Surrealist art is indicative of Western European interest in the Polish art and design of the 1960s. Lenica's motif of brains in a bowler hat is a witty adaptation of imagery by Belgian artist Ren√© Magritte. It indicates the pervasive Polish fascination with Surrealism as well as the characteristic Central European emphasis on the concealed interior life of the individual.
