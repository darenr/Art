In 1990 Rothenberg moved to New Mexico, and the red earth of the landscape there led her to embrace color more actively. In Red Bamboo a disembodied head floats above a beautiful plane of green hatchings slashed by a dramatic red pole. Playing with perspective, as she often does—here suggesting a bird's-eye view—Rothenberg creates a disorienting sense of space and a palpable tension between foreground and background elements.
