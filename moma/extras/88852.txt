Woods is an architect who uses the sketch as a form of investigation, often devoting a series of drawings to the development of a single idea. Not intended for realization, the forms described in his drawings are speculative departures from current architectural production. They reveal Woodsâ€™s concern with an architecture that is able to conceive of what he has called "new types of space." Following his interest in the potential of storms, earthquakes, and sociopolitically disruptive events to inspire new architecture, Woods invents dynamic forms in response to rapidly changing contemporary urban cultures and environments. He depicts fields of expansive energy through extremely dense, dark accumulations of acutely angled lines and shapes that fill the entire page with artificial landscapes and border terrains, offering a critique of the existing architectural landscape by planting the seed for a cultural and material alternative.
