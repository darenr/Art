Made the year Flavin began to use commercially available fluorescent light tubes, this work marries color and light, bringing them into three dimensions. In dialogue with the surrounding space, the vertical pink tube simultaneously illuminates and obscures the cornerâ€”a location not typically used for displaying art. Though the light emitted transcends its physical encasement and transforms the surrounding space, Flavin rejected any characterization of his work as sublime. "One might not think of light as a matter of fact, but I do," he stated. "And it is...as plain and open and direct an art as you will ever find." This work is dedicated to the artist Jasper Johns, who similarly blurred boundaries between real objects and their representation.
