The iPod, a portable hard drive initially used exclusively as an MP3 player, exponentially expanded the typical capacity of a music device: it was significantly smaller, cleaner, and more intuitive than any similar player at the time of its release in 2001. The device's data and its power supply are administered and transferred through a USB cord to a base computer or other power outlet, thus eliminating the need for any collateral, detachable parts besides the earphones. The first-generation iPod has substantially influenced the quality and elegance not only of portable music devices, but of electronic products in general.
