The drawing Lebensmittel (1 Tüte) belongs to Immendorff's "Lidl" activities—a series of politically charged performances and environments that commenced with Immendorff's arrest in January 1968 after appearing in front of the parliament building in Bonn dragging a small wooden block painted in the colors of the German flag from his ankle. Soon after, he and his friends opened the student–run, professor–free Lidl Academy, which offered classes for children and performances for visitors.
