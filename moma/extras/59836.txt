Decoy highlights Johns's persistent theme of memory, presenting an amalgam of his former imagery—the ale can in the center, the frieze of his sculptures along the bottom, and color words and body fragments from an earlier print. Johns juxtaposes hand–drawn passages with photographic depictions, a feature made significantly simpler by his use here, for the first time, of ULAE's offset press.
