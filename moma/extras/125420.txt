This is one of several posters Lenica designed for films directed by the Polish expatriate Roman PolanÂ´ski. The cartoonish figures capture the grimly funny spirit of Cul-de-sac and reflect Lenica's own aesthetic strategies as an animator. Speaking at MoMA in 1974, he explained, "For animation, paper cuts and collage are the best. Drawing in animation has no character, it is too anonymous. I make it as simply as possible." The poster was awarded a Special Prize in 1973 at the First International Film Poster Competition in Cannes.
