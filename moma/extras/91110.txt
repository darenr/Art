Let There Be Fashion, Down with Art ironically inverts the Latin saying: "Let there be art, down with fashion," thus announcing the end of traditional art. Here the rational world of science and industry have gone awry: the prints display a diagrammatic drawing technique, nonsensical equations, ineffectual measuring instruments, and a dysfunctional system of plumbs and weights. The portfolio also marks the first appearance of the artist’s assumed Dada identity, "Dadamax ERNST," which supplants the artist’s signature on the second sheet. The fourth image in the sequence is inscribed with the words "DaDa NoBis," and below, "PACIS" written backwards—a play on the Latin hymn Dona Nobis Pacem (Give us peace).
