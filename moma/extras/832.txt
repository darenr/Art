This is one of a number of works by Pesce—made for The Museum of Modern Art’s 1972 exhibition Italy: The New Domestic Landscape—that present a third-millennium archeologist’s discovery of an underground southern alpine city from a hundred years earlier. The drawing illustrates an age in which people have settled in various underground pockets, drained of mineral oils and water and sealed off from the outside world by large stones. These “archeological remains” are meant to reflect essential conditions for living, such as “the exploitation of the interior of the planet,” “the importance of space,” “the necessity of isolation,” and “noncommunication as characteristic of human life.” The house is the subject of psychoanalytical and philosophical inquiry that discloses hidden political shades in its direct, if fictional, reflection of life.
