During his first concentrated study of lithography, Winters completed a series of three works based on the morula, the spherical mass of cells that forms from a newly fertilized egg. He drew the embryonic masses in layers of velvety blacks that create a remarkably lush and painterly surface. Atmospheric smears of ink create an indeterminate space and suggest an environment of suspension for the organic orbs.
