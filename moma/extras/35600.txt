As in a musical score, the passage of time is symbolically represented in a movement from left to right in the drawing's extended horizontal format that was partly influenced by Chinese scroll painting. At the suggestion of Italian composer Ferruccio Busoni, Richter had listened to J.S. Bach in order to explore the musical concept of counterpointthat is the harmonic composition of two or more simultaneous melodies. The interlocked shapes of this drawing are arranged on varying levels much like the upper or lower voices in a fugue.
