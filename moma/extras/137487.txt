This work is one of Weiner’s earliest in which “language + the materials referred to” appears as the medium. As presented in the artist’s “Statement of Intent” in the publication January 5–31, 1969, the realization of the work can take the form of the presentation of language—the text that defines the work—or the execution of the language of the work through material installation. The two possibilities of presentation are equally accurate to the specifications of the text—Gloss white lacquer, sprayed for 2 minutes at 40lb pressure directly on the floor—yet when the work is physically installed, its manifestation is variable.
