Reichek draws on the tradition of embroidered samplers to create Conceptual, word-based art. Replacing traditional aphorisms, prayers, and educational texts with quotations from art history and mythology, Reichek painstakingly replicated images of three black abstract paintings and a statement by the artist Ad Reinhardt, her painting teacher. On the right are lines spoken by Penelope in The Odyssey, by Homer, and a design from a Greek vase depicting women making textiles. The artist has explained, "Reinhardt described artmaking very much as Penelope described weaving her tapestry: as a constant process of making and remaking, beginning and beginning again."
