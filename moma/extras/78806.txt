The imagery in this work, executed following a trip to Northern Italy and Sicily in 1931, may be related to the historical built structures Klee encountered on his travels, while its formal elements are akin to the early Christian and Byzantine mosaics he likely also saw. Like the colored tesserae that compose a mosaic, the small strokes of muted color that cover this canvas remain independent on the white ground while together they subtly evoke vegetation and architectural formsâ€”gabled roofs, turrets, and walls.
