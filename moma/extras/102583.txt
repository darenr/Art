This installation documents the preparations for the January 2003 World Economic Forum, in which the entire valley of Davos, Switzerland, was temporarily transformed into a high-security zone. In the period leading up to the forum, Spinatsch installed three remote-controlled cameras outside different buildings. One was programmed to record up to 2,500 images over three hours, from 6:35 to 9:30 A.M., while slowly rotating vertically and horizontally. Spinatsch assembled the shots in a high-resolution panorama that shows random moments captured frame by frame as well as the transition from dawn to early morning. Instead of a photojournalistic account of the event, the artist presents the leadup to the forum, revealed as meticulously planned and tightly controlled.
