Wall House 2 (A. E. Bye House) is the second in a series of visionary projects that John Hejduk began in the mid-1960s to explore what he deemed the first principles of architecture. As with the first in the series, he used the wall to reinterpret the traditional configuration of the house in his design for the landscape architect Arthur Edward Bye. Each functional component (or room) is isolated from every other one, and all but one (the study) are stacked adjacent to the same wall. Thus, the wall becomes a dividing element, which must be passed through on leaving or entering a room, as well as a unifying element, which binds them. The separate function of each room is reinforced by its color: green reflects the nourishment of dining, yellow the energy of cooking, and gray the realm of reflection. Originally designed in 1973–76 for a site in Connecticut, the Bye House was eventually built in Gröningen, the Netherlands, in 2001.
