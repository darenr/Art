The title of this work is the Paris address from which the artist removed these torn movie posters and political notices (related to the city’s May 1968 student and worker demonstrations). He pasted the layers of fragmentary color, words, and images onto canvas. This work is exemplary of Nouveau Réalisme, a European movement of the 1950s and 1960s devoted to transforming everyday objects into art.
