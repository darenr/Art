Living in Europe in the 1910s, Xul Solar had direct contact with Italian Futurists and German Expressionists. He also became acquainted with various hermetic and occultist traditions, which led him to esotericism, astrology, and divinatory practices. In Argentina during the 1940s and 1950s, Xul Solar delved into the vast world of imaginary toys and plays, combining cabalistic ciphers, words, and hermetic phonemes. In this piece of the midâ€“1940s, Xul Solar's interest in theater, marionettes, and hexagram elements from the I Ching combine in an enigmatic and beautiful ensemble of objects. They anticipate works produced by the Fluxus movement of the 1960s, which focused on language, formless art, and actions from everyday life.
