Kenyan-born artist Wangechi Mutu's collage pays tribute to Funmilayo Anikulapoâ€“Kuti, the mother of the famous Afrobeat musician Fela Kuti. A pioneering feminist who is said to have been the first woman to drive a car in Nigeria, she fought against the practice of female genital mutilation. Mutu explains why this diptych is both tantalizing and menacing: "The figure exists in an imaginary outer space, clutching a mangled serpent, the phallic and mythological creature that instigated the downfall of Eve. . . . The image and title are infested with the inherent contradictions that were the experience of a radical like Funmilayo. A visionary and brave fighter, she was caught in the upheaval of the creation of a nation's identity."
