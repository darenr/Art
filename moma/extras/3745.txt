The Light Light Chair, weighing a mere two pounds, is built with a Nomex honeycomb core and a carbon-fiber surface. The direction of the fiber is strategically placed to counteract the thrust transmitted by the weight of a sitter. Additional unidirectional fibers are applied to reinforce the high-stress joints.
