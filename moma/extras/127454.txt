Mac Low, known more as a poet, a composer of performance pieces, and a performer than as a composer of music, was a student in Cage’s Experimental Music Composition classes at the New School for Social Research and an important figure in the early avant–garde circles in New York, including Fluxus. The works in his Drawing–Asymmetry series employ chance operations. As performance scores, they invite free interpretation. His work was performed at the Living Theater, Ono’s Chambers Street loft, and Maciunas’s AG Gallery—all centers of radical art at the time.
