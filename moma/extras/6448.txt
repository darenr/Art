This poster promoted the 1968 psychedelic comedy film Head, written by Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson and directed by Rafelson. John Brockman, a young producer associated with Andy Warhol's Factory, created the trailer and advertising for the film using images of his own head, even though he does not appear in the film. Head's stars are the Monkees, the "prefab four," created for a mid-1960s American television series. The Monkees approached this project as a chance to disassociate themselves from the media machine that had created them. (They sing, "Hey, hey, we're the Monkees /You know we love to please / A manufactured image / With no philosophies.") The plotless film presents series of wacky vignettes filled with pop-culture parodies and musical numbers.
