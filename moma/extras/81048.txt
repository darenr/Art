This steel sculpture with satyrlike forms was named after LeRoy Borton, a blacksmith who had helped Smith power forge a series of sculptures the previous year. "Borton's interest in my work was more than that of the subcontracting of man and machine," Smith said. "He was an excellent craftsman developed in the old school of hard forging, tempering of chisels, wagon repair, etc. In the days we worked together we became friendly, talking of metal working methods, etc. . . .History of LeRoy Borton is an homage to a friend."
