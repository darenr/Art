Starting in the mid-1960s Wroclaw became a center for Poland's theatrical and artistic avant-garde. Teatr STU was one of the most significant experimental theater groups in the country, and legendary figures Tadeusz Kantor and Andrzej Wajda honed their directing skills there. For STU's production of Exodus, Sawka, a young art student, created this metaphorical image of an isolated figure as a burnt match. Several years later he moved to New York, where his practice developed to include set designs on budgets from one hundred to nearly four million dollars, for musicians such as the Grateful Dead and Steve Winwood.
