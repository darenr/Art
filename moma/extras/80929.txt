Winsor's use of a cube can be seen in relation to Minimalist sculpture of the 1960s; however, she undermined this basic form by setting the cement, wood, and wire mesh structure over a bonfire. She burned the cube for about five hours, until, she has said, it "began to expand and round slightly. As it cooled later, it contracted and the cube became slightly concave. During the firing, fragments of concrete popped off the main body to a distance of twenty feet. I had researched the material's properties because I wanted to push it to its structural limit, to where the concrete was actively, dangerously, responding to the heat but was not overwhelmed or destroyed. . . . That is what physically happened to the form and material. That is its history."
