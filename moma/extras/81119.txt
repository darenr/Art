Baboon and Young shows Picasso's power of metaphorical transformation at its height. In the original assemblage from which this bronze baboon was cast, her face was formed from two toy cars—one upright, the other turned upside down—that Picasso had borrowed from his son Claude, and her tail was an automobile spring. The baboon's ears were made from cup handles, and her round belly was a large jug whose handles form the shape of her shoulders.
