Warhol created this set of four mimeograph stencils in response to a request from the Pasadena Art Museum for works that could be reproduced and sold in conjunction with a 1962 group exhibition. He drew directly on the blue paper with a stylus that made perforations through which ink could be forced to produce copies. His images represent several of his key subjects at the time, including a Campbell's soup can. The mimeograph, which was replaced by the photocopy later in the 1960s, was a low-cost means of making copies. This is the only known occasion when Warhol used it to make artworks. It seems these sheets were never actually used to make copies.
