In 1947 Earl Tupper, an inventor and chemist at DuPont, designed the unique air- and watertight Tupper Seal for food containers that prevented both spilling and spoilage. He then applied this enhancement to his polyethylene range of Welcome Ware, which he had developed years earlier. The result—Tupperware—became a powerful symbol of suburban domestic life in the 1950s. In addition to its cutting-edge material and form, Tupperware’s innovative marketing secured its success. Brownie Wise, a single mother who ultimately became vice president of the company, devised the hostess-party model, in which housewives could sell Tupperware to earn money independently.
