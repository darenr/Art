Grotjahn, a Los Angelesâ€“based artist, draws on Renaissance perspectival techniques for the structures and subjects of his multiple-vanishing-point butterfly pattern drawings. His forms stretch and shrink and approach and recede, playing with the logic of linear perspective. Grotjahn is inspired by the hand-painted signs found in "mom and pop" stores, with their off-kilter graphics and makeshift lettering, and he uses this homemade aesthetic to subvert the hard-edge precision traditionally associated with geometric abstraction.
