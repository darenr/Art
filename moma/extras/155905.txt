Creating painterly fields of color in this unusually large aquatint, Johns has built a composition in multiple sections, each populated by elements the artist frequently employs in his work: a child's silhouette, the vase/faces optical illusion, a ladder, rotating discs, and spots of color. In addition, a yellow cloth is nailed to the ladder's upper rungâ€”perhaps related to the handkerchief in The Weeping Woman, I (1937), by Pablo Picasso, whose work has been an ever-present influence on Johns. Printmaking is an integral part of Johns's practice, in large part due to his collaboration, since 1960, with Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE), a pioneering workshop established on Long Island in 1957. The Museum collects an impression from each edition published by ULAE, documenting the ongoing activities of the seminal workshop through this archive.
