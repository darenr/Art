Many of the foundations of The New Typography were derived from the social and artistic experimentation of Constructivist designers in the Soviet Union. The Cyrillic alphabet lent itself to simplification and abstraction, and in these designs for LEF—one of the most famous and widely distributed of the Soviet avant-garde magazines—Rodchenko combined elemental typography with strong color and emblematic photographs or photomontage. Tschichold's extensive collection of Soviet Russian materials such as these magazines made him suspect to Nazi authorities in Munich and led to his arrest in 1933.
