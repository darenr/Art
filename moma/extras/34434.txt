Villeglé found his materials in his aimless strolls through the city of Paris, in peeling accretions of fliers, advertisements, and graffiti. Often friezes of scattered layers of torn and shredded paper, the artist’sdécollages (from the French word décoller, to unglue or take off) are collaborations after the fact with the city dwellers who subjected the material to anonymous defacement.
