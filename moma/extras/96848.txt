Oehlen uses abstract compositions to investigate his position within the sociopolitical context of Germany; he has played in various punk bands, and references to music are frequent in his paintings and drawings. In this series the artist uses a strict set of three colors in abstract compositions reminiscent of the early–twentieth century drawings of Russian artist Vasily Kandinsky. As such, Oehlen simultaneously mocks art–historical convention and belies the description Neo–Expressionist, which was used to describe his generation of artists and their subjective and carefree painting style.
