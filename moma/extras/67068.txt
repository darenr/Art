This is one of several etchings Klee made that refer to ancient Greek comedies; in this example, both mask and face are significantly deformed. The artist said, "This is my most personal work up to now...Its expression flowed from my deepest soul." Klee described the subject of this print as "a grotesque mask on a grave and moral head...The mask represents art, behind it hides man." He considered the print's etched lines to be "roads to the analysis of the work of art."
