Kruger's art often pairs appropriated black–and–white photographs with red bands of text carrying punchy, loaded phrases, such as "I shop therefore I am" or "Your body is a battleground." These provocative combinations of texts and images subvert commodity culture while simultaneously reveling in its attractive packaging.Here Kruger has illustrated "My Pretty Pony," a short story by novelist Stephen King. King's story is about the perception and experience of time: After witnessing his young grandson fall prey to an unfairly timed game of hide–and–seek, an elderly man educates the boy on the difference between perceived, actual, and manipulated time, using the words "my pretty pony" as a counting aid. The brushed stainless steel book cover is emblazoned not with a title or an image but with a working digital clock that tracks the reader's own time. Within the pages, Kruger overlaid images of horses and riders with a small photograph of a hand holding a stopwatch, punctuated by one or two words, which together spell out, "Time ain't got nothing to do with how fast you can count."
