Trockel created what she calls her "knitting pictures" as a response to her perception of a male-dominated art world. By using traditionally feminine resources and techniques, she calls into question an assumed hierarchy of materials, which places painting at the top and craft at the bottom. In this work, knitted wool was stretched on a frame, mimicking the typical way an oil painting on canvas is displayed. A commercial machine was programmed to knit the phrase "Made in Western Germany" into the wool, an allusion to the artist's background and to the commodification of artists and art in a capitalist society.
