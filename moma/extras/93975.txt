The bicycle manufacturer Biomega, the clothing company Vexed Generation, and the sports-equipment manufacturer Puma joined forces to launch a limited-edition series consisting of this bike and a range of accessories and garments designed for everyday use in the city. A folding mechanism allows the bike to be reduced in size by fifty percent to fit in tight spaces. Its main feature is a lock that is integrated within the structural framework. If a would-be thief breaks the lock, the bicycle breaks as well.
