Dittborn, a painter, printmaker, and video artist, is perhaps best known for his Airmail series, to which this screenprint belongs. In 8 Survivors, the artist has used an eclectic mix of sources, including newspaper articles, police photographs, children's drawings, and excerpts from ethnographic textbooks. Like the other works in the series, the large sheet of paper is folded, sent by mail, and finally exhibited unfolded and pinned to the wall alongside its envelope. Dittborn began his Airmail series in 1983, when Chile was under military dictatorship, and, initially at least, it was a means of addressing and transcending problems of isolation and censorship. The faces in these works have also been interpreted as reminders of the thousands of political prisoners who "disappeared" during this time. The artist has likened the envelopes to a protective skin or womb, and the process of uncovering the artwork is akin to unfolding a lost or forgotten story.
