These images, based largely on Dix's grisly memories, are an unflinching account of the horror and perversity of war. Many picture the aftermath of battle: dying, dead, or decomposing bodies, shell-shocked soldiers, and bombed-out landscapes. The artist exploited the corrosive nature of etching and aquatint—mediums in which acid etches a metal printing plate—to heighten the sense of decay. Dix had served as a machine gunner from 1914 to 1918 and saw combat on both the Eastern and Western fronts.
