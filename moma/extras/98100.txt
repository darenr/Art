In the midst of a storm at sea, attempting to board a life raft is extremely difficult. This raft, which is fitted with handles on either side and a step that extends below the surface of the water, enables the person at sea to grab the handles and raise her legs from the water without putting strain on her arms, which are used only for stability. The wide step allows the occupants of the life raft to lean out to help other people enter. The raft positions itself according to the direction of the wind and can be oriented by its occupants so that its opening faces the people swimming toward it.
