Kupka was born in the Czech Republic and settled in Paris in 1896. In 1910 he became one of the first artists to work in a completely abstract mode, developing colorful, visionary paintings and watercolors such as these. They are a product of his mystical belief that rhythmic forms in pure colors can reflect the forces of the cosmos.
