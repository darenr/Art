Rothâ€™s project Book comprises more than thirty separate works, made in 1958, 1959, and 1964. Each work, including Book AC, consists of loose pages in two colors, which can be shuffled and oriented in any way the reader chooses. Each page of the book features a series of cut slots: thick and thin, single and multiple, at various angles. Turning the page is a distinctly kinetic experience as one cut sheet piles on top of another, with the patterned grids flickering to great optical effect.
