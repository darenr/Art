A series in which Dean painted out the backgrounds of old postcards depicting trees led her to her own photographs of famous or ancient trees in her native England.  Here we see the "Crowhurst yew," located on the grounds of a twelfth–century church and said to be over four thousand years old. It shares its name with one of Dean's favorite subjects, the English sailor Donald Crowhurst, who disappeared in the late 1960s during a solo round–the–world boat race.
