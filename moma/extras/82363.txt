Nozkowski has made this comment about his approach to abstraction: "My work is 'abstracted' from reality, I suppose, in that each painting has an exact and specific source in the physical world. One of the reasons I do this is to find extraordinary formal devices—colors, shapes, compositions—which I would not have discovered with a strictly formal way of painting."
