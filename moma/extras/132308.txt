Autopole is a lightweight telescopic expansion tube with a cantilever locking system and protective rubber ends that can be securely placed between walls or between the ceiling and the floor. It can stand alone and function as a lighting stand or be used with other poles to support backdrops for photography or filming. Because of its versatility, it has become standard studio equipment in those industries.
