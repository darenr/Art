The succinct and dynamic composition of Trepkowski's poster captured the memory of the devastation wrought in World War IIâ€”just one in four buildings remained standing in Warsaw. The threat of further international conflict generated much  propaganda in the 1950s promoting the cause of peace. The Communist central state focused its attention on the rebuilding of the capital as a symbolic center of a new utopian order menaced by "capitalist aggression." Trepkowski died at age forty, acknowledged as one of the most influential poster designers in Poland.
