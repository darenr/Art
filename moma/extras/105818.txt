Experiences of time and space are central to Tuttle's work. He metaphorically marks the passage of time in this suite of seven prints, titling them after the days of the week, and accompanies the set with a short treatise about time and its origins. Tuttle places his imagery on each sheet in inventive ways, paralleling his sensitive installations of sculpture.
