Aycock's monumental sculpture was built for her 1977 Projects exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art. The artist identifies many architectural sources for the work, including "medieval walled towns, Roman amphitheaters, military bunkers, Egyptian shanty towns and desert citadels, and an eighteenth-century Indian observatory at Jaipur." The viewer is intentionally barred from having full access to the workâ€”parts cannot be seen at all; others may be viewed partially from the corridor in the center of the structure. Through this project Aycock seeks to heighten viewers' psychological reaction to architecture and their awareness of the spaces they regularly occupy.
