Around the same time that Tupperware was gaining popularity in the United States, the Milan-based plastics manufacturer Kartell was establishing itself as a European leader in this increasingly important modern material. Colombini, who headed Kartell's technical department from its founding in 1949, was awarded Compasso dâ€™Oro prizes (Italy's top honor for good design) in 1955, 1957, 1959, and 1960. His household objects, including these for the kitchen, took advantage of the aesthetic possibilities of plastic, in addition to being both economical and durable.
