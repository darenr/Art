In the late 1960s, Toroni, and others of his generation working in Paris, reacted against the highly emotional and gestural style of painting that had preceded them. Toroni devised a conceptual approach and calls his systematic markings "imprints." He consistently uses a standard No. 50 paintbrush to determine the size of the strokes that he applies to canvas, paper, and walls, at intervals of 11.8 inches (30 centimeters). "It's the working method that defines what is seen," he has said.
