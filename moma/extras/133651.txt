Mesh Chair, the designer has explained, is manufactured like a piece of clothing: “Its pattern parts are cut out of a sheet of expanded metal mesh. The pieces are welded together along the seams resulting in a shape that becomes rigid because of its three-dimensionality. The powder coating softens the metal mesh. In this way upholstery and construction have become one.”
