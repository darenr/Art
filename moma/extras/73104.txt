Nitsch was one of the Actionist artists of Vienna, a loose 1960s group that staged transgressive performances in defiance of social mores. His goal in the series of events he titled Orgien Mysterien [O.M.] Theatre (Orgies-mysteries theatre) was an overwhelming drama of the senses, a gory bacchanalia. This sheet, for example, was covered with pig's blood before being printed with a rendering of the imagined theater.
