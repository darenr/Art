The Mollycoddle, Douglas Fairbanks's third film for United Artists (which he cofounded in 1919 with Mary Pickford, Charles Chaplin, and D. W. Griffith) is also one of Fairbanks's last films with a contemporary setting, before he turned full-time to the production of costume subjects during the 1920s. In the film, he plays a fifth-generation American who lives in Europe and is so far removed from the land of his forefathers that he has become comically emasculated. On a lark, he is shanghaied by a trio of young Americans onto a yacht headed for the U.S., only to discover that the captain is a jewel smuggler on his way to the American Southwest. The silly plot serves merely as a hook on which to hang some of Fairbanks's most inventive visual gags as well as a means of incorporating dramatic footage from the Navajo County Hopi Indian Reservation. Logical narratives were never Fairbanks's strong suit, and in The Mollycoddle he demonstrated once again that his breathtaking physical prowess and undaunted optimism could overcome any obstacles.
