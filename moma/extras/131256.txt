For this project Meindertsma tracked all the products made from a single pig over the course of a three-year study and then published the results in this book, designed with Joliat. Parts of the pig numbered 05049, selected at random from a commercial farm in the Netherlands, were used in 185 different products, and each one is pictured. These include the expected foodstuffs as well as nonfood items such as photographic film, toothpaste, and even the glue used in the bookâ€™s binding. This visual catalogue of one animal's afterlife explores the complexity of the meat-processing industry and the many of points of contact we have with animal products that we may not be aware of.
