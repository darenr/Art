Part of a series of architectural paintings O'Keeffe made in the late 1920s, Farmhouse Window and Door shows a detail of the upstate New York farmhouse where she regularly summered with her husband, Alfred Stieglitz. The symmetrical window with black shutters is surrounded by a narrow frame of clapboard siding. The floating grayâ€“green rectangle is likely a door inside the home. With its subdued palette and simplified forms, the painting alludes to reflection and transparency. Of this technique O'Keeffe stated, "I found that I could say things with color and shapes that I couldn't say in any other way."
