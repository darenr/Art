Thrown into stark relief against a pitch-black ground, this truncated, leggy figure succinctly captures the leading character of Poor Cowâ€”an eighteen-year-old runaway whose life deteriorates into objectification as a faceless prostitute. Her psychedelic minidress references the film's pop soundtrack and signals the widespread awareness in Poland of Western youth culture in the 1960s.
