Contemporary Dutch designers have been markedly innovative in experimenting with materials, a trend that crosses international boundaries. Readily available at any hardware store, Graumans's simple materials—eighty-five black cords, sockets, and light bulbs—yield a grand chandelier through the strength of his design. Gathered in a unified bundle at the ceiling, the cords flare out to accommodate the mass of lightbulbs below.Graumans's 85 Lamps was selected for inclusion in the first design collection offered by Droog Design, established in 1994 by designers and theorists Gijs Bakker and Renny Ramakers. It is a firm that has captured much attention for its stance against consumerism and its use of industrial and recycled materials. The diverse works of the talented young designers chosen for The Museum of Modern Art design collection celebrate ingenuity, economy of form, and a minimalist aesthetic, as does this lamp by Graumans.
