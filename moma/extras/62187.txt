Buren is known for his site–specific installations of colored stripes, which he creates with the goal of altering the viewer’s perception of the surrounding architecture. His idea for this work was to have a forty–by–forty–foot striped aquatint "explode" into twenty–five fragments. To this end he cut the print into twenty-five equal squares and has stipulated that the fragments "expand" to fit whatever wall is chosen for them. The work is different each time it is installed on a different–sized wall.
