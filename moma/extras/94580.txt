Headscarf was on view in the exhibition Head Guard, organized by Ezri Tarazi at the Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem in 2003, which gathered ideas from designers, artists, and students for everyday head protection. Reminiscent of a hijab, Rosenfeld's Headscarf, made of stainless steel knitted ball chain and secured with knitting needles, provides protection to a Muslim woman without annulling her identity.
