Over the past three decades, Muñoz has been producing works that investigate the nature of representation and the relationship between image and memory. In the twelve–part work The Game of Probabilities, which examines self–portraiture, the artist has woven fragments from six of his own identity photographs into twelve different configurations, then rephotographed them. The black–and–white and color identity photographs, which were made over a number of years for official documents such as passports and driver’s licenses, highlight the physical transformation of the artist, suggesting identity’s infinite mutations and the limitations of photography in representing human likeness.
