In 1935 Wagenfeld was appointed art director of a large glassware manufacturer, Lausitzer Glasverein. The unadorned geometric forms of his popular Kubus containers represented the kind of mass-produced objects that the Bauhaus had aspired to produce. Stackable, modular, space-saving, and hygienic, they could be transferred directly from refrigerator or cupboard to the dining table, and encouraged the thrifty use of leftovers.
