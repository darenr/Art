Completely made of carbon fiber, the Carbon Chair is a high-tech update of the well-known molded fiberglass chair designed by Charles and Ray Eames in 1950. It was intended to be an exact replica of the Eames design, complete with the so-called Eiffel Tower base. The base proved unstable, however, so Wanders and Pot redesigned the chair with the more stable leg configuration seen in this example.
