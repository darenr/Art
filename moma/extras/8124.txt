The photograph by Hungarian-born artist and designer László Moholy-Nagy (1895–1946) featured in this advertisement for a periodical devoted to his work demonstrates his interest in the play of projected light over three-dimensional surfaces, and its influence may be seen in the corporeal focus of Brownjohn's title sequence for Goldfinger. Before moving to Chicago in 1936, Moholy-Nagy famously pursued this fascination at the Bauhaus school of art and design in Germany, through an experimental fusion of type, film, and photography that revolutionized the practice of graphic design in Europe and the United States.
