In 1947 Tupper, an inventor and chemist at DuPont, designed the unique air- and watertight Tupper Seal for containers to prevent both spilling and food spoilage. He used this feature to enhance his range of polyethylene Welcome Ware, devised years earlier. The result—Tupperware—became a powerful symbol of suburban domestic life in the 1950s. In addition to its cutting-edge material and form, Tupperware's innovative marketing secured its success. Brownie Wise, a single mother who ultimately became vice president of the company, developed the hostess party model that gave housewives the chance to earn money independently.
