In his early twenties Christo escaped the oppressive Communist regime in his native country and wandered in exile throughout Europe, supporting himself primarily by painting commissioned portraits. He has related his early wrapped-package works to the isolation and sadness of his coming of age in Bulgaria; the wheelbarrow, in particular, suggests a stateless, nomadic life. In 1964, shortly after making Package on Wheelbarrow, Christo relocated to New York City. There, in partnership with his wife, Jeanne-Claude, he has created large-scale temporary installations, wrapping trees, islands, buildings, and bridges in fabric.
