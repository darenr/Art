Caldas's work, whether in drawing or in sculpture, seeks to confuse viewers' conception of space. His work Mirror of Light (1974), reflects the gallery and the other artworks on view, including the people looking at them.  Japan, a triptych of drawings seems to relate to the geographical system, but its scattered points and numbers are random arrangments.  They are "hypothetical loactions of something we never reach," Caldas has said.
