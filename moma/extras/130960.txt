This program documents the mix of avant-garde music, theater and poetry on offer at this fashionable nightspot. The venue, opened in 1907, operated under the auspices of the Wiener Werkst√§tte, a cooperative of avant-garde architects, artists, and designers. The combined role of music and design in this venture exemplified the idea of the Gesamtkunstwerk or total work of art in that the same aesthetic principles were applied to the programming and venue as to the design of the program.
