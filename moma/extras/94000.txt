The Camcopter S-100, a compact and lightweight helicopter with an autonomous flight-control system, was originally designed for aerial mine detection by the Vienna-based company Schiebel, specializing in humanitarian de-mining since the 1970s. In addition to its original use, the vehicle, here in its second generation, has proved its efficiency in a number of other applications: border and harbor patrol; anti-smuggling actions; tactical surveillance, including maritime reconnaissance; firefighting in forests; monitoring of natural disasters; flood relief; search and rescue of missing persons in out-of-the-way areas; surveillance of oil pipelines, railways, industrial plants, and water, power, and communication lines; precise dropping of humanitarian aid in inaccessible areas; cartographic studies and surveys; scientific measurements; and pest control in agriculture.
