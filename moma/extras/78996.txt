The color of Grove Group, I was inspired by a stand of olive trees Marden saw in Greece. Working in a sensuous mix of oil paint and wax, he created an opaque and dense surface of substance and mass. At the same time, the painting seems weightless and luminescentâ€”as if in building up the surface Marden trapped light within its layers. This painting is part of a series of five monochrome panels in related colors. While the modular, methodical design recalls strategies of Minimalism, Marden considers this painting to be "highly emotional."
