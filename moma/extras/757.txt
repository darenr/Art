In 1943 the journal Architectural Forum commissioned a series of projects depicting the ideal postwar American small city. In this museum interior, photographs of foliage and water in a linear band suggest the perimeter of an otherwise limitless architectural space. Floating in the space are three artworks: Pablo Picasso’s painting Guernica (1937) framed by Aristide Maillol’s sculptures Monument to Paul Cézanne (1912–25, left) and Night (1909, right). The artworks are architectural elements, creating the spatial divisions that organize the vast space of the museum. In the almost aggressive frontality of the scene, the space of the museum is evoked entirely through the vertical orientation of these flat pictorial elements on the page. Guernica’s disquieting narrative stages its own disruption toward the center of the frame.
