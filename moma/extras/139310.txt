Miller was inspired by the style of the typefaces designed in Scotland during the first decades of the nineteenth century. In the United States they became known as Scotch Roman typefaces and were used widely in the nineteenth century for newspapers. Thanks to their vertical stress and roundness and their tall x-heights, the letters show up very well at small sizes and on ink-thirsty, low-quality newsprint. A special adaptation of Miller was created for the Guardian newspaper in London, and it has been used in newspapers including the Hindustan Times and the Boston Globe.
