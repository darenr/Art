This set of kitchen utensils belongs to the clean-lined, stainless steel "mono" series for which Raacke is best known. The series began in the late 1950s with mono-a (for alpha), which was followed by numerous iterations into the early 1980s, including mono petit for children. Raacke, who trained in gold- and silversmithing, also designed cardboard furniture and a diesel locomotive. He cofounded the Association of German Industrial Designers (VDID) in 1959 and taught for more than thirty years at major German universities. Along with Max Bill, he is associated with the reemergence of "good design" in Europe after World War II.
