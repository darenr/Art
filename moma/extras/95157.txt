Victor capitalizes on the narrative possibilities of intaglio in her searing series Disasters of Peace, an ongoing project inspired by Francisco de Goya's historic cycle of etchings Disasters of War (1810–20). To date, there are more than thirty prints in Victor's series. Its surreal, nightmarish compositions are based on media coverage of recent events in South Africa, calling attention to the everyday disasters that are apartheid’s legacy.
