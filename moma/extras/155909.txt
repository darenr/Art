Outliers began as a small etching. Working with the printers at Universal Limited Art Editions, Yuskavage enlarged the original composition digitally and then printed it in inkjet and an overlay of offset lithography, enhancing the lavish hues of the work's middle ground and background. She then added to the print by hand, using pastel. A hybrid print/drawing, Outliers is an unusual bridge between Yuskavage's typically distinct work in printmaking, drawing, and painting, and it is an example of print workshops’ integration of new technologies with older and traditional techniques. Influenced by clichés, cartoons, pornography, Mannerist style, and traditional voyeuristic treatments of the nude female form, Yuskavage's work, along with that of other artists who emerged in the 1990s, has revitalized the genre of figurative painting.
