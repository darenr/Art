An amateur jazz musician and fan, Troxler has organized the annual Willisau Jazz Festival since 1975. "Everything that fascinates me about jazz music is also what interests me in design: rhythm, sound, contrast, interaction, experiment, improvisation, composition, individuality. I have been organizing jazz concerts for as long as I have been designing," he has said. In Troxlerâ€™s posters, color, line, and letterforms re-create the restlessness of jazz music, its movement and invention. He begins each work by searching for metaphors for the music and then translates them into illustrations or typography.
