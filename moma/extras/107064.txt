In collaboration with a specialized printmaking workshop, Kentridge created this monumental linoleum cut using a large panel of linoleum flooring. Because it is inexpensive and easy to print, linoleum is used widely in community-based printmaking workshops in South Africa. Expressive black-and-white patterning is characteristic of the medium.
