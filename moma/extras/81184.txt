Simonds began making his miniature Dwellings early in the 1970s, situating them in outdoor spaces in the downtown Manhattan neighborhoods of the Lower East Side and SoHo. Passersby found them on windowsills, on the brick facades of abandoned buildings, and in empty lots.  The artist imagined these to be homes for a nomadic population he called "the Little People."  He describes his Dwellings that reside indoors, such as this work, as "mixed metaphors of landscape, body, house, and growth."
