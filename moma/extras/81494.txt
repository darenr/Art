Remainders: Novel, Sculpture, Film looks like a remainder table at a chain bookstore. However, the sixteen titles on display—each multiplied to create an impression of stacks of identical books—were never published. The interior images reproduce film frames culled from Ruppersberg's extensive collection of American educational and instructional films from the 1930s to the 1960s. Each volume repeats a different image over and over again to simulate the multiple frames of a film; this is Ruppersberg's attempt to create a cinematic experience in book form. The artist has described this work as a multiple within a multiple, one in which the text can be watched, the film read, and the contents combined to create a novel.
