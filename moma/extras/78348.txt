When Picabia painted this work, in Paris in 1914, he had recently returned from a triumphal trip to New York. There he had exhibited at the famous Armory Show of 1913, whose mix of American and European modern art had attracted large crowds, and concurrently in a one-man show at Alfred Stieglitz’s avant-garde 291 gallery. Aboard the steamship that had taken him to New York, Picabia had been captivated by the movement of Stacia Napierkowska, a Polish dancer en route to a tour of American music halls. (Her performances were suggestive enough to provoke her arrest once on U.S. shores.) Over the next two years, Picabia produced several monumental canvases that he said were inspired by his memories of Napierkowska, and also, he said, "of America, evocations from there which, subtly opposed like musical harmonies, become representative of an idea, of a nostalgia, of a fugitive impression." In Je revois en souvenir ma chère Udnie, rather than representing the dancer herself, Picabia creates a visual analogy for the lingering sensation of this sensuous encounter: segmented tubes and curling organic forms fill the vertical axis of the canvas in a slow upward spiral.
