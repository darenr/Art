In a colorful, wall-sized grid of nine frames, a cartoon-style narrative unfolds. In the first frame, a central square (or "cell," in Halley's terminology) suggests a building in an empty landscape. Windowless and doorless, it has no apparent entrance or exit save for two "conduits": an underground pipeline below and a smokestack above. In the subsequent frames, read left to right like a comic strip, this cell is transformed into states of contamination, explosion, meltdown, and, finally, nothingness. For the installation Halley covered the walls behind the nine framed works with a simplified, black-and-white, endlessly repeatable version of these color screenprints. Conceived as a digital project, this wallpaper expands the boundaries of traditional printmaking; each time it is installed, a silkscreen printer must generate new sheets using digital files owned by MoMA.Influenced by theories about the hidden systems and ideologies that govern activity in postindustrial society, Halley continually re-creates his cells and conduits in ongoing series of painted and printed variations. In his printmaking he allows himself more freedom to play with their narrative possibilities, demonstrating that they are not simply abstract compositions but symbolic, diagrammatic representations of architectural and social bodies.
