Bavington interprets rock-and-roll guitar solos by translating the sounds, beats, and rhythms of individual tracks into paint. Having elaborated his own twelve-hue color chart, he assigns a particular color to each note, and the width of each painted band corresponds to the noteâ€™s length. Black is used for pauses; it echoes the color of audio speakers and the look of obsolete "boom boxes." In this work the artist has rendered in visual terms a guitar solo from the song "Physical S.E.X.," by the contemporary British band Darkness. "Each part of the composition is presented in a specific order with a  specific duration to a passive listener," Bavington notes of his painting. He invites viewers to "begin at different points, to scan and meander across the canvas, creating our own chronology."
