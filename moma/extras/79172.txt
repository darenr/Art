This is one of a series of works on unstretched fabric that Rauschenberg called "Hoarfrosts." "I read the word in Dante," he explained. "Hoarfrost is like a mock frost, but its a warning about the change of seasons." Semitransparent diaphanous fabric imprinted with magazine images hangs like veils' covering a collage of similar images drawn from popular culture. In sharp contrast to the overwrought surface of Bed, Rauschenberg stated that here he was "actually trying to dematerialize the surface as much as I could so that you had a sense of the fabric being there so light would have something to fall on."
