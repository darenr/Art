The scene is the bathroom of Bonnard’s own home and the woman naked at her toilette is the artist’s wife, Marthe, accompanied in the foreground by their dog, Pouce. Although Marthe appears in many of Bonnard’s paintings, seldom is her face fully visible, creating a sense of casual intimacy. Bonnard painted his unstretched canvases from memory, assisted only by small sketches. His technique and his use of color—applied in seemingly spontaneous, discrete strokes—are indebted to Impressionism, but the flatness of the image and the high-pitched hues of color in this work were in deep accord with the latest modernist practices.
