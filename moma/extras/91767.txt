In 1960 Clark began to produce movable metal sculptures that could be modified by the spectator from threeâ€“dimensional planes to flat reliefs. Poetic Shelter is an attempt to overcome the separation between physical shelter and poetry, life and art,by inviting spectators to interact with the object, creating new constructions and casting aside traditional conceptions of the home. In this work, as in her drawings in this exhibition, Clark liberates the plane or line from its inanimate condition and recovers its vitality through movement and transformation in space.
