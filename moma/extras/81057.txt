The first major installation produced by Soviet artist Ilya Kabakov after he immigrated to the West in 1987 was entitled Ten Characters. The work included ten rooms devoted to fictional narratives of characters living in isolation, and relate to the artist's alienation from his unfamiliar cultural surroundings. Behind this door is one of the rooms. Evocative of an abandoned communal Soviet apartment, the dimly lit room includes a chair facing a large white board. The accompanying text tells of the absent protagonist's transcendental experience. To escape his melancholy surroundings, he perceives the miniature, faintly rendered man on the white board as himself flying into an infinite depth of blinding white light and fog. Ultimately, this is tempered by the character's doubt about his perceptions, and he longs for the presence of a third person to validate them.
