After World War II, the rhetoric of efficiency remained a powerful force behind the design and promotion of modern kitchens. This film demonstrates a U-shaped kitchen that was developed by the Bureau of Human Nutrition and Home Economics. This model space was organized around "work centers" for key activities and the finding that "most women prefer to work right to left." Many of its features, such as the integrated counter "garbage hatch," the large picture window for natural light, the pull-out surface for tasks that require seating, and labeled storage bins for seasonings and dry goods, were actually developed many years before and featured in Grete Sch√ºtte-Lihotzky's Frankfurt Kitchen.
