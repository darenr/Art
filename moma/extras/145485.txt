littleBits is a hardware library of preassembled circuit boards that connect to one another with magnets, allowing nonexperts to assemble circuit prototypes by snapping together electronic components in an intuitive process. There are over fifty littleBits modules, divided into four categories: power, input, output, and wire. The starter kit contains ten of them, including a pressure sensor, a vibration motor, a wire, and a wall power module.
