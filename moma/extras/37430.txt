Dal√≠ had recently joined the Surrealist movement when he executed this drawing, which served as the frontispiece for the "Second Surrealist Manifesto" when it was published in a limited edition of sixty copies in 1930. The composition's upper-right quadrant is dominated by an anthropomorphic chain of flesh, in which a human head turns into a lion, which becomes a misshapen,ant-infested profile. The succession continues with a bird's head, a mustachioed female bust, anothe male profile, and two more frontal faces, one animal and one human. These fantastic characters stretch out in a string of anatomy that might have continued endlessly were it not for the edge of the sheet.
