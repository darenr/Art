Picasso was a great animal lover and he surrounded himself with pets such as dogs, goats, and birds (including an owl he tamed to sit on his finger). This rapport translated in his art to distinctive renderings of an animal's features and movements. While some animals served as fearsome symbols for him, most were free of such associations and depicted with charm and apparent pleasure.
