Hicks's weavings often make reference to surfaces, landscapes, and built environments. The parabolic shape delineated by Prayer Rugâ€™s  tassels mimics arch forms common to the Islamic architecture Hicks encountered in North Africa during extensive travel throughout the world. The vertical display of the piece upends the notion of the rug as a textile trodden underfoot, while bound tassels projecting from the plane emphasize the tactile quality of the wool fibers. During the 1960s and 1970s, Hicks made many soft fiber pieces for modernist corporate offices and public spaces that offered a foil to the severity of their interiors.
