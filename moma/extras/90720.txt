The Vellum Curve works, which this is a part of, involve folding sheets of a material—here, vellum—according to the principles of the Golden Section. In these works, though, Rockburne first drew one circle and one ellipse—each in a distinct color—on each vellum sheet, determining their position in relation to the Golden Rectangle (a rectangle whose proportions follow the logic of the Golden Section). Rockburne first used vellum in the 1973 wall work Neighbourhood. She increasingly favored the material for its ability to “facilitate its transparency.”
