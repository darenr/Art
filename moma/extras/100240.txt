This untitled work by Robert Grosvenor, one of only nine sculptures that the artist made between 1977 and 1991, was fabricated from steel and chain-link fence and spraypainted with auto-body paint. These industrial materials point to the artistâ€™s roots in Minimalism, and, indeed, Grosvenor practiced and exhibited as a mainstream Minimalist in the 1960s. Using the lush vocabulary typical of his later sculptures, here Grosvenor manipulated the orderly gridlock pattern of the fence into a densely overlapped fringe.
