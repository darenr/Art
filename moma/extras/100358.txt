The hollow eye sockets in Daisy Youngblood's Elephant with Tusks suggest that the animal’s body is a vessel that might be occupied by some other presence. The close spiritual connection between animal and human worlds is crucial to her work. Her naturalistic color palette communicates, as she has written, a "strong feeling of connectedness to the world of ancient art." Although Youngblood attributes masculine characteristics to some animals, such as horses and goats, elephant heads are, for her, distinctly feminine: "I saw the image of a woman's body—ears as hands on hips, eyes as breasts—in the head of an African elephant."
