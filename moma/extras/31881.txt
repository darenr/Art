In this portfolio, working with the artist Henri-Gabriel Ibels and the writer Georges Montorgueil, Lautrec created an ode to the café-concert. Montorgueil’s essay argued that the café-concert was not a den of iniquity, but rather a tonic for modern life and a place for people from all walks of life to relax and commune. Lautrec’s images capture a cross-section of people involved in Paris nightlife, from dancers and singers to spectators, staff, and nightclub impresarios including Aristide Bruant.
