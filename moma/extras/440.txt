Collaborators since 1979, Diller and Scofidio have made the relationship between architecture and technology a pervasive theme in their work. The collage drawing TV in Picture Window Apparatus shows them manipulating a view of the ocean through the frame of a picture window and the technology of a video camera and monitor. Rather than the view itself, the representation of the view becomes their primary interest; indeed the monitor obstructs the actual view, while the camera transmits a copy of the view to the screen. Thus the drawing represents three different types of view, real, framed, and virtual, using a different medium for each one: a cutout magazine reproduction is pasted onto a pencil drawing of a plan and partial interior elevation of the picture window. Color photocopies of exterior perspectives, located beneath a Mylar sheet that covers the entire drawing, tie the parts of the image together. The right side of the drawing, a study of the mechanisms of the monitor's support arm, illustrates how the inhabitant can control the location of the television image.
