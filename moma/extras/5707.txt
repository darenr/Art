With a few deft strokes and patches of color, Steinlen conjures up an almost life-size image of the singer Guilbert in her trademark simple gown and black gloves as she prepares to go on stage. During her act at les Ambassadeurs she would stand almost perfectly still, gesturing with her long arms as she half-sang and half-spoke the raunchy lyrics of popular songs, some of them her own. A savvy self-promoter she commissioned her own posters and was also a favored subject of the artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.
