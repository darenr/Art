In the 1970s, upon becoming active in the feminist movement, she began a sustained exploration of the place of women in history.  This scrollâ€“like work presents a kind of narrative, yet its structure acknowledges the fragmented nature of the historical record as her texts and imagery travel between epochs and continents, presenting a testimony that mutates across time and place.
