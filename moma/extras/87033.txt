A 1901 catalogue of furniture by the architect and designer Baillie Scott advised clients to throw out all the furniture left to them by the previous generation rather than "perpetuate the memory of the departed in preserving these gloomy and silent witnesses of their bad taste." In the spirit of the British Arts and Crafts movement, most of Baillie Scott's pieces, including this table, were made of unadorned oak, reflecting the inspiration of vernacular sources. His preference for brightly painted furniture is evident in the schemes he submitted to the "house for an art lover" competition that same year (on display on this platform). Although based in England, Baillie Scott had many admirers in continental Europe, and executed commissions for the Grand Duke of Hesse in Darmstadt, Germany, and for Queen Marie of Romania.
