The artist developed the geometric patterns in this series from his long–standing interest in the game of chess. Starting with an offhand drawing of circular forms, Orozco formulated a set of rules for their colors, which evolve and expand outward based on the L–shaped move a knight makes on a chessboard. The Samurai of the title is Orozco’s term for the knight chess piece. The animation represents hundreds of manipulations of the chess move and is the basis of the print series. Orozco selected 672 "frames" from that animation to be produced as digital prints. The installation of the prints provides an alternative way of experiencing the variations: all at once, rather than frame by frame.
