De Kooning used oil and enamel sign paint to make this black and white abstraction, which he created in the same year as he held his first solo exhibition. He began Painting by transferring segments of figurative drawings to the canvas, then applying layers of paint. He maintained that "even abstract shapes must have a likeness." Indeed, these black forms bounded by white seem to approximate letters or human forms that never yield full legibility. Within the confines of a black and white palette, de Kooning delivers a complex and rich handling of paint: it drips, bleeds, congeals into solid forms, or dissolves into diaphanous streaksâ€”all of which result in a densely packed painting composed with a great economy of means.
