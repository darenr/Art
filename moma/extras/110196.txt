Monsters materializing from shadows cast on walls may sound like something from a child’s imagination, but Worthington has made the playful concept a reality. Shadow Monsters is based on custom- designed vision- recognition software. With the support of a computer, camera, projector, and light box, the software elaborates on viewers’ shadow gestures with sound and animation. Open and close your hands like a mouth, and a wolf with razor-sharp teeth will surface and growl; tongues, eyes, and fins appear; birds squawk and dinosaurs speak.
