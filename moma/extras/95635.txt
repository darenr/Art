Bryce describes his careful rendering of images and texts appropriated from newspapers, magazines, advertisements, and other historic documents as "mimetic analysis." While displaying technical ability, his reduction of the images to graphic black–and–white forms parodies the supposed objectivity of mass media. Bryce believes that his "critical homage" to the twentieth–century intellectual Leon Trotsky "points to a history that has been silenced and destroyed"—a history he inserts into the present for reconsideration.
