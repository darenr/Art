Insicuro noncurante, a portfolio of eighty-two numbered sheets, is an overview of Boetti's artistic production from 1966 to 1975. The portfolio reproduces original sketches and postcards, maps, and letters in a surveylike compilation of many of his most significant works made during that time. Developed with printmaker Rinaldo Rossi, the portfolio is, among other things, a homage to the American artist Marcel Duchamp (1887â€“1968), who, like Boetti, spent considerable energy and effort handcrafting miniature models of much of his work.
