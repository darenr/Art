This cap pops onto any standard-size aluminum soda can for the safe disposal of up to 150 hypodermic needles; after it is snapped on, it cannot be removed. Hân developed the Yellowone Needle Cap after realizing that no accessible, inexpensive, and flexible solution existed in developing countries for discarding such hazardous medical waste, leading to millions of accidental HIV and hepatitis B and C infections and polluted landscapes. Hân uses universal graphics (a skull and crossbones, a spider, a needle and hand), cautionary words, and a bright color to clearly communicate the containers purpose and contents. She worked with Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) and Unicef to research and test the practical applicability of her design in the field. At the end of 2011, the production and distribution was taken over by Danish mosquito-net manufacturing company Bestnet.
