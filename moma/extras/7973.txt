Glaser was recruited to capture what Robert Smith, general manager of RKO’s new flagship station in New York, termed the "bright young spirit. . .WOR-FM will definitely not be a screaming station but will be modern with a distinctive sound . . . Our strength lies in the stereophonic sound." Glaser’s four-color poster presented a graphically stylized image of contemporary musicians, complete with electric guitars, mod costumes and "in" hairstyles. Before the station went on the air it was posted (and often removed by fans) on New York subway platforms, buses, and billboards in the tristate area. Ratings for the new station soared.
