In 1984 Sudo was one of the founders of NUNO Corporation, a textile company interested in integrating traditional aesthetics with modern technological innovations. The bold, unfettered beauty of her work has garnered worldwide recognition and exhibitions in the United States, India, and Israel. This extraordinary fractured textile is created by bonding polyester organdy and rayon cloth. Patterns are produced by printing with an acid that burns out parts of the rayon fiber without affecting the polyester.
