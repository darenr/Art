Blume's exacting drawing delicately renders the details and texture of flower petals and leaves. Though using only pencil, he manages to capture a wide enough range of tone to suggest the rich color of his subject matter. Blume loved flowers, and he and his wife, Ebie, would often prepare bouquets from their garden. In this picture he included the open pair of scissors, partly hidden by leaves, that he had undoubtedly used to cut the pansies.
