Chaissac began making art in 1937, experimenting with line and automatic drawing. His self–defined "modern rustic art" developed from blending his untrained style (a product of his working–class background) with theinfluences of Pablo Picasso and Surrealism. In his later years, Chaissac created imaginative compositions that combine ambiguous shapes and puzzlelike figures in works on paper, paintings, and sculptures. In this drawing, Chaissac's solid lines and suggestive outlines are filled in by minute and intricate patterns, giving the work a sense of diversity and movement.
