Barcelona native Susana Solano began as a painter, but turned to sculpture as her primary medium. For Solano, art serves to "convert sensation and memory into a presence, into artistic space." The artist likes to work with porous iron, which gives structure to a space without fully enclosing or hiding it, suiting her preference for physical and psychological spaces that are not definitively demarcated: "In my life I hardly differentiate the spaces used from the fleeting places, my own objects from those not mine, other peopleâ€™s thoughts from my own."
