In this work Camargo highlights an optical and kinetic aesthetic without denying the natural features of material roughness: the artist has inserted one of his signature reliefs into the massive, elemental presence of a raw piece of wood. The raw material functions as a sculptural body, supporting the beautiful, vibrating surfaces typical of Camargo's repertoire. A dialogue is established between the body of the sculpture and its surface, between the organic textures of nature and the carefully crafted ornaments of art.
