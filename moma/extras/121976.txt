Trained in textile design, Hamilton often uses fabric in installations, sculptures, performances, video, photography, and works on paper. In these two prints she employed the material as a drawing tool. She distressed pieces of silk organza with a wire brush, creating rifts and disruptions in the regular weave of the fabric, and then pressed the textiles directly onto specially prepared printmaking plates, transferring the details in the organza directly onto the printing surface.
