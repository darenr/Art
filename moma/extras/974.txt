This house, designed for a couple and their three children, reflects the physical needs of the husband, who, following an automobile accident, uses a wheelchair. The architect conceived the project as three houses on top of one another. A very large lift, open on all sides, travels between the three levels. Like an itinerant room, it moves alongside a three-story wall of shelves that hold books, files, artworks, and wine within the husbands easy reach.
