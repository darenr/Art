This maquette, or model, was a design for a streetbased loudspeaker to be placed at city intersections, where it was to broadcast a speech by Lenin on the fifth anniversary of the Russian Revolution. Klutsis combined his interests in architectural design, posters, and typography, designing a kiosk on which Lenin's name is spelled out in bold red letters while the Russian words for "radio-announcer" and "speech" appear in black. As with other Russian Constructivists, such as Aleksandr Rodchenko and El Lissitzky, Klutsis sought to place art at the service of the new Socialist society and its early ideals. Striving for maximum legibility, he opted for bright colors and simple geometric forms.
