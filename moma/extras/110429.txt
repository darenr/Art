LOMAK is a device that assists people with physical impairments at the computer. "To use the keyboard, the operator controls a beam of light via a hand or head pointer to enter and then confirm key or mouse functions," explains the designer. Confirming each key ensures the correct selection is made, thereby reducing errors and increasing input speed.
