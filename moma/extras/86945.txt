Combining a Surrealist's interest in the unconscious with a postmodern sensibility, Herrera creates evocative collage drawings that are distinctively psychically charged. These amorphous works are typically composed from cut fragments from childrenâ€™s coloring books or comic illustrations, and often incorporate Disney characters and other recognizable cartoon icons. In A Knock Herrera uses his cut-and-paste technique to achieve a perfect balance between figuration and abstraction. For this work he has cut out fragments of figures based on the Disney characters Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs from a collaged, candy-colored background. The disjointed figures are not immediately recognizable and only emerge from clues within the flowing, linear web of paper strips: a hand holding a candle, a pickax, the tassel of a cap, fragments of clothing, and pieces of arms and legs. Images that are normally considered innocent and innocuous are placed in illogical juxtapositions, resulting in a morphed entity composed of multiple body parts. Herrera has created a nightmarish world in which childhood innocence has been subsumed by the unconscious.
