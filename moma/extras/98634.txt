Dion's sculptures and installations are based on the methods of categorization and display found in natural history museums and related sites. He filled this cabinet of curiosities with artifacts from an archaeological excavation in this Museum's Sculpture Garden; the drawings take the form of a page from a natural history textbook, and demonstrate Dion's classificatory and methodological systems.
