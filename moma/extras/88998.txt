The title of this proposal for a family house in the new suburb of Wiesbaden, near Frankfurt, is a reference to The Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (1499), a Renaissance text that intersperses a dreamlike narrative with descriptions of architectural escapes, garden follies, and designed landscapes. Similarly, Reiser and Umemotoâ€™s collages eschew realism for hybrid constructions that evoke an uneasy domesticity. The spaces of the house are discontinuous and irrational. A spiral staircase leads to a bridge, a precipitous corridor becomes an exit hatch, and a soft, fleshy tunnel tethers a platform to a totemic industrial chimney: ascent and descent map a fragmented and unsettling narrative.
