Picasso met Jacqueline Roque in 1953, when she worked in a sales position for the pottery studio where he made ceramics in the South of France. She was twenty-seven when they met; he was seventy-two. Roque moved in with Picasso in 1954; the couple married in 1961. They remained together until the artist’s death, in 1973, a relationship that for Picasso endured far longer than any other.This portrait represents Picasso's first use of linoleum cut for a major work of art. He first engaged with the medium in making posters, under the tutelage of master printer Hidalgo Arnéra at his workshop in the South of France.
