In direct dialogue with Nouveau Réalisme and Pop art, many of Broodthaers's early sculptures incorporate found objects. Unlike his American contemporaries, many of whom gravitated toward slick commercial products and mass-produced goods, the Belgian artist preferred more modest, domestic items. This work features a dress, a clothes hanger, and a paper shopping bag covered with eggshells, a material that appears frequently in Broodthaers's work from this period. "All is eggs," he explained. "The world is an egg. The world is born of the great yolk, the sun. And the belly of a wave is white. A heap of eggshells, the moon. Dust of eggshells the stars. All, dead eggs." Acquired on the day it was completed, Maria was the first work to enter the Daleds’ collection.
