Pechstein made this poster to advertise a short-lived journal, An die Laterne (To the lamp post), which promoted the incumbent Social Democratic Party. Its image of clenched-fisted, flag-carrying protestors—probably Communists—marching by a man hanged from a lamppost was a warning against the mob violence and anarchy that threatened to destabilize the fledgling Weimar Republic. Pechstein was one of the most politically engaged artists of the early postwar period.
