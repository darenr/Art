With The Iron Horse, director John Ford returned to his early film roots to make a Western, but one of epic size and scope. The heroic tale of the building of the first transcontinental railroad provides the historical backdrop for the story of Davy Brandon, a young surveyor for the Union Pacific, whose father had been murdered many years before while pursuing his own dream of a rail link between the East and the West. Character and landscape inform and subtly reflect one another as the story moves relentlessly toward the driving of the final spike near Promontory, Utah, in 1869. Ford foregrounds the ethnic diversity of the gangs that worked on the monumental project—giving pride of place, as always, to his beloved Irish—and shows how, in the face of adversity, the workers were able to overcome their differences and work together, becoming, in the process, a microcosm of the national ideal.
