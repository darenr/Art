This monumental drypoint refers, through its title, to a message sent from mother to son in a popular radio program for South African troops: "This message comes from your mother, with Casspirs full of love." Casspirs are armored personnel carriers; their name is an anagram of the abbreviations CSIR (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) and SAP (South African Police), the organizations that developed them. These vehicles, designed for international military operations, were deployed against South African civilians during apartheid.
