Celmins's depictions of expanses of ocean and sky are executed with a meticulous attention to detail that rivals photography. In Ocean Surface Woodcut 1992, she has manipulated the traditional medium of woodcut with incredible delicacy and precision to present a seascape unbounded by sky or land. "There is a feeling of timelessness that is implied in an image of an ocean that really has no boundaries," Celmins has commented. Through her work, she offers an expansive understanding of time and geography as seemingly limitless.
