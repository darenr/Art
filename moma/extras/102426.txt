McCarthy is best known for his elaborate performances. This monumental and expressive drawing is an extension of that practice, created on the floor of Edge Gallery in Fullerton, California. "It was an intentional decision," McCarthy said, "to do the drawing as an action."  The artist's interest in childhood, sexuality, and the body are hightlighted by strong, forceful lines that recall the physical creation of the work, as well as the narrative development of the figures.  Baby bottles, phallic forms, and various other images meld together in a frenzy of performative activity.
