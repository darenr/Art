In the early 1970s Morton was part of a wave of feminism that significantly informed her work, which flaunts qualities stereotypically associated with women—bright colors and open sentiment—as well as motifs like bows and flowers. Yet her texts can hint at the underside of a prettified femininity. This work also breaks down barriers between painting and sculpture and generally dispenses with aesthetic authority. In fact, in a list of likes and dislikes, Morton cited "good taste" as something "I hate."
