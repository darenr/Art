Vital often uses animal and other natural forms in his work, arranging them in surreal configurations. He often turns to lambs or goats, common in both his native village in rural Switzerland and in Agadez, Niger, where he keeps a home. This work is made from an imprint of the actual bodies of two lambs: he painted their fleeces with a printmaking solution, then laid the animals directly onto a large copper etching plate.
