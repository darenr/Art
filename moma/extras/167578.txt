In this example of contemporary digital collage, LTL presents its proposal for the New York waterfront (a response to climate change and rising sea levels) in three stages—as an initial pencil sketch on Mylar, as the color layer of a digital file in which the proposal is cut out from the surface of the water, and as a many–layered digital rendering. Occupying a zone between coast and sea, the project is a new landscape created by carving four “fingers” of land from an existing landfill site. These fingers are designed to accommodate hybrid uses, such as agriculture, aquaculture, and ecological research. The speculative nature of the ideas finds an adequate and appealing graphic language in the multilayered and overlapping method of collage.
