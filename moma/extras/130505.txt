Maciunas was the founder of the international art movement known as Fluxus. Throughout much of his career, Maciunas worked on developing a chart showing the evolution of alternative art forms, placing Cage in a central position in his 1973 Diagram of Historical Development of Fluxus and Other 4 Dimentional, Aural, Optic, Olfactory, Epithelial and Tactile Art Forms. While Cageâ€™s work is represented in only a few early Fluxus concerts, he was influential to the movement as a pioneering mentor and as someone from whom to break away.
