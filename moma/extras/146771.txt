A performance and installation artist, Burden based this portfolio of digital prints and etchings on his encounters with coyotes near his home in Topanga Canyon, just outside Los Angeles. Working at Jacob Samuel's Santa Monica print studio, Burden wrote the stories on legal pads, which Samuel printed digitally to directly reproduce the artist's handwriting.  For the etchings, Samuel suggested that Burden work on the surfaces of the copper plates without traditional etching tools; experimenting with this idea, the artist pressed objects described in the stories, such as knives or a wallet, into the soft ground.
