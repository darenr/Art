The symmetrical blocks in the center of the gallery are plaster casts of the space beneath an ordinary double bed, with four round holes demarcating the space once occupied by the bed's legs. Whiteread is known for casting domestic objects and their surrounding spaces, such as the undersides of tables, the interior of a bathtub, and even an entire row house in London's East End. The resulting works reconfigure our encounters with familiar objects and spaces, inviting us to see what is not there or to notice details that are normally hidden.
