Hirshfield painted Girl in a Mirror after seeing The Dream (1910), by Henri Rousseau, another self-taught artist, here at The Museum of Modern Art. Hirshfield was greatly influenced by the painting, but he was dissatisfied with Rousseau's treatment of the female figure, finding its contours overly rounded, and he proposed a different type of nude in response. In this work a woman stands facing a mirror that, instead of reflecting the front of her body, shows her back. The symmetry of the doubled body shapes, the highly stylized flowers at the womanâ€™s feet, and the ambiguously rendered interior space, with no clear distinction between wall and floor, work together to form a kind of surface pattern across the canvas. Though Hirshfield did not paint from live models, he was particularly interested in the anatomical details of the female figure and felt his renderings were "better than a camera could do."
