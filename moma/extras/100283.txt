Biosphere #4 is bordered by the distinctive heavy, dark frame with stenciled title that has appeared consistently in Neil Jenneyâ€™s work since 1969. "The scenes of rocks and trees, with an ominous mushroom cloud, are crowded by the tight picture frame," Jenney has said, "which in itself becomes a threatening signal." The biosphere theme evolved from drawings of a tree juxtaposed with those of a cloud that the artist made in his notebooks in 1971. Repeatedly reworking these tree and cloud motifs, Jenney produced several versions of this theme over the course of many years.
