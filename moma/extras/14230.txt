A Is an Alphabet is one of the first of numerous whimsical books and portfolios based on his drawings that Warhol published in the 1950s. His friend Corkie (Ralph Thomas Ward) wrote the verses, and Warhol created drawings based on tracings he made of photographs from Life magazine and other sources. Those featuring boys with long eyelashes or pairs of men exemplify the undercurrent of homoeroticism in some of Warhol's works.
