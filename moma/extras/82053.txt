Here Oldenburg has rendered a hard object in a soft material so that it sags and droops, and he has greatly inflated its size. There is humor in this transformation of a hard machine into a collapsible object, and the result has a bodily and sexual connotation. There is also a subtle nostalgia: in its focus on the culture of its time, Pop art seemed jarringly up-to-date in the 1960s, but this fanâ€™s design was old-fashioned even then.
