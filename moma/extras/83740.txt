This print, which the artist made shortly after his discharge from military service following a nervous breakdown, represents the riding instruction Kirchner had received as part of his training. The anxiety he felt about his service is conveyed in the nervous energy of his gestural style. Kirchner suffered from medical and psychological problems for the rest of his life as a result of the war; he committed suicide in 1938.
