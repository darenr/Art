In 1939, Goodwin, a member of The Museum of Modern Art's Board of Trustees and an architect practicing in the traditional Beaux-Arts style, teamed with Stone, an ardent modernist, to create a building appropriate to the Museum's mission. The resulting design fulfilled many of the criteria of the International Style as outlined in the Museum's 1932 show Modern Architecture: International Exhibition. The six-story structure is a white marble box with a glass-walled base, two levels of galleries with translucent glazing, and upper-level offices with horizontal strip windows. When completed, the building formed a striking contrast to the neighboring townhouses on Fifty-third Street. The inaugural exhibition in the building was Art in Our Time, celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of The Museum of Modern Art in 1929. The 2004 expansion of the Museum, designed by Yoshio Taniguchi, restored many original features of the 1939 building that had been modified by subsequent building projects. This original model forms an interesting comparison with the model of Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye.
