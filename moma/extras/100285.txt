In this untitled painting, New Yorkâ€“based artist Bob Kane depicted a table with anemones and wine glasses in front of his studio window, which shows a view of the Hudson River. This is a scene that he has painted over fifty times since the 1960s, with the details and quality of light changing with the time of day and the season. Here, Kane simplified the details of his scene, eliminated shadow, and emphasized the flatness of the picture plane.
