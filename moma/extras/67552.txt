In this work Johns plays with perceptual cues, posing the linguistic against the visual by mismatching the words for colors with the inks they are printed inâ€”for example, writing the word "yellow" in blue ink. Johns printed a second composition in grays and black using the same stones, a strategy that became one of his common practices in printmaking.
