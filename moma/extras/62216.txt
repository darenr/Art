Flipper is a German term for the game of pinball, which was Palermo’s favorite pastime at his local café. The right–hand panel of this diptych features the same red, white, and blue pattern that appeared on the sides of the pinball machine he used there. In the left panel the elimination of the blue grid leaves the red squares floating unanchored on the white ground, creating formal tension in the composition.
