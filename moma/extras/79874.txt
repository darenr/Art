By slashing the center of his canvases, Fontana allowed three–dimensional space to intrude into an otherwise two–dimensional surface. Fontana first introduced perforations within his works in 1949 and referred to these as "spatial concepts." He then began slashing his canvases in the early 1950s and added the term "Expectations" to the title. While these works immediately conjure acts of violence and iconoclasm, Fontana claimed "I have constructed, not destroyed."
