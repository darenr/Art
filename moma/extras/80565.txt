Eliminating the figures and organic imagery that dominate earlier paintings, in the late 1940s Rothko began to focus on the relationship between space, color, and scale in paintings that later became known as Multiforms. In this work Rothko applied thin washes of paint to canvas to create a multitude of irregular forms that ebb and flow across the picture plane. Its large size and abstract style point toward the artistâ€™s signature Color Field paintings, which he began a year after completing this work.
