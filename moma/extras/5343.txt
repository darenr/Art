"For some reason (probably clear to a psychiatrist) four design projects in which I have recently been involved have all had a strong emphasis on sex in the form of the female anatomy," remarked Brownjohn in his 1964 article "Sex and Typography," published in the avant-garde magazine Typographica. The four projects include this exhibition poster as well as the title sequences for the James Bond films From Russia with Love (1963) and Goldfinger (1964), projects that demonstrate the ease with which Brownjohn moved between still and moving graphic design concepts. Brownjohn, who had a cheerful enthusiasm for Playboy magazine, said that his "disordered" mind helped him produce his own compositions, which integrate sex and modern typography with a commercial or narrative message.
