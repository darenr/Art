Made of glass, this life-size crib threatens any child in its care with shattering collapse and inevitable injury. In spite of its title, neither the crib nor the child would be likely to remain silent for long. The translucent glass tubes evoke medical paraphernalia and the human circulatory system; Hatoum has an ongoing interest in the vulnerability of the body. She has said, "I see furniture as being very much about the body. It is usually about giving it support and comfort," but Silence is part of a series of furniture pieces the artist made which are more hostile than comforting. Here, as in much of her work, Hatoum seeks to strike a balance "between beauty and danger."
