This monumental drawing reinterprets The Battle of Rorke's Drift (1981), a linocut by John Muafangejo depicting a key battle in the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, a turning point in securing Britain's colonial rule in South Africa. Here Platter replaces a representation of carnage between the Zulus and the British with enchantment and debauchery in a KwaZulu-Natal nightclub.
