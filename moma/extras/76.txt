Hans Poelzig made this drawing for a concert hall while he was the city architect of Dresden, a position he held from 1916 to 1920. A painter and set designer as well as an architect, he searched for personal and emotional architectural forms. Natural, organic, plantlike elements create a fanciful and romantic setting, and almost baroque ornamental patterns radiate from the stage, their rhythm evoking the music they were designed to house.
