In Cubi X gleaming stainless steel rectangles and squares of various dimensions are assembled to evoke the human figure. Despite its monumental scale, the organization of the asymmetrical forms onto a variety of spatial planes—vertical, tilted, or horizontal—leads the eye upward, against gravity. Between 1961 and 1965, Smith made a series of twenty–eight sculptures that he termed "Cubi." The name, which Smith invented, links them to Cubism. The geometric shapes, their two–dimensional orientation, and the shimmering effects of the polished and scratched stainless steel surfaces recall the paintings of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque from the early twentieth century.
