This electrostatic loudspeaker is distinguished by its large, light membrane, meant to symbolize the clarity of its sound. It is representative of the remarkable range of clean and elegant designs for which Dieter Rams is famous, all shaped by his steadfast philosophy, "Omit the unimportant." Rams was the primary force in developing the modern design program at the German appliance company Braun, which he joined in 1955 and led for almost thirty years as head of design. He secured Braun's success in the postwar consumer electronics market, creating esteemed series of radios, record players, bathroom scales, fans, food mixers, space heaters, slide projectors, calculators, hair dryers, toasters, juicers, and lighters. Rams gave utmost consideration to the interests and needs of the user, valuing comprehensibility and enjoyment at the same level as advanced engineering.
