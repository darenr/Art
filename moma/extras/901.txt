Aldo Rossi's unbuilt housing scheme for Setubal, a fishing town outside of Lisbon, was designed for a site that gently slopes toward a coastal highway. While the building's base follows the topography, the roofline remains constant, stepping down once near the mid-point and creating two giant steps in the landscape. The lower building becomes a terrace overlooking the sea. As the ground recedes, Rossi's characteristic rectilinear forms are supported on pilotis, which create covered walkways with adjacent shops and community facilities. A water tower, echoing the industrial setting, marks an entrance to the building, while other similar cylindrical structures flag locations where streets cross below.
