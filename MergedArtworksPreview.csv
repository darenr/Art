Not wanting to displace the city below, Friedman raised a second city fifteen to twenty meters above the existing one. The framework was to be erected first, and the residences conceived and built by the inhabitants inserted into the voids of the structure. The layout of each level would occupy no more than fifty percent of the overall structure in order to provide air and light to each residence as well as to the city below. The project was designed for construction anywhere, and meant to be adapted to any climate."

The pods could be connected by retractable corridors and, together, form a conglomerate metropolis. This literally mobile and indeterminate architecture was not so much a serious proposition for a structure as a commentary on the way in which change dominates every aspect of the modern city."

The form begins with an image or a fiction; in this case, the section recalls a fountain and the plan a face. The architecture is meant to transform the real environment into a space that approaches the imaginary, a place where beauty is primary."

Although it was never realized, unlike other visionary projects of the 1960s it was fully intended to be built. Designed as a flexible framework into which programmable spaces can be plugged, the structure has as its ultimate goal the possibility of change at the behest of its users. Price belonged to a generation of British architects and educators who used architecture both to address the future and as the ultimate social art. Price's personal vision of the city was inventive and playful and expressed his sense of architecture’s moral obligations toward its users. Price was fascinated by new technology and believed that it should both serve the public and further human freedom. He was determined that his work would not impose physical or psychological constraints upon its occupants nor reduce them to a standard form—unlike typical modern architecture."

At key points in the ""transportation corridor"" (central hub, bridge or tunnel entries) there were multilevel, stacking pedestrian plazas, people movers, and parking—all above and below existing bridge and rail systems. Tall, stepped-back residential buildings would provide light, air, and views, flanking the corridor at these gateways, and in conjunction with new building types, could become generators of urban space."

In this early work, Ligon incorporates his characteristic use of language, investigating and manipulating the immense power of words. Later, in the 1990s, Ligon appropriated literary texts by black authors such as Ralph Ellison and James Baldwin. In this work he refers to a comment made in the New York Times about Martin Puryear, another contemporary African American artist: ""There is a consciousness we all have that he is a black American artist but I think his work is really superior and stands on its own.""By stenciling this sentence in capital letters across two adjacent sheets of paper, Ligon purposefully and effectively creates disruptive breaks in the text, further disconnecting the sentence from any concrete reference to Puryear's work and forcefully pointing out the misguided practice of using race as a factor in judging the quality of a work of art. Furthermore, painted in light ochre, the words are not easily legible against the background, and only through a concerted effort can the text be read. Through such moments of discontinuity and ambiguity, Ligon has created an ironic and provocative visual statement about the critical reception of black artists and perceptions of race in general."

Her color photographs of family and friends were made with a large-format camera on a tripod, but they are imbued with a sense of intimacy and informality that connects them to the tradition of family snapshots.In 1996 Barney turned her attention across the Atlantic. In Austria, Italy, England, France, Spain, and Germany she photographed the aristocratic equivalent of the elite society in which she lived and worked in the United States, but in Europe these individuals and families were frequently strangers to her, introduced through an intermediary. While her American photographs often have the sitters' given names as titles, underscoring their familiarity, for her European work Barney frequently chose titles that relate to details in the settings: for instance, The Yellow Wall.The photographs that constitute The Europeans, as this body of work came to be called, are more akin to painted still lifes than to her earlier work, with its seemingly improvised character. In these photographs there is a formality, an attention to color, space, and subtlety of manner that befits old-world nobility and is related to the Old Master paintings frequently hanging in the subjects' homes."

These etchings, for example, are from a portfolio inspired by the Surrealist game of chance known as Exquisite Corpse, in which a sheet of paper is folded into four parts corresponding to the head, chest, trunk, and legs of a human body. Each player draws one section and then conceals it before passing it on to the next. In that manner the two brothers took turns drawing on prepared etching plates to make this portfolio. Combining horror with humor and clearly relishing the minute, obsessive details that are possible in etching, the Chapmans concocted the hallucinatory figures in this series by connecting various bizarre, incongruous, and often sexualized or scatological forms."
