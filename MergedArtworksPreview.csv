Lauder","2","In 1895 Otto Wagner, the leading Viennese architect of his time, declared: ""The only possible point of departure for our artistic creation is modern life."" As shown in this drawing, Wagner's design for the Ferdinandsbrücke, a bridge named in honor of Archduke Francis Ferdinand, is one of his frankest expressions of the techniques of modern engineering. The bridge's steel truss spans the Danube Canal in a low, broad arch. Decorating the naked steel structure are imperial emblems—coats of arms, wreaths, and garlands—particularly appropriate for Vienna, which was the capital of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the turn of the century.Wagner argued for simplicity and a new ""realist"" style, which implied that designers should use modern materials and clear methods of construction. He gave shape to his ideas in the many buildings and projects he designed in Vienna, as the city expanded outside its medieval boundaries. Although the Ferdinandsbrücke was not built according to his design, Wagner's prolific output and progressive ideas influenced an entire generation and firmly established him as one of the forefathers of modern architecture."

In 1967, on the recommendation of Philip Johnson, a committee charged with building such a memorial in New York City commissioned Louis Kahn to design it. The monument was to be situated in Battery Park, at the southern tip of Manhattan, where it would have distant views of the Statue of Liberty. Kahn proposed an abstract design: a granite pedestal supporting seven glass piers, so that, in his words, ""the sun could come through and leave a shadow filled with light."" This spectacular image, the sole drawing included in an exhibition devoted to the Memorial at The Museum of Modern Art in 1968, captures the sense of transparency and reflection that Kahn envisioned through loose, energetic strokes of charcoal pencil on the luminous yellow paper. The drawing focuses on the central glass pier, made of glass blocks etched with inscriptions in Hebrew and English, and built to contain a small circular chapel. Around this central space are the other six piers, all of them solid glass. Kahn described the immaterial quality these vitreous forms would have: ""Changes of light, the seasons of the year, the play of the weather, and the drama of movement on the river will transmit their life to the monument."" This structure of light embodied hope as well as despair. The project is contemporary with one of Kahn's last philosophical concepts, ""silence and light,"" where light symbolizes the source of life and the inspiration of the creative act."

Intended as a temporary ceremonial structure, the three-sided bamboo and canvas construction was designed to be a lavish representation of monarchy rather than a purely functional object. Kammerer's symbolic architectural language includes sculptural papyrus-leaf motifs and silk tapestries depicting hunting scenes lining the tent's interior. Stenciled patterning adorns the exterior walls. Kammerer was a student of the Austrian architect Otto Wagner, whose instruction in the incorporation of art, architecture, and design within a Gesamtkunstwerk—a “total work of art”—is evident in the aesthetic qualities of this meticulously wrought drawing. Kammerer went on to become a renowned painter and architect."
