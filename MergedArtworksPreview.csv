Lauder","2","In 1895 Otto Wagner, the leading Viennese architect of his time, declared: ""The only possible point of departure for our artistic creation is modern life."" As shown in this drawing, Wagner's design for the Ferdinandsbrücke, a bridge named in honor of Archduke Francis Ferdinand, is one of his frankest expressions of the techniques of modern engineering. The bridge's steel truss spans the Danube Canal in a low, broad arch. Decorating the naked steel structure are imperial emblems—coats of arms, wreaths, and garlands—particularly appropriate for Vienna, which was the capital of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the turn of the century.Wagner argued for simplicity and a new ""realist"" style, which implied that designers should use modern materials and clear methods of construction. He gave shape to his ideas in the many buildings and projects he designed in Vienna, as the city expanded outside its medieval boundaries. Although the Ferdinandsbrücke was not built according to his design, Wagner's prolific output and progressive ideas influenced an entire generation and firmly established him as one of the forefathers of modern architecture."

In 1967, on the recommendation of Philip Johnson, a committee charged with building such a memorial in New York City commissioned Louis Kahn to design it. The monument was to be situated in Battery Park, at the southern tip of Manhattan, where it would have distant views of the Statue of Liberty. Kahn proposed an abstract design: a granite pedestal supporting seven glass piers, so that, in his words, ""the sun could come through and leave a shadow filled with light."" This spectacular image, the sole drawing included in an exhibition devoted to the Memorial at The Museum of Modern Art in 1968, captures the sense of transparency and reflection that Kahn envisioned through loose, energetic strokes of charcoal pencil on the luminous yellow paper. The drawing focuses on the central glass pier, made of glass blocks etched with inscriptions in Hebrew and English, and built to contain a small circular chapel. Around this central space are the other six piers, all of them solid glass. Kahn described the immaterial quality these vitreous forms would have: ""Changes of light, the seasons of the year, the play of the weather, and the drama of movement on the river will transmit their life to the monument."" This structure of light embodied hope as well as despair. The project is contemporary with one of Kahn's last philosophical concepts, ""silence and light,"" where light symbolizes the source of life and the inspiration of the creative act."

Intended as a temporary ceremonial structure, the three-sided bamboo and canvas construction was designed to be a lavish representation of monarchy rather than a purely functional object. Kammerer's symbolic architectural language includes sculptural papyrus-leaf motifs and silk tapestries depicting hunting scenes lining the tent's interior. Stenciled patterning adorns the exterior walls. Kammerer was a student of the Austrian architect Otto Wagner, whose instruction in the incorporation of art, architecture, and design within a Gesamtkunstwerk—a “total work of art”—is evident in the aesthetic qualities of this meticulously wrought drawing. Kammerer went on to become a renowned painter and architect."

Here, architecture takes on an intellectual role that is distanced from the constraints of reality—a seemingly apolitical attitude that is itself an entrenched statement on the cultural power of design. Thus, elements such as columns and walls are separated from an aesthetic and functional context and used as part of a notational system. The inscription at the lower left of this work —“Building may be the mere representation of an idea first stated in drawing”—indicates the primacy of drawing in Eisenman’s thought process. The sequence of axonometric drawings acts as a diagram for the transformation of a basic cube into a highly developed spatial configuration; shelter is the result of cerebral processes that speak of architecture’s ability to generate its own logic and authority."

On one side of Graves's bridge, in Fargo, lie a concert hall and a public-radio and television station; an interpretive center for the region's cultural heritage lies on the other; and an art museum, shown in this drawing, bridges the two. The drawing is what Graves terms ""definitive"": preceded by referential and preparatory drawings that are incomplete and fragmentary, it reflects the final proposal for the built object through dimension, proportion, and detail. Graves's palette of terra-cotta and blue visually reinforces the significance of the building as a bridge, an extension of the earth situated midway between sky and water. Inversions of architectural elements do the same: voids in what would traditionally be the sites of keystones, and columns displaced from the sides of arches to their centers, transmit the light above to the water below. In the case of the center column, this vertical connection is literally constructed: the column's capital appears visually as a window of light supported by a shaft of water. Graves's work, often called ""postmodern"", is a departure from the functionalist and formal foundations of the International Style. It was significantly influenced by the notion of the architectural sign theorized by Robert Venturi in Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture (1966): like Venturi, Graves uses architectural elements representationally rather than structurally or functionally. He is a painter as well as an architect, and his use of drawing alone as a medium through which to design echoes the ""pure visibility"" of his architecture, in which meaning is collapsed onto the facade in a pastiche of color and form."

The theme of the 1930 exhibition was ""Housing, Transportation, Furnishing,"" and it focused on industrial responses to the needs of Sweden's growing middle class. The exhibition committee sent Asplund on a tour of continental Europe in the autumn of 1928 for design inspiration. Upon his return to Sweden, Asplund designed the complex in the modernist International Style, a radical departure from the classicism of his earlier projects, such as the Stockholm Public Library. The tower recalls similar designs by Russian Constructivists, but rather than revolutionary slogans, it supports advertisements for chocolates, scarves, and radios by major manufacturers."

In a drawing by Asplund from 1937, showing the northern part of the site, the entrance to the cemetery is represented by a semicircle on the right side of the drawing. From here, a walled allée marks a strong axial movement to the south, interrupted when it opens to present the visitor with a tranquil rolling landscape devoid of graves. Asplund and Lewerentz studied this entry sequence carefully, establishing it as both monumental and contemplative to communicate the importance of nature, to which all living things ultimately return. As Asplund had in devising the walled and forested precinct around the Woodland Chapel (the rectangular form on the left side of drawing), which is discreetly surrounded by the crematorium and other ancillary buildings, they saved monumentality for the landscape, rather than trying to achieve it through any structure or object. By the time of Asplund's death, in 1940, the architects had transformed their forested site into a modern sanctuary for death and bereavement.

Scott Fitzgerald. Trying to merge his roots with his culture of adoption, he longed for an architecture that would combine American technology and energy with French humanism and sophistication. He was indeed instrumental in introducing European modern architecture to the United States, and also in bringing American flair and taste for the spectacular to France. After taking his license at the Ècole des Beaux-Arts in 1927, Nelson became a member of the School of Paris, the eclectic group of modernist architects that also included Robert Mallet-Stevens. His project for the Palais de la Découverte, represented in this perspective drawing, arose after the scientific exhibit at Paris's 1937 International Exposition greatly impressed authorities in the French government. As a result, Nelson and his colleagues Oscar Nitzchke and Frantz Jourdain were commissioned to produce a study for a permanent science museum in the city. The project, unfortunately never realized, envisioned a structure that was as functional as it was monumental, the outer envelope being designed to contain diverse exhibits with quite different spatial needs. Tensile cables anchored in the central ovoid shell support the circular cantilevered roof. The architects"" ideals and aspirations are evident in the clear lines of the drawing, which portrays a building for a positivist, technocratic institution."

The project, for four intersecting and overlapping bridges containing usable space as well as acting as passageways, was intended to foster economic development: in Holl's scheme, community members would earn incomes by working on organized recreational activities housed in the bridges—rowing, ice skating, basketball, boxing, and so on—and these activities would in turn attract visitors and custom to the area. Thus the Gymnasium Bridge would not only serve a physical purpose but act as ""a vehicle from which destitute persons can reenter society."" This drawing shows three views of the bridge: a plan of the upper level of the main span, a plan of the lower level of all four bridges, and an exterior perspective. The plan of the lower level doubles as a site plan and is continuous with the exterior perspective, while the plan of the upper level is isolated at the top of the drawing. The predominance of the site plan reflects Holl's belief that ""architecture and site should have an experiential connection, a metaphysical link, a poetic link."" The darkness of the site contrasts with the luminosity of the structure, casting the bridge as a beacon of hope in the community. This was an early project for Holl. Drawing has always been an important tool in his conception and development of his projects; his renderings, often in watercolor, illustrate his understanding of how the senses perceive architectural spaces. Phenomenology has made appearances in Holl's writings, and as a result of his focus on the human relationship to architecture, his practice is often linked to this philosophical study of reality as it is understood and experienced by the human consciousness."

Its relatively small scale and standard program allowed and even inspired architects to experiment with architectural components such as material and spatial articulation, even while retaining the original function as shelter. Paul Rudolph's exploration of the house began when he was a student at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design. Following the teaching of Walter Gropius, Rudolph followed the formal and structural principles of the International Style, which included clarity, a strict adherence to function, and an unambiguous expression of individual parts. These guiding principles are instrumental in his design of the Finney Guest House, an unbuilt project in South Florida. He began studies for the house in 1947, while he was still a student, then continuued to work on it until around 1949. In this impeccably rendered drawing, Rudolph clearly communicates not only his design ideas for the guest house but also the reason for the drawing itself, which is ""always to inform the act of building"". Choosing wood and glass as his primary material palette, Rudolph carefully arranges rectangular roof and floor planes into a spatial composition suspended above the water and surrounding landscape. The glazed walls, penetrated by indirect and filtered light, would almost allow one to feel that one was in the landscape rather than indoors, a quality in which they recall other glass houses designed several years earlier by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson. Rudolph later came to find International Style dicta wanting, feeling that they did not fully consider the psychological aspect of space—how individuals use and inhabit it. The function of a space, he would argue, varies with each person, so that his buildings became ""perpetual statements on the nature of architecture""—for him, “a continuing, ever-integrating, altering, deepening enigma.”"

The distinctive sweeping lines of his drawings were intended to capture the immediate appearance of the whole. Mendelsohn's architectural ideas were shaped in the chaotic climate of Germany in the period around World War I, and most dramatically by his close association with leaders of the Expressionist movement. Even his signature style of rendering was developed during his army service in the war: tracing paper was scarce, so he began to use thumbnail sketches to portray the large complexes of his design imagination. This early sketch for Jerusalem's Hadassah University Hospital was made in 1935, the same year Mendelsohn emigrated to Palestine. He was still working out the design, which would go through many more variations. The final complex of buildings, which includes a nursing school and a research institute as well as a hospital, stands on Mount Scopus, overlooking the ancient walled city of Jerusalem and the Moab Mountains. The drawing reveals Mendelsohn's ongoing preoccupation with the plasticity of reinforced concrete, as well as his interest in observation points affording scenic views. As this drawing shows, he was equally concerned with impressive views of the buildings from vantage points below. His consistent choice of exterior perspectives as his primary tools for describing a building, rather than the plans and elevations preferred by most modernist architects, reinforced his vision of the project as an entirety: ""My sketches are data, the contour lines of an instantaneous vision. In accordance with their architectural nature, their immediate appearance is that of a whole, and this is how they must be taken."""

This drawing shows a series of transverse sections extending from a plan of the building's lower level, tracing the path from the car's rearview mirror (symbolizing travel away from the city) to the house’s cherished water view. The section images show how the house arcs from the entry facade, which is just wider than the front door, to the double-height picture window framing the view. The split passage between the first and second levels, the building's horizontal curve, and the torqued outer wall of the house thwart direct visual access to this view at the structure's southwest end, slowing the visitor's approach to it. The architects have explained that the house ""is conceived as a passage, a door that leads to a window . . . a physical entry to an optical departure.""Challenging the conventions of architectural representation, Diller and Scofidio executed this drawing on a translucent sheet mounted on a wooden board and left drawing equipment attached to the final product."

Hadid proposed a transformation of the site itself by excavating the hills and using the excavated rock to build artificial cliffs. Into this new topography, she interjected cantilevered beams, shardlike fragments, and other elements that seemed to splinter the structure into its myriad constituent parts, as if it had been subjected to some powerful de–stabilizing force.Seemingly defiant of gravity, the forms of Hadid's project hover and float, animated by the same visionary power that marked the ground–breaking Constructivist structures that Vladimir Tatlin, El Lissitzky, and Moisei Ginzburg imagined would arise in a new, postrevolutionary Soviet society. That seeming instability, which can also be found in the works of a number of other architects active in the 1980s, has been related to the literary movement of deconstruction, whose principal interpreter, the French philosopher Jacques Derrida, has become a familiar figure within contemporary debates on architectural theory."

Promoting ""messy vitality over obvious unity,"" in part through the use of such punchy slogans as ""Less is a bore,"" Venturi spoke for an architecture favoring multiple meanings over consolidated form. He also revitalized professional interest in adapting historical styles and devices to contemporary use. Working with his colleagues John Rauch and Denise Scott Brown, Venturi designed this house for a family of three in northern Delaware, drawing on the vernacular domestic architecture of the region. The design, he has said, is particularly indebted to classic eighteenth-century barns, but these traditional buildings served more as inspiration than as sources to be literally imitated. In this drawing of the western facade, the lunette screen above and the Doric columns below are distorted in proportion and scale. In actuality these bulbous columns are thin, non-load-bearing planes of wood, as flat as the drawing itself. Symbolic rather than structural, they retain their associative power even when stripped of their functional one, and the facade becomes a stage set for the dramatization of domesticity and the local architectural heritage."

He was fascinated by the Cannaregio, a distressed area of the city that had suffered damage from bombs in World War I, and for which Le Corbusier designed an unrealized hospital in 1967. Abraham envisioned a new Venice free of historical pastiche, which would intensify the original elements of the city—the lagoon, winding canals with stone bridges, and the interplay between light and shadow. Like many architects in the 1970s, Abraham was interested in the essential nature of architecture and the topographical forms of the built environment. He wrote texts to accompany his drawings, which he considered to be autonomous works, not auxiliary to the act of building. Of his Hospital project he wrote, ""Outer walls are torn open by gates to pass through images/forms/imprints/passages dissecting the House of Hope crossing the hidden rivers of the opaque Lagoon connecting the Houses of Birth with the Houses of No Return."""

The museum is located in a region containing over 200 burial mounds, or kofun, from that era, and there are a number of archaeological sites in the building's immediate neighborhood, which has been designated a historical park. As far as possible, then, Ando's design preserves the park's topography, altering it minimally through the use of architectural elements that serve more than one function: the building's roof doubles as sets of stairs leading up to an observation tower and plaza, together constituting stepped viewing platforms from which to look at the tombs in their natural surroundings. The concept focuses, Ando has said, ""on architecture's power to produce a new landscape"": like a large berm, the museum becomes an integral part of the landscape that the museum also serves to exhibit. Inside the building, objects excavated from the burial mounds are exhibited in a darkened interior, evoking the interiors of the tombs in which they were discovered. Ando's use of concrete as a construction material recalls the work of Le Corbusier and Louis Kahn, his architectural mentors, yet he combines this preference with a Japanese aesthetic of contrast-light and dark, interior and exterior, enclosed and expansive, hard and soft, nature and city, east and west. The subtle interplay of these opposites in Ando's buildings produces rich environments, and some of this is captured in the drawing: the hard-edged graphite lines marking the imposed, man-made structure offer a counterpoint to the softer shades of color depicting the enveloping landscape that Ando seeks to echo."

The program required three principal spaces, respectively accommodating 100, 500, and 2,000 people, and all flexible enough to serve multiple purposes, from concerts to conventions. The hall was to be the centerpiece of a series of structures planned for the city and prefecture of Nara, the master plan for which was drawn up by Kisho Kurokawa. Isozaki's main structure takes the form of a gigantic ellipse that extends the length of the site. In the sketch plan the ellipse is first set along the axis of the city's preexisting grid, then is rotated twenty-three degrees, forming an entrance hall parallel to an adjacent railway station. The sculptural form tapers gently toward the roof (a vast field of glass-tube solar collectors). Though the form of the building is abstract, its curving profile and ponderous presence relate to the monumental roof forms of Nara's most notable monument, the Todaiji Temple, constructed in 734 A.D. Its exterior skin, sheathed in zinc and gray-ceramic tile, also recalls the dull luster of the traditional gray ibushi-style roofs of Todaiji and other important temple structures. The sketch and the computer-generated drawing, both of which appeared in an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art in 1992–93, together show the full range of graphic techniques available to Isozaki at the time. The sketch portrays the signature dimension of architectural design in its most generative form; the computer drawing is less personal, depicting not the act of generation but the end result of a long design process. Its cool tones and even surface render the qualities of the ceramic-tile skin, and provided a visual understanding of the total design well before construction was to begin.

Customers requesting plans and brochures from the Richards Company would have received prints like these illustrating the many house models from which they could have chosen. Modeled on Japanese woodblock prints, the style of Wright's lithographs evinces his life-long love of Japanese art. The high horizon line, the planar flatness of foreground and sky, the silhouetted foliage, and the red square (or ""chop"") framed by the text-all suggest a studied japonisme. Most likely the originals were prepared by Antonin Raymond, Wright's assistant on the contemporary Imperial Hotel project in Tokyo. The System-Built Houses were Wright's first experiment with mass production. Like many modern architects, he confronted both the benefits of the rationalized standardization associated with machine production and the desire for individual expression. ""Individuality is a national ideal"", Wright proclaimed in 1910, and for him this ideal was symbolized by the American house. Thus he developed a system that allowed variety within an overall unity. Regardless of house size and plan, most of the details were ""conventionalized"", a term Wright applied to a principle of abstracting form to its essentials. The houses were constructed of wood framing, floors, joists, rafters, roofs, and trim. To streamline the construction process, lumber was measured and precut in the Richards Company factory, then shipped to the site where it was to be assembled, thus saving the contractor and the customer time and money. Wright liked to give his houses descriptive names, for example La Miniatura (pp. 62-63), but the System-Built Houses bear perfunctory labels, such as D101. There were dozens of models, ranging from one to three stories, and the isometric plans illustrate numerous room configurations as well as ideas on how to furnish them. The designs recall Wright's earlier Prairie Houses, named for the landscape of his native Midwest. The characteristic low cantilevered roofs, the linear wood trim visually unifying the stucco wall planes, and the geometric decoration of the art-glass windows constitute a compelling modern alternative to the typical suburban bungalow. An untold number of System-Built Houses were built, mostly in the Midwest. In the following decades Wright continued to experiment with a range of materials and construction systems in an effort to reduce the expense of house building and to give industrialized methods character, expression, and personality."

This color rendering depicts the Millard House in its lush surroundings. The house is constructed of a combination of plain-faced and ornamental concrete blocks, which were cast on the site from molds designed by Wright. The square blocks, with perforated, glass-filled apertures, form a continuous interior and exterior fabric. The relatively small scale of the blocks allows for a design that closely follows the contours of the landscape.In his autobiography, Wright wrote: ""The concrete block? The cheapest (and ugliest) thing in the building world. . . . Why not see what could be done with that gutter-rat?"" In his Textile Block houses, Wright attempted to introduce a flexible building system, marrying the merits of standardized machine production to the innovative, creative vision of the artist. While the block system was intended to be an efficient, low-cost method of building that incorporated ornament, it proved to be time consuming and more expensive than traditional construction."

Named after a short story by the eighteenth-century French historian and philosopher Voltaire, the Micromegas project began with eleven pencil drawings, which subsequently served as studies for a series of prints, including this one. ""An architectural drawing,"" Libeskind has written, ""is as much a prospective unfolding of future possibilities as it is a recovery of a particular history, to whose intentions it testifies and whose limits it always challenges. In any case a drawing is more than the shadow of an object, more than a pile of lines, more than a resignation to the inertia of convention."" In this print, Time Sections, projected fragments of architectural elements explode across the surface of the paper, illustrating no single moment but alluding to events in both the past and the future. Libeskind was once a serious musician—he was a concert violinist by the age of fifteen—and he did postgraduate work in philosophy and history."

The design involves the insertion of eleven found machinery parts into the shell of a preexisting bungalow. Reworked as functional elements—staircase, fireplace, shower—these innovative elements embody an imagined prehistory or archeology of the site. The complex operations characteristic of this and other early works by Mayne resonate with deconstruction’s philosophical goals, destabilizing normative procedures and producing new interpretations of cultural objects. As Mayne has said, his decontextualization of these different parts affirms “the presence of an artistic intervention” just as it “distorts scale, subverts typological expectations, and asserts functional neologisms.” Ultimately, they create an awareness of architecture’s potential to shift our perception of reality—opening up the possibility for transformation."
