The drawing illustrates an age in which people have settled in various underground pockets, drained of mineral oils and water and sealed off from the outside world by large stones. These “archeological remains” are meant to reflect essential conditions for living, such as “the exploitation of the interior of the planet,” “the importance of space,” “the necessity of isolation,” and “noncommunication as characteristic of human life.” The house is the subject of psychoanalytical and philosophical inquiry that discloses hidden political shades in its direct, if fictional, reflection of life."

Using sewing thread to mend gaps and create visual connections between her other materials, she questions division and opposition between inside and outside, positive and negative, black and white, and front and back. For her, both sides of a print and drawing are equally important: “I was intrigued by the space at the reverse side of the paper: what is behind it, what is out of sight—the other space of the absent, the latent, the concealed. I began to print both the front and backsides of the paper. Then, through cutting and folding, I was able to discover what was printed on the reverse and to incorporate it in the work together with the void left by the removal of the paper cut from it. Now the print did not only reside in the plane of the sheet, but by adding other dimensions became a graphic object.”"

Drawing plays a major role in her artistic practice and Fergie (A Quiet Life) is a signature example. With its photo–derived image, text from a gossipy tabloid, and famous subject, this drawing incorporates the central strands of Kilimnik's art, which typically blends sentimentality with irony in a critique of fame and media.Like many of the bygone pictorial styles Kilimnik ironically resurrects, royalty is itself a historical form with an arguably debased present, and the inclusion of the Duchess of York here demonstrates the ways in which Kilimnik generates considered (if biting) correspondences between the subjects of her art and its form. The intentionally flat forms in the drawings (which typically include very little shading) not only refer to the constrained possibilities for handmade art after the age of mechanical reproduction, but also to the vapidity and fleetingness of the fame of their subjects. These themes are reflected too in the ""casually"" handwritten transcription of a gossip-column report that occupies the right-hand side of the sheet. This text, which addresses issues of class and new world / old world tensions, is simultaneously catty and playful while also clearly ironic and critical."

Instead of using the paper to register an image, he abrades, burns, punctures, or otherwise manipulates it, accepting as the final work the paper’s chemical and physical responses to these excoriations. To make Pan (C-279) he first exposed and developed the sensitized paper, turning it black. Then he scored it with a sharp blade to get at the minutely differentiated layers of color—cyan, magenta, black, and yellow—in the paper's emulsion. The highlights were achieved by scattering grains of sand beneath the paper at the time of scoring, giving the impression of volume to the flat surface.Breuer's process of breaking down the paper to reveal its physical components offers a rare glimpse into what makes color photography possible. His visually lush and elegantly simple pictures often look more like paintings or drawings than photographs. Built line by line through a process of subtraction, this work recalls Agnes Martin's exquisitely handcrafted painted surfaces and Gerhard Richter's squeegee-scrape paintings. Breuer's experimental aesthetic also belongs to the tradition of cameraless photography (or photogram) that stretches from inventor William Henry Fox Talbot through Man Ray and László Moholy-Nagy to the present."

The principal elements of each tower are a twenty-foot-square concrete core and two or more column-free volumes of habitable space that wrap around it. The supporting framework is a diagonally braced skin; its flexibility and strength allow the exterior tubes to expand and contract as they wrap around the core, producing the dynamic appearance of the ensemble. Each of the five towers is designed to be a self-supporting structure. Conjoined, they are able to resist tremendous forces through mutual support, and unlike a traditional freestanding vertical tower, they offer multiple routes of escape and firefighting access. A ""sky park"" creates a lofty horizon at the fifty-fifth floor, linking all the towers and bringing public access and social space to the highest common point of the five structures.The project celebrates the tall building as a technical and cultural artifact. The towers soar to an awe-inspiring height and create a remarkable silhouette across the skyline, a symbol of collectivity; their gaps frame views, channel circulation, and create monumental urban spaces, including public space at street level."

Working with a small team over the course of ten days, he cut the facade into nine equivalent rectangles then removed each one until only the central rectangle remained, like the central section of a Bingo card. Minutes after they finished the extraction, the house was razed. The artist retained three sections and deposited the remaining five in a nearby sculpture park, where he hoped they would be ""gradually reclaimed by the Niagara River Gorge.""Matta-Clark was raised in New York City, and he had witnessed firsthand the constant demolition of older buildings for the construction of new ones, the result of shifting real estate values. ""Work with abandoned structures,"" he wrote around 1974, ""began with my concern for the life of the city, of which a major side effect is the metabolization of old buildings."" The presence of empty and neglected buildings in urban centers is ""a reminder of the ongoing fallacy of renewal through modernization."""

Logos and symbols. Fairy tales and everyday scenes. Family crests and coats of arms. These are a few of the disparate subjects that McGinness fragments, alters, and layers to build his dense networks of brightly colored fantastical imagery. Swathed in ornate, curvaceous lines, McGinness's compositions are a postmodern twist on the eighteenth-century Rococo style, characterized by playful opulence and intricate, coiling forms.Though McGinness's work ranges from large-scale paintings, murals, and installations to smaller prints, multiples, and ephemera, screenprinting is fundamental to much of his output, enabling him to recycle imagery from work to work. This screenprint is from a series of one hundred that underscores the artist’s inventive approach to reproduction and replication. Hand-printed by McGinness using the same set of screens in different orientations and in varying colors, the series reads as a seemingly endless succession of multiplicity and meanings. Residing somewhere between abstraction and representation, the work incorporates bits of humor and social criticism, exploring how visual icons are interpreted—and invented—to shape beliefs in contemporary culture."

Like other large-scale residential projects at the time, the housing was designed for the Serviço de Apoio Ambulatório Local (SAAL), a government organization that addressed the lack of safe and affordable housing in Portugal after the revolution of 1974. Part of a greater planning intervention intended to renovate a densely packed neighborhood in the historical center of the city, the row of twelve houses fills the small site, adapting itself to the locale and offering an alternative for tabula rasa approaches to urban renovation. Poetically blending regional and modern references, the project demonstrates that a scarcity of resources can result in a resonant cultural and political architectural statement."

In the story, Abraham is injured in the derailment of a train and confined to an oxygen tent. He dies right after the foundations for the house are set (located on the spot where the accident occurred). The character is inspired by a passage of William Faulkner’s 1930 novel As I Lay Dying devoted to the death of a character named Addie Burnden. The allegorical nature of the drawing reveals Darden’s exploration of the narrative potential of architecture by weaving together heterogeneous elements like an intricate puzzle; it is also influenced by his own experience coping with terminal illness."

The project has seven chapters, incorporating 105 color photographs, twenty-six black-and-white text panels, and two slide projections. Chapter One documents the central role of the sea in the modern global economy, bringing together images from the world’s port cities. The photographs constitute a unique record of unemployment and dilapidation in the old industrial powers, the capitalist pursuit of cheap labor around the globe, and the strenuous work of seafaring."
