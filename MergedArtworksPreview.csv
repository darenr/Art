Kirk Askew, Jr.","11741","In 1918, Wolfgang Gurlitt published Die Samländische Ode (The Samland ode), an Expressionist lyric poem by Heinrich Lautensack with illustrations by Max Pechstein. In Lautensack's poem, written in 1915 while he was stationed with the German Army on the Baltic coast, the incursions of modern life—soldiers and telegraph poles—have barely touched the timeless, vast landscape of the Samland peninsula, an area of shifting dunes and desolate beaches at the eastern reach of Prussia. Pechstein, who knew this area well from his repeated stays in nearby Nidden, captured the essence of Lautensack's verse in twenty-one lithographs of bathers, frolicking horses, storm-tossed boats, and rustic Baltic architecture. Pechstein populated his raw northern landscapes with figures influenced by African tribal sculpture and Oceanic art, which were key sources in the Expressionist quest for authenticity and rejuvenation. PUBLISHING HISTORYPechstein executed these prints in 1917 during an enormously productive period following his release from the army, when he completed approximately 160 paintings, including many influenced by his trip in 1914 to the Palau Islands in the South Pacific. Gurlitt had funded the trip, and Pechstein consequently owed him prints and portfolios. Die Samländische Ode partly satisfied this obligation."

Der Bildermann featured original lithographs that addressed a range of subjects, not just the war, as an answer to the growing call for beauty as the conflict dragged on. Leo Kestenberg, a pianist and pacifist, ran the journal while Cassirer served in the army. The artist Max Slevogt suggested the periodical's title, which means ""the picture man,"" and designed the vignette on the masthead, which shows a man peddling broadsheets to eager soldiers and civilians of all ages and stations. Der Bildermann balanced a preponderance of allegorical animal scenes by August Gaul with edgier Expressionist works by former Brücke artists—Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Erich Heckel, and Otto Mueller—and monumental images of Death by Ernst Barlach. Oskar Kokoschka, who had been severely injured on the Eastern Front, contributed six prints on the Passion of Christ, focusing on the human capacity to inflict suffering. The publication also featured socially critical print series by Slevogt and Ottomar Starke. Dwindling subscriptions, coupled with increasing difficulties with censors and the bureaucracy, led Cassirer to cease publication of Der Bildermann after only eighteen issues."

In the woodcuts Kandinsky veiled his subject matter, creating increasingly indecipherable images (though the horse and rider, his symbol for overcoming objective representation, runs through as a leitmotif). This process proved crucial for the development of abstraction in his art. Kandinsky said his choice of media sprang from an ""inner necessity"" for expression: the woodcuts were not merely illustrative, nor were the poems purely verbal descriptions. Kandinsky sought a synthesis of the arts, in which meaning was created through the interaction of, and space between, text and image, sound and meaning, mark and blank space. The experimental typography shows his interest in the physical aspects of the book.PUBLISHING HISTORYKlänge is one of three major publications by Kandinsky that appeared shortly before World War I, alongside Über die Geistige in der Kunst (Concerning the Spiritual in Art) and the Blaue Reiter almanac, which he edited with one of the group's cofounders, Franz Marc. Fearing poor sales, Munich-based Reinhard Piper only reluctantly published Klänge, and Kandinsky had to guarantee the production costs. More than two years after its release, Klänge had sold fewer than 120 copies. The planned Russian version never materialized. The publication was nevertheless influential on other avant-garde artists, and Futurists in Russia and Dadaists in Zurich recited and published some of the poems."

He created more than two thousand printed images, working primarily in intaglio techniques but also, for extended periods, in lithography and linoleum cut. It was usually the influence of a master craftsman in a collaborative workshop that served as the impetus for Picasso's printmaking, as new techniques fueled his imagination. Picasso's early prints reflect his evolving artistic language and his place within the major modern movements. The Frugal Repast, of 1904, evokes a sense of mystery and nobility surrounding poverty, recalling the Symbolist aesthetic of Picasso's Blue and Rose periods. Two years later, a woodcut of his companion, Fernande Olivier, betrays the simplified forms he found in Iberian sculpture and a raw expressionism inspired by tribal art. Picasso's illustrations for Saint Matorel, with text by his friend Max Jacob, incorporate the Cubist idiom with which he is most closely associated. While this abstracted language of forms served him throughout his career, his work remained aligned with figurative imagery. In his great prints of the 1930s, created in collaboration with master printer Roger Lacourière, his allegorical inclinations are revealed, while these works also share Surrealist preoccupations with the unconscious. Well into his later years, Picasso remained open to the potential of a new technique. He discovered lithography in the 1940s, at the workshop of Fernand Mourlot in Paris. One monumental series created there, Woman in an Armchair, exists in thirty experimental variations. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he was stimulated by the possibilities of linoleum cut under the tutelage of Hidalgo Arnéra, a printer whose shop was near his studio in southern France. Innovations continued, as evidenced by the one-block process he devised for color printing, seen in the striking Still Life with Glass under the Lamp."

While a prize-winning commercial artist in the 1950s, he devised a printing process of blotting outline drawings in ink from one surface to another. In a whimsical book of fashionable shoe styles, done at the time he was head of advertising at a shoe company, his blotted drawings were reproduced and then hand-colored by a team of friends. Although Warhol adopted a bland, detached persona, he was an extremely energetic artist and self-promoter who played a significant role in redirecting the course of art. Rather than deriving his work from subjective personal feelings or idealist visions for abstraction, Warhol embraced popular culture and commercial processes. He eventually set up his own print-publishing company called Factory Additions, issuing portfolios of his signature themes. For Marilyn, he created ten highly variable portraits, exploiting the possibilities in screenprinting for shifting colors and off-register effects. By celebrating the seemingly impervious veneer of glamour and fame, but acknowledging its darker inner complexity, these prints reveal Warhol's subtle grasp of American culture. Warhol did not participate in the collaborative printshop system established in America in the 1960s, but his work contributed decisively to what has been characterized as a ""print boom"" at that time. Through the course of his career, he made nearly eight hundred printed images on paper, about half published in traditional editions. He was also a surprisingly experimental printmaker, issuing hundreds of trial proofs and unique variants. The compositions that make up Camouflage, his last portfolio, constitute a playful commentary on abstraction. Through manipulation of scale and color from sheet to sheet, Warhol alters the visual impact of the military fabric used for concealment. In examples on canvas, he also superimposes his face, linking self-portraiture with disguise."

He rejected the Impressionist practice of studying effects of light on the external world and instead looked inward to explore themes of love and jealousy, loneliness and anxiety, and sickness and death. His personal history, with the premature loss of his mother and an older sister, as well as complex and unsatisfactory entanglements with women, provided him with a constant source of artistic motifs. The practices of painting, drawing, and printmaking were intertwined for Munch as he reinvestigated the same themes throughout his career. Printmaking was particularly conducive to this practice since he could save his plates, stones, and woodblocks for reuse time and again. Working with professional printers, or availing himself of a press in his studio, he explored some seven hundred fifty subjects in prints, varying his imagery in nearly thirty thousand impressions. Such experimentation can be seen in red and black examples of The Sick Child I, and in three versions of The Lonely Ones, interpreted in both woodcut and etching. Munch sometimes used the same motif in a painting and a print, and a comparison of the two shows the print to be greatly simplified, achieving a sense of essence. Complex emotions are distilled into universal symbols by removing narrative references. Woodcut, in particular, lent itself to this approach. Munch's practice of cutting his blocks like a jigsaw puzzle in order to ink them in sections also enhanced a sense of isolation and abstraction. And the way in which he allowed the patterns of the wood grain to affect his compositions gave an indication of primordial significance. With this approach, the viewer senses artistic process as well as motif, something that would become an underlying component in much twentieth-century art."

Standing apart from the predominant developments of Pop art and Minimalism, her work anticipated the more process-oriented art of Eva Hesse and Bruce Nauman, who emerged a few years later. Her signature wall-mounted constructions consist of strips of canvas stretched over welded steel armatures in weblike arrangements surrounding a central oval void. In a groundbreaking merger of painting and sculpture, these massive, protruding-and-receding structures refer to cosmology, space travel, and the body. Despite her early success, Bontecou withdrew from the New York art scene in the early 1970s, though she continued to work. Her sculpture became less rough and aggressive as she experimented with vacuum-formed plastics to make flowerlike and fishlike forms. Drawing also became an increasingly important aspect of her artistic practice. From 1971 to 1991 she taught in the art department at Brooklyn College. Bontecou was one of a generation of artists who entered printmaking through the gentle insistence of Tatyana Grosman, founder of Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE). Between 1962 and 1982, she made more than thirty prints-mostly lithographs as well as some etchings, always in black and white and echoing the concerns of her sculpture. With very few exceptions, these were all produced at ULAE. In Second Stone, a constellation of floating voids is rendered in a softly modeled, freehand style that reflects her appreciation for lithography's proximity to drawing. For Seventh Stone, she exploited the rich blacks that are possible in lithography to create a more dramatically defined, iconic form. Although Bontecou deliberately left her sculptures and drawings untitled, keeping all interpretations open to the viewer, she used numerical titles to document her prints."

As the son of migrants, Lawrence had a personal connection to the topic.

Lawrence was influenced by the work of the Mexican muralists and earlier artists such as Goya, but he drew his stylistic inspiration primarily from the Harlem community in which he lived.

In 1987 Baumgartner began experimenting with the medium of woodcut, the oldest printmaking technique and one with a great tradition in her hometown of Leipzig, Germany. Since the 1990s she has worked exclusively with a horizontal line structure in her woodcuts, basing many of her compositions on her own video stills.Transall is Baumgartner's largest woodcut to date—over fourteen feet in length—and, remarkably, it is based on a newspaper photograph only inches in size. The print depicts a lineup of aircrafts waiting to be deployed, their power restrained, for the moment, by their stillness. (The title refers to the Transall C-160, a military transport aircraft developed in the 1960s and used over the decades for cargo, refueling, and surveillance.)To create this print, Baumgartner used a computer to magnify the image and transfer it onto an enormous woodblock for carving. Over a period of ten months, the artist laboriously incised hundreds of horizontal lines, until the complete image was realized and ready for printing. Its horizontal construction is emphasized by the panoramic format of the paper, which in turn underscores the magnitude of the aircrafts’ wingspans. The density of the black-and-white linework produces optical sensations that give the illusion of vibration—an effect that enhances the tension between movement and stasis in the image itself."

Kokoschka remained infatuated with her, even after she rebuffed his marriage proposal and aborted his child. The pianist Leo Kestenberg, a friend of Kokoschka's, first played the cantata for him, but Kokoschka insisted it was the libretto, not Bach's music, that prompted him to make the prints.Bach's cantata presents a dialogue between Fear and Hope. In these prints, Kokoschka casts himself in the role of Hope, while Mahler plays Fear. Guided by Fear, Hope sets down a road that leads to his death (although the cantata itself sounds a positive note of divine salvation). Throughout, Kokoschka cites earlier works and weaves in biographical allusions to his relationship with Mahler. The imagery in Drachen über einer Flamme (Dragons over a flame) recalls his attempts to protect the pregnant Mahler from seeing frightening reptiles, while the final print reprises imagery from the poster for his earlier play Mörderer, Hoffnung der Frauen (Murderer, hope of woman). In the penultimate print, Kokoschka depicts himself standing in a grave, an acknowledgement of guilt for the failed relationship. As he later stated, ""I am in the grave, slain by own my jealousy.""In printmaking, Kokoschka preferred lithography for its directness and the rich range of tonal values that he could wrest from the lithographic crayon. He used the power of light and shadow to evoke emotion in these prints."

Monahan has displayed a consistent allegiance to figuration in his work but has also noted ""how inanimate the figure can be."" ""There are moments when the face really comes alive and the body seems to twist of its own volition, when the figure comes at you,"" he has said, ""but I seem to go out of my way to ruin it, to push the gaze back inward and paralyze the body as if caught in the rigidity of a trance."""

By January 1964 her 1963 works had been published by Fluxus, and she had become an important presence in Fluxus performance in New York. On her return to Japan, Shiomi devised a system of global events called Spatial Poems where artists and friends throughout the world could perform events, sometimes simultaneously, and send reports to her in Japan, which were then published in New York by George Maciunas for Fluxus. The first such piece was word event: “Write a word or words on the enclosed card and place it somewhere.” When all these individual realizations were gathered, the information was printed on small flaglike pieces of paper and placed on pins stuck into a map of the world in the location where the word event took place."

In April of the following year, a new subtitle declared the journal a ""weekly for politics, literature, and art."" Although politics remained the priority, Die Aktion began featuring visual art coverage as well as original prints and illustrations. Artist Max Oppenheimer (MOPP) worked closely with Die Aktion in its early years, portraying in its pages many of the young writers who gave the journal its distinctive voice. Egon Schiele made his first woodcuts at Pfemfert's urging in 1916, for publication in the journal. Other frequent contributors included Ludwig Meidner and, later, Conrad Felixmüller and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. Adamantly opposed to World War I, Pfemfert skirted tightened censorship from August 1914 to October 1918 by treating contemporary events only through artistic and literary allusions. At a time when reading books by foreign authors was considered unpatriotic, he dedicated entire issues of Die Aktion to Russian, French, and Belgian authors and artists. In late 1918, however, Pfemfert resumed vocal political critique, siding with the radical left. His selection of prints, formerly varied, became overtly political. After 1921, he ceased art coverage altogether, decreased the number of issues, and used the publication exclusively as a mouthpiece for his own increasingly partisan views."

The portfolio is divided into five subsets, each of which pictures a single shape of light (square, triangle, rectangle, parallelogram, or column) projected against a wall or corner; in this set, a cube seems to change position and shape from sheet to sheet. Turrell collaborated with a master printer known for his work with aquatint, a technique that allows for the use of tone rather than line; here, a rainbow of grays creates a dramatic sense of light, darkness, and space. The artist considers First Light to be his most important printmaking project; while other works on paper are ""about"" his installation work, he has said, First Light is uniquely ""like"" his work. This set is a substantial complement to Turrell's works in other mediums in the collection, including the permanent site-specific installation Meeting (1986), at MoMA PS1, in Queens—a meditative room with a massive rectangular skylight cut into its ceiling."

Like other large-scale residential projects at the time, the housing was designed for the Serviço de Apoio Ambulatório Local (SAAL), a government organization that addressed the lack of safe and affordable housing in Portugal after the revolution of 1974. Part of a greater planning intervention intended to renovate a densely packed neighborhood in the historical center of the city, the row of twelve houses fills the small site, adapting itself to the locale and offering an alternative for tabula rasa approaches to urban renovation. Poetically blending regional and modern references, the project demonstrates that a scarcity of resources can result in a resonant cultural and political architectural statement."
