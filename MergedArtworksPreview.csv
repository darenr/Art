These photocollages are a departure from the architect’s earlier photomontages. Instead of a composite image composed by cut–and–pasting different photographs, the photographic content is presented in dialogue with an architectural sketch. Rather than an external, urban scene, the nearly dematerialized architecture of the interior stages a view onto the surrounding landscape. The design is limited to spare horizontal lines that indicate the planes of floor and ceiling and slender cruciform columns that span between them. The overscaled and vividly textured landscape imagery was taken from film posters and magazines. It acts both as a visual extension of the architecture and an illusionistic space that distorts and rearranges the linear perspective of the drawing."

Immer und Immer (Again and again) is the second of two works by poet Max Roden that he illustrated, and one of only twenty-two books for which he made lithographs rather than ink drawings, his preferred medium. Roden's poem catalogues the evil that people inflict upon one another. Kubin's fantastic and eerie images capture the spirit of Roden's verse without strictly following the text and without inhabiting any specific time or place. The title page depicts a screaming man behind a barbed-wire fence in a seemingly contemporary scene, while the army marching across the next image, with standards flying and trumpets blaring, appears as if from a faraway time. On another page, disembodied Medusa heads fly over a walled city. The book closes with Kubin's picture of a bleeding heart, impaled on a bayonet.PUBLICATION HISTORYImmer und Immer was one of the last books published by Vienna's Johannes-Presse, which was founded in 1924 by the gallerist Otto Nirenstein, before the firm was ""Aryanized"" when the Nazis annexed Austria in 1938."

Trained in Paris in the 1890s, he was one of the first American painters to assimilate contemporary trends in modern European painting. His use of flat, abstract fields of pure color, decorative patterning, boldly contoured forms, and unusual angles and framing devices is associated with Post-Impressionism. His influences include James McNeill Whistler, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, and the Nabi artists, as well as Japanese prints and French posters. Prendergast confined his interest in printmaking to the monotype technique and, through his consistent use of multiple colors, promoted the idea of the fine-art color print to the general public. He described his process in 1905: ""Paint on copper in oils, wiping parts to be white. When picture suits you, place on it Japanese paper and either press in a press or rub with a spoon till it pleases you."" Prendergast is thought to have created approximately two hundred monotypes between 1891 and 1902, although somewhat fewer are known today. In his overall oeuvre, they stand between his delicate, early watercolors and his rough, late, impasto oils. Requiring rapid execution, the monotype process lends itself to loose, gestural brushwork, as in the two prints shown here. In Orange Market, thought to be based on fruitstands in Venice, light infuses the composition wherever the paper shows through the paint, creating distinct highlights. The umbrella motif, the central horizon line, and the border recall elements in Japanese prints. Comparable effects are visible in The Rehearsal, which demonstrates Prendergast's interest in motifs related to entertainment, including the ballet and the circus."

Klinger meticulously depicts the real and the imaginary with hallucinatory clarity, casting himself as protagonist. At a skating rink in Berlin, Klinger is seen eyeing a beautiful young woman; he swoops down to retrieve her dropped glove. This intimate and potently sexualized object triggers a series of elaborate visions of longing and loss, conveyed through dreamlike distortions of scale and jarring juxtapositions. As desire threatens to engulf Klinger, the fetishized glove takes on a life of its own. It assumes the attributes of Venus, born of sea foam and driving a shell chariot. An outsize version torments him in his sleep, recalling Francisco de Goya's prints. Klinger's grasp on the glove remains elusive, and a fantastic creature finally spirits the object away. PUBLISHING HISTORYIn 1878 Klinger, just twenty-one years old, debuted at the Berlin Royal Academy of the Arts' annual exhibition with a cycle of drawings that, encouraged by art dealer and engraver Hermann Sagert, he etched two years later and published in 1881 as Ein Handschuh. This is one of thirteen print portfolios he created during his long and distinguished career. For Klinger, prints were an ideal medium for examining contemporary social issues and scenes from his own imagination—for exploring what he called the ""dark side of life."" More specifically, he found black-and-white prints, with their lack of color and thus their distance from everyday life, to be well suited to his subjective view of the world. Klinger's prints were an enormous influence on later artists and printmakers, including Käthe Kollwitz, German Expressionists, and Surrealists."

With curvilinear lines and biomorphic shapes, he sought to meld the realm of the unconscious to essential life forms, veering toward abstraction but always maintaining links to humanity, nature, and the cosmos. Miró's relationship to printmaking was tentative at first, with benefit prints such as Daphnis and Chloé for the periodical Minotaure, and Woman and Dog in Front of the Moon for an association of artists in Barcelona. It was when he was introduced to the painter Louis Marcoussis, who maintained a printshop in his studio, that he took up printmaking in earnest, and his natural inclinations toward new tools and materials blossomed. His methodical working process also suited these efforts, and prints of the Black and Red Series, created there, demonstrate his systematic use of more than one copperplate and his experiments with color inking. In the example here a symbolic family group responds in terror to a monstrous head, referring to Miró's anguish over the Spanish Civil War and the fear provoked by Generalissimo Francisco Franco at that time. Miró continued his exploration of intaglio techniques at Stanley William Hayter's Atelier 17 workshop in New York in the 1940s, when he was there on an extended visit. Soon after, he began his active involvement with lithography through the instigation of his Parisian dealer Aimé Maeght, making numerous individual prints, as well as posters, invitations, catalogue covers, and even holiday cards. He also turned increasingly to illustrated books, a format he had attempted earlier in his career, and created twentieth-century landmarks like À Toute épreuve. Further discoveries followed, with Miró making more than two thousand prints in all, always expanding his creativity through his love of technique and process."

His gridded compositions are, he said, a ""byproduct of the influence of Mondrian . . . except that the result visually is not the same."" One striking difference is the tondo format of this canvas, common in the artists work; he made his first tondo painting by stretching a canvas across the rim of a wagon wheel. A longtime instructor of art, Bolotowsky spent 1946–48 at Black Mountain College in North Carolina, where he taught painting and drawing and served as acting director during Josef Albers's sabbatical."

The Belgian Surrealist writer Louis Scutenaire described Magritte's objects as totems, and the spare arrangement here points toward the significance of a ritual meal. The perspective of this still life tilts dramatically toward the surface of the picture plane, as if to confront or perhaps invite the viewer to join the table.

This fracturing of solid volumes offered an alternative to the traditional illusionistic and perspectival approach to depicting three–dimensional space on a two–dimensional  surface and suggests the direction Picasso's process would take in the development of Cubism.

Schapire and Niemeyer both had close ties to Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, a former member of the Brücke. Schmidt-Rottluff was a decisive influence on the journal's style and was responsible for the cover, a woodcut that was printed in a different color for each issue. Die Kündung also featured original prints by Franz Radziwill, Siegfried Schott, Lasar Segall, and others, as well as woodcut illustrations of poems in which rough, crude lettering reflected the ecstatic tone and primitivist language of the texts. In addition, the publication included short stories and critical essays on art and literature, printed in a wide variety of typefaces and with ornamental initials by Schmidt-Rottluff.

Splicing together pictures of Vietnamese citizens maimed in the war, published in Life magazine, with images of the homes of affluent Americans culled from the pages of House Beautiful, Rosler made literal the description of the conflict as the ""living-room war,"" so called in the USA because the news of ongoing carnage in Southeast Asia filtered into tranquil American homes through television reports. By urging viewers to reconsider the ""here"" and ""there"" of the world picture, these activist photomontages reveal the extent to which a collective experience of war is shaped by media images."

Vander Kooij’s designs can be modified as they are made—flaws can be tweaked or corrected from prototype to prototype, making each piece unique, and this can be done quickly and at little cost. For example, fifty-four models of Endless Flow were made during the prototyping process, tweaked progressively until the chair sat comfortably."
