While trying to encapsulate this period, across all geographic regions is incredibly complex, a few historical events, art world changes, and broader tendencies in contemporary art can be mentioned. Regarding historical events, a few continue to resonate with artists, primarily the attacks on New York and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001 and the subsequent U.S.-led invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, artists have grappled with the global financial crisis which emerged in 2008. This period also witnessed an extraordinary rate of growth in the art market: for instance, the total revenue of contemporary art works reached $1.26 billion in 2011, more than 14 times higher than the amount it fetched in 2001. This has been accompanied by a huge swell in the number of international art fairs and biennials, and a general globalization of the art world, with robust markets and institutions emerging in countries such as China, India, and Brazil. In terms of art and architecture, a few major trends should be mentioned: the appearance of large-scale works by ambitious studios (such as those of [Olafur Eliasson](/artist/olafur-eliasson) and [Jeff Koons](/artist/jeff-koons)); the influence of new media art and the Internet (evidenced by the work of [Ryan Trecartin](/artist/ryan-trecartin)), as well as the proliferation of museum culture and destination museums, such as [Frank Gehry](/artist/frank-gehry)'s Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.\n",

This development is thought to have been inspired by a loss of faith in ordered Western civilization in the wake of World War I, as well by the development of relativist principles in fields ranging from quantum physics to psychology to Eastern philosophy. [Jean Arp](/artist/jean-arp) composed collages by dropping shapes at random while [Marcel Duchamp](/artist/marcel-duchamp) recorded the patterns formed by dropped strings; both diminished the status of the artist's conscious decisions in creating an artwork. Explorations of chance and the potential of the unconscious were central to both [Surrealism](/gene/surrealism) as well artists of later generations, like the [Abstract Expressionists](/gene/abstract-expressionism). [Ellsworth Kelly](/artist/ellsworth-kelly), for one, is well-known for choosing the colors for his grid paintings by rolling dice. The 1960s [Happenings](/gene/happenings) associated with [Fluxus](/gene/fluxus) and others introduced a new element of chance into art-making, with [John Cage](/artist/john-cage) famously using flipped coins as a means of composing musical scores.",

Perhaps most tellingly, this 20-year period is bookended by a “day which would live in infamy”—the United States’ entry into World War II in 1941—and the Explorer 6 satellite’s transmission of the first picture of Earth from orbit in 1959. The global conflict of WWII was marked by unprecedented crimes against humanity and left behind unprecedented destruction when it ended in 1945. In the fall-out, the world was divided into adversarial spheres of influence (the Cold War), while towards the end of the 1950s former European colonies fought for independence.

Afterward you can remove all traces of reality.” —[Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso)_\n\nOf all the art battles and debates of the 20th century, none has been as divisive as that between abstract and figurative art.

Bright colors—saturated hues with a high level of lightness—evoke strong associations and meanings throughout the world, denote deities, emotions, or ideas. However, with the rise of Neo-Classicism in the West, which embraced the dictates of purity and “good taste,” bright colors were deemed too garish and fell out of fashion. With the advent of abstraction in the 20th century, however, artists once again widely explored bright colors, oftentimes as a means of expressing psychological experiences. Before the advent of synthetic pigments in the early 18th century, bright colors were difficult and costly to achieve, but since the mass-manufacturing of bold pigments and dyes beginning in the mid-20th century, bright colors are widely available.\n",

With the emergence of [Cubism](/gene/cubism) and the movements and artists that followed it, as well as the writings of American critics like Clement Greenberg, the progression towards a non-objective abstraction (wherein no objects could be recognized) became the dominant story of modern art; in turn, figuration became discredited, labeled as retrograde and aligned with enemy politics (read: Communism and [Socialist Realism](/gene/socialist-realism), or the National Socialist dictate of figurative art). Yet in reality, for many artists throughout the 20th century and into the present day, the dividing line between abstraction and figuration was much more porous, leading these artists to create paintings and works on paper somewhere in between the two. In the immediate post-war period in Europe, [Francis Bacon](/artist/francis-bacon) walked what he called the “tightrope between abstraction and figuration” to ask existential questions about the image of man, while contemporary artists like [Cecily Brown](/artist/cecily-brown) continue the tradition of [Willem de Kooning](/artist/willem-de-kooning), pushing their figures even closer to complete abstraction.",

Greek mythology, concerned largely with the lives of gods and heroic humans, has origins in oral tradition but was recorded by poets such as Homer, Sophocles, and Euripides. Roman mythology, which borrowed heavily from Greek predecessors, often dealt with myths of origin, social institutions, and human destiny; key poets included Virgil and Ovid and central stories include those of the She-Wolf of the Capitoline and the Rape of the Sabine Women. Mythological narratives were represented widely in Greek and Roman art, particularly in pottery, sculpture, and mosaics. The allegorical power of the widely known stories remained long after the decline of associated pagan religions, and overlaps between pagan and Christian imagery are visible in the tombs of the earliest Christians. While classical imagery was largely dormant in the Medieval period, it returned in full force in iconic Renaissance paintings and sculptures by the likes of [Botticelli](/artist/alessandro-filipepi-called-sandro-botticelli), [Titian](/artist/tiziano-vecellio-called-titian), and [Raphael](/artist/raphael-raffaello-sanzio-da-urbino) in Italy and [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer) in Germany, all of whom sought to reconcile Christian piety with Classical thought. Subsequent painters who dealt regularly with classical themes included [Peter Paul Rubens](/artist/peter-paul-rubens) and [Nicolas Poussin](/artist/nicolas-poussin), and in 17th- and 18th-century academic painting, the use of classical stories was an esteemed technique. In the last two centuries, artists have treated classical myths with a great deal of flexibility, examples including [Gustave Moreau](/artist/gustave-moreau)'s Symbolist depictions, [Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso)'s works concerning the Spanish Civil War, and [Romare Bearden](/artist/romare-bearden)'s retelling of classical stories with black subjects.\n",

However, this is a relatively recent development; although early experiments with various photosensitive chemicals began in the 1840s shortly after photography’s birth, it was not until the 1890s that such chemical processes were successfully applied to the production of color film, and only a few early experimenters—mostly amateur scientists or intrepid travelers—used the medium to capture nature, cultural sites, or the occasional sitter. And it wasn't until Kodak’s breakthroughs in the mass manufacture of color film in 1935 that color photography became widely accessible, and commercial photographers swiftly adopted the new “Kodachrome” brand. In art, the delay took even longer; the watershed moment was [William Eggleston](/artist/william-eggleston)’s exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art in 1976—the first major museum exhibition of color photography. The invention of digital photography and advances in printing technologies have further expanded its scope—from digital manipulation to the monumental printing techniques often associated with the [Dusseldorf School of Photography](/gene/dusseldorf-school-of-photography)—and contemporary artists continue to explore new paths for color photography, such as through the use of [photograms](/gene/photogram), diaristic works, or even approaching the photographic print as a sculptural material.\n",

Bright colors—saturated hues with a high level of lightness—evoke strong associations and meanings throughout the world, denote deities, emotions, or ideas. However, with the rise of Neo-Classicism in the West, which embraced the dictates of purity and “good taste,” bright colors were deemed too garish and fell out of fashion. With the advent of abstraction in the 20th century, however, artists once again widely explored bright colors, oftentimes as a means of expressing psychological experiences. Before the advent of synthetic pigments in the early 18th century, bright colors were difficult and costly to achieve, but since the mass-manufacturing of bold pigments and dyes beginning in the mid-20th century, bright colors are widely available.\n",

While trying to encapsulate this period, across all geographic regions is incredibly complex, a few historical events, art world changes, and broader tendencies in contemporary art can be mentioned. Regarding historical events, a few continue to resonate with artists, primarily the attacks on New York and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001 and the subsequent U.S.-led invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, artists have grappled with the global financial crisis which emerged in 2008. This period also witnessed an extraordinary rate of growth in the art market: for instance, the total revenue of contemporary art works reached $1.26 billion in 2011, more than 14 times higher than the amount it fetched in 2001. This has been accompanied by a huge swell in the number of international art fairs and biennials, and a general globalization of the art world, with robust markets and institutions emerging in countries such as China, India, and Brazil. In terms of art and architecture, a few major trends should be mentioned: the appearance of large-scale works by ambitious studios (such as those of [Olafur Eliasson](/artist/olafur-eliasson) and [Jeff Koons](/artist/jeff-koons)); the influence of new media art and the Internet (evidenced by the work of [Ryan Trecartin](/artist/ryan-trecartin)), as well as the proliferation of museum culture and destination museums, such as [Frank Gehry](/artist/frank-gehry)'s Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.\n",

Gesture, grimace, clothing, decor even—all must combine to realize a character.” —Charles Baudelaire_\n\nIndividual portraiture—the likeness of a single person—has long been one of the most popular forms of art. Whether as an attempt at objective or documentary truth or to express the power and prestige (or idea) of a person, individual portraits examine what it means to be human and an individual. Classical Greek portraiture was concerned with formal, ideal beauty rather than documentary truth. The Renaissance and a renewed interest in humanism established the great portrait tradition, which would pervade Europe for the next three hundred years, dominated by [Raphael](/artist/raphael) in Rome and [Titian](/artist/titian) in Venice. Individual portraits were also often commissioned by monarchs to reinforce and display royal might: [Hans Holbein](/artist/hans-holbein-the-younger)’s famous portrait of Henry VIII is a quintessential example of the portrait’s power to flatter and play to a sitter’s vanity. Likewise, portraits played a vital role in displaying and mirroring the material wealth of the growing merchant class in the Dutch golden age, as in the work of [Frans Hals](/artist/frans-hals) or [Rembrandt van Rijn](/artist/rembrandt-van-rijn). The invention of photography in the mid 1800s caused the portrait tradition to rapidly change; the newfound ability to capture an individual “as they were” meant that the painted portrait could no longer be taken for granted.

Though they produce visually similar results, etching involves incising a wax-coated metal plate with a sharp tool and placing the plate into an acid bath. The acid corrodes the exposed lines, leaving the waxy ground unaffected; the plate is then inked and printed, forcing the paper into the incised lines. Considered one of the great masters of the technique, [Rembrandt van Rijn](/artist/rembrandt-van-rijn) harnessed the medium’s similarity to drawing with a pencil or pen. Engraving, the oldest intaglio technique and the most common method seen in Old Master prints, involves directly incising a metal matrix and then printing. Engraving arguably reached its pinnacle with [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer), who mastered the technique's precise and tapered lines to achieve great tonality as seen in [this print](artwork/albrecht-durer-st-anthony).",

With the advent of abstraction in the 20th century, however, artists once again widely explored bright colors, oftentimes as a means of expressing psychological experiences. Before the advent of synthetic pigments in the early 18th century, bright colors were difficult and costly to achieve, but since the mass-manufacturing of bold pigments and dyes beginning in the mid-20th century, bright colors are widely available.\n",

With the emergence of [Cubism](/gene/cubism) and the movements and artists that followed it, as well as the writings of American critics like Clement Greenberg, the progression towards a non-objective abstraction (wherein no objects could be recognized) became the dominant story of modern art; in turn, figuration became discredited, labeled as retrograde and aligned with enemy politics (read: Communism and [Socialist Realism](/gene/socialist-realism), or the National Socialist dictate of figurative art). Yet in reality, for many artists throughout the 20th century and into the present day, the dividing line between abstraction and figuration was much more porous, leading these artists to create paintings and works on paper somewhere in between the two. In the immediate post-war period in Europe, [Francis Bacon](/artist/francis-bacon) walked what he called the “tightrope between abstraction and figuration” to ask existential questions about the image of man, while contemporary artists like [Cecily Brown](/artist/cecily-brown) continue the tradition of [Willem de Kooning](/artist/willem-de-kooning), pushing their figures even closer to complete abstraction.",

Bright colors—saturated hues with a high level of lightness—evoke strong associations and meanings throughout the world, denote deities, emotions, or ideas. However, with the rise of Neo-Classicism in the West, which embraced the dictates of purity and “good taste,” bright colors were deemed too garish and fell out of fashion. With the advent of abstraction in the 20th century, however, artists once again widely explored bright colors, oftentimes as a means of expressing psychological experiences. Before the advent of synthetic pigments in the early 18th century, bright colors were difficult and costly to achieve, but since the mass-manufacturing of bold pigments and dyes beginning in the mid-20th century, bright colors are widely available.\n",

With the emergence of [Cubism](/gene/cubism) and the movements and artists that followed it, as well as the writings of American critics like Clement Greenberg, the progression towards a non-objective abstraction (wherein no objects could be recognized) became the dominant story of modern art; in turn, figuration became discredited, labeled as retrograde and aligned with enemy politics (read: Communism and [Socialist Realism](/gene/socialist-realism), or the National Socialist dictate of figurative art). Yet in reality, for many artists throughout the 20th century and into the present day, the dividing line between abstraction and figuration was much more porous, leading these artists to create paintings and works on paper somewhere in between the two. In the immediate post-war period in Europe, [Francis Bacon](/artist/francis-bacon) walked what he called the “tightrope between abstraction and figuration” to ask existential questions about the image of man, while contemporary artists like [Cecily Brown](/artist/cecily-brown) continue the tradition of [Willem de Kooning](/artist/willem-de-kooning), pushing their figures even closer to complete abstraction.",

[Jacob A. Riis](https://artsy.net/artist/jacob-a-riis) often depicted children in his photographs of life in New York City tenements, in order to stir public empathy around their living conditions. In contemporary art, portraits of children figure in [Taryn Simon](https://artsy.net/artist/taryn-simon)'s broad genealogical projects and [Sally Mann](https://artsy.net/artist/sally-mann)'s controversial photographs of her own offspring, while artists such as [Mike Kelley](https://artsy.net/artist/mike-kelley) and [Paul McCarthy](https://artsy.net/artist/paul-mccarthy) have probed the darker elements of childhood.\n",

Related to caricature, parody is a narrative or literary device—as opposed to a type of visual depiction—that imitates an original work or set of conventions while distorting it to comic, satirical or critical effect. In Western art, parody can be traced back to ancient Greek drama, while caricature is generally considered to have emerged out of 16th-century carnivalesque culture and grotesque disfigurations of the human figure. Over the course of the late-18th and 19th centuries in Europe and the United States, caricatures circulated in the press and pamphlets often delivered pointed political or social commentary. [William Hogarth](/artist/william-hogarth), considered the father of English caricature, made light of English social mores in his paintings and prints of the late 1700s, and by the 1830s in France a publication devoted entirely to the form, _La Caricature_, provided a forum for [Honoré Daumier](/artist/honore-daumier)’s political drawings.

And it wasn't until Kodak’s breakthroughs in the mass manufacture of color film in 1935 that color photography became widely accessible, and commercial photographers swiftly adopted the new “Kodachrome” brand. In art, the delay took even longer; the watershed moment was [William Eggleston](/artist/william-eggleston)’s exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art in 1976—the first major museum exhibition of color photography.

Arguably the first abstract art movement, Cubism would prove foundational to countless branches of abstract art, including [Futurism](/gene/futurism) in Italy, the non-objective abstraction of [Wassily Kandinsky](/artist/wassily-kandinsky), [Kasimir Malevich](/artist/kasimir-malevich), and [Piet Mondrian](/artist/piet-mondrian), and the [Purism](/gene/purism) of [Le Corbusier](/artist/le-corbusier) and [Amédée Ozenfant](/artist/amedee-ozenfant).

Historically, until the broad use of color photography, documentary photography was black and white and captured events with precise focus, limited distortions, and minimal darkroom editing, with the understanding that to manipulate was to distort the truth. It also has characteristically carried a social imperative: to expose what life is like truthfully—in cities, in poverty, in disasters—and to encourage societal progress. Accordingly, some of the best-known historical documentary photographers were also heavily involved in activist causes against poverty and child labor, such as [Jacob Riis](/artist/jacob-august-riis) and [Lewis Hine](/artist/lewis-wickes-hine).

With the emergence of [Cubism](/gene/cubism) and the movements and artists that followed it, as well as the writings of American critics like Clement Greenberg, the progression towards a non-objective abstraction (wherein no objects could be recognized) became the dominant story of modern art; in turn, figuration became discredited, labeled as retrograde and aligned with enemy politics (read: Communism and [Socialist Realism](/gene/socialist-realism), or the National Socialist dictate of figurative art). Yet in reality, for many artists throughout the 20th century and into the present day, the dividing line between abstraction and figuration was much more porous, leading these artists to create paintings and works on paper somewhere in between the two. In the immediate post-war period in Europe, [Francis Bacon](/artist/francis-bacon) walked what he called the “tightrope between abstraction and figuration” to ask existential questions about the image of man, while contemporary artists like [Cecily Brown](/artist/cecily-brown) continue the tradition of [Willem de Kooning](/artist/willem-de-kooning), pushing their figures even closer to complete abstraction.",

However, this is a relatively recent development; although early experiments with various photosensitive chemicals began in the 1840s shortly after photography’s birth, it was not until the 1890s that such chemical processes were successfully applied to the production of color film, and only a few early experimenters—mostly amateur scientists or intrepid travelers—used the medium to capture nature, cultural sites, or the occasional sitter. And it wasn't until Kodak’s breakthroughs in the mass manufacture of color film in 1935 that color photography became widely accessible, and commercial photographers swiftly adopted the new “Kodachrome” brand. In art, the delay took even longer; the watershed moment was [William Eggleston](/artist/william-eggleston)’s exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art in 1976—the first major museum exhibition of color photography. The invention of digital photography and advances in printing technologies have further expanded its scope—from digital manipulation to the monumental printing techniques often associated with the [Dusseldorf School of Photography](/gene/dusseldorf-school-of-photography)—and contemporary artists continue to explore new paths for color photography, such as through the use of [photograms](/gene/photogram), diaristic works, or even approaching the photographic print as a sculptural material.\n",

Bright colors—saturated hues with a high level of lightness—evoke strong associations and meanings throughout the world, denote deities, emotions, or ideas. However, with the rise of Neo-Classicism in the West, which embraced the dictates of purity and “good taste,” bright colors were deemed too garish and fell out of fashion. With the advent of abstraction in the 20th century, however, artists once again widely explored bright colors, oftentimes as a means of expressing psychological experiences.

This facility makes it the most versatile and explicit means of communication yet devised for quick mass appreciation.\" —Walt Disney_\n\nWhile basic animation devices (such as flip books) date to as early as A.D. 180, what is commonly understood as animation—film in which drawn subjects seem to move on their own—arose at the beginning of the 20th century in the U.S. and Europe. James Stuart Blackton's _Humorous Phases of Funny Faces_ is arguably considered the first animation; Emil Cohl's _Fantasmagorie_ is considered the first animated film. From its rough beginnings in the 20th century, animation has become one of the most popular forms of world entertainment. Aside from the imagery dispersed worldwide by Disney, a multitude of highly influential other genres have arisen in the last 50 years, whose methods and characters have had a significant effect on artists, such as Japanese anime or the recent rise of animated GIFs.",

Many of these artists also drew inspiration from [Mexican muralism](/gene/mexican-muralism) and [pre-Columbian art](/gene/pre-columbian-art).

As stated by the exhibition’s advisory committee: “Chicano art is the modern, ongoing expression of the long-term cultural, economic, and political struggle of the Mexicano people within the United States. It is an affirmation of the complex identity and vitality of the Chicano People. Chicano art arises from and is shaped by our experiences in the Americas.” Central to the movement is the concept of “rasquachismo” (from _rasquache_, Spanish for poor), which refers to an attitude of resourcefulness and “making do,” which may refer to using [commonly available materials](/gene/use-of-common-materials), drawing on communities, or even sampling from other art movements or postmodern theories.",

However, this is a relatively recent development; although early experiments with various photosensitive chemicals began in the 1840s shortly after photography’s birth, it was not until the 1890s that such chemical processes were successfully applied to the production of color film, and only a few early experimenters—mostly amateur scientists or intrepid travelers—used the medium to capture nature, cultural sites, or the occasional sitter. And it wasn't until Kodak’s breakthroughs in the mass manufacture of color film in 1935 that color photography became widely accessible, and commercial photographers swiftly adopted the new “Kodachrome” brand. In art, the delay took even longer; the watershed moment was [William Eggleston](/artist/william-eggleston)’s exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art in 1976—the first major museum exhibition of color photography. The invention of digital photography and advances in printing technologies have further expanded its scope—from digital manipulation to the monumental printing techniques often associated with the [Dusseldorf School of Photography](/gene/dusseldorf-school-of-photography)—and contemporary artists continue to explore new paths for color photography, such as through the use of [photograms](/gene/photogram), diaristic works, or even approaching the photographic print as a sculptural material.\n",

This proved to be an effective medium for widely distributing political caricatures as well as scenes of everyday life. In the 20th century, artists turned to addressing the form and content of messages distributed by mass media, particularly television. For instance, [Nam June Paik](/artist/nam-june-paik-and-jud-yalkut)'s early experimentations in video art frequently involved the appropriation and distortion of television footage, while [Andy Warhol](/artist/andy-warhol)'s repetitive silkscreens of such images blurred the lines between critical and celebratory. Brazilian artist [Hélio Oiticica](/artist/helio-oiticica) included television screens in his “Tropicalia” installations, joining an international group of artists in the 1960s interested in subverting mass media strategies for different ends. Since then, artists have made use of such images in a number of ways, among them [Richard Prince](/artist/richard-prince)'s and [Gilbert & George](/artist/gilbert-and-george)'s appropriations.",

Bright colors—saturated hues with a high level of lightness—evoke strong associations and meanings throughout the world, denote deities, emotions, or ideas. However, with the rise of Neo-Classicism in the West, which embraced the dictates of purity and “good taste,” bright colors were deemed too garish and fell out of fashion. With the advent of abstraction in the 20th century, however, artists once again widely explored bright colors, oftentimes as a means of expressing psychological experiences. Before the advent of synthetic pigments in the early 18th century, bright colors were difficult and costly to achieve, but since the mass-manufacturing of bold pigments and dyes beginning in the mid-20th century, bright colors are widely available.\n",

Related to caricature, parody is a narrative or literary device—as opposed to a type of visual depiction—that imitates an original work or set of conventions while distorting it to comic, satirical or critical effect. In Western art, parody can be traced back to ancient Greek drama, while caricature is generally considered to have emerged out of 16th-century carnivalesque culture and grotesque disfigurations of the human figure. Over the course of the late-18th and 19th centuries in Europe and the United States, caricatures circulated in the press and pamphlets often delivered pointed political or social commentary. [William Hogarth](/artist/william-hogarth), considered the father of English caricature, made light of English social mores in his paintings and prints of the late 1700s, and by the 1830s in France a publication devoted entirely to the form, _La Caricature_, provided a forum for [Honoré Daumier](/artist/honore-daumier)’s political drawings.

The two poles are, essentially, stylistic: [Photorealism](/gene/photorealistic) (like that of [Chuck Close](/artist/chuck-close)) at one extreme, and nearly abstract and unrecognizable figuration (like [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso)'s Analytic [Cubism](/gene/cubism)) at the other. While for much of the 20th century figurative painting was largely ignored by the Western avant-garde, the course changed with the 1980s emergence of figurative painters like [Anselm Kiefer](/artist/anselm-kiefer), [Jean-Michel Basquiat](/artist/jean-michel-basquiat), and [David Salle](/artist/david-salle); this renewed interest in turn shed light on figurative painters who had long been working in the same vein, from [Lucian Freud](/artist/lucian-freud) and [Alice Neel](/artist/alice-neel) to [Alex Katz](/artist/alex-katz), [Gerhard Richter](/artist/gerhard-richter), and countless others.

With the emergence of [Cubism](/gene/cubism) and the movements and artists that followed it, as well as the writings of American critics like Clement Greenberg, the progression towards a non-objective abstraction (wherein no objects could be recognized) became the dominant story of modern art; in turn, figuration became discredited, labeled as retrograde and aligned with enemy politics (read: Communism and [Socialist Realism](/gene/socialist-realism), or the National Socialist dictate of figurative art). Yet in reality, for many artists throughout the 20th century and into the present day, the dividing line between abstraction and figuration was much more porous, leading these artists to create paintings and works on paper somewhere in between the two. In the immediate post-war period in Europe, [Francis Bacon](/artist/francis-bacon) walked what he called the “tightrope between abstraction and figuration” to ask existential questions about the image of man, while contemporary artists like [Cecily Brown](/artist/cecily-brown) continue the tradition of [Willem de Kooning](/artist/willem-de-kooning), pushing their figures even closer to complete abstraction.",

The development of the modern comic strip of the 18th and 19th centuries is indebted to artists, particularly the social- and political-themed print series of renowned artists such as [William Hogarth](/artist/william-hogarth), [Francisco de Goya](/artist/francisco-jose-de-goya-y-lucientes-1), and [Honoré Daumier](/artist/honore-daumier). Comic strips began heavily influencing artists in the 1960s. Pop artists like [Andy Warhol](/artist/andy-warhol) and Roy Lichtenstein used the style to showcase their interest in \"low\" or popular imagery, consumerism, and mechanical reproduction techniques, rejecting the artist's hand. Since the 1960s, [graffiti and street art](/gene/graffiti-slash-street-art) have continued to draw upon both the wit and mass appeal of cartoons, as in the politically charged work of [Keith Haring](/artist/keith-haring).",
