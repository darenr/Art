    "artist_description": "Aaron Young's artworks rely on the aftereffects of dynamic, energetic, and sometimes even dangerous performances. He hires participants stereotyped as marginalized rebels, such as skateboarders and motorcycle riders, to perform various stunts in exhibition spaces on specially prepared platforms such as the performance Arc Light for the exhibition, for what you are about to receive. Like Steven Parrino, Young uses destructive actions as generative force; the traces of his ephemeral acts are recorded as videos, drawings, sculptures, and photographs to constitute artistic artifacts.

The action is simple: I kick a video camera through a site that is embedded with sociological elements, which I try to question through my practice. I chose Red Square as the site to work in Moscow. The square is interesting as a kind of high/low, new/old dichotomy of a new capitalist regime, with the most expensive World-brands of fashion, design and architecture creeping in like a drug that everyone is forced to take but hasn't been tested long enough to know the effects. All of this is in direct opposition to an almost outdated value system represented by Lenin's tomb across the road. After summing up this pyramid of power and history, having it laid out in a square where there can be a final point… me as an American here performing a very minimal, radical action of kicking a camera over time within those parameters. The camera breaks down within three to four minutes, creating a time-based situation: the image that is being recorded disappears kick after kick and visually erases all the embedded history, the politics… the finished work lends itself to a social/cultural amnesia that I find exists in this place.\"",

The title is a reference to a building Frank Lloyd Wright designed for Tokyo, which was completed in 1923. In its heyday, which lasted until after World War II, the hotel was reserved for elite personnel, many of them foreigners. With the passage of time it came to be seen as outdated and dingy, and it was demolished in the 1960s. Cruzvillegas's work ironically and humorously symbolizes the hotel imposing presence. He presents us with the ultimate symbol of democracy a phonebook pierced with arrows. The sculpture is a symbol of solidarity imperiled by imperialism. ",

    "artist_description": "Born and raised in Chicago, Adrian Wong was originally trained in research psychology at Stanford University. He began making and exhibiting work in San Francisco while concurrently conducting experiments on young children for his Masters degree. Wong's training in psychology made him aware of the limitation of research methodology, which ultimately redirected his interest to other aspects of his research subjects: \"I'm not looking for universal facts; I'm looking for more subjective and affective entry points.\" He has been based in Hong Kong, S.A.R. since 2005, where he is the co-founder and director of Embassy Projects, an arts consultancy and independent production studio. His installations, videos, and sculptures draw from varied subjects and explore the intricacies of his relationship to his environment. These relationships, often relying on collaboration with subjects, take on modes of the experiential, historical, and cultural, at times, filtered by fantastical or fictionalized narratives. ",

Intrigued by the accidental preservation of historical building material by renovations and rebuilding, Wong began paying attention to the experience conveyed by layered forms accreted to affect the visual historicity of a space. The geometric forms in the piece are welded together as a composite replica of a metal grate from a children's playground next to Wong's studio, a security grate door from his apartment complex, and the latticework that holds an air conditioner from an electronic store, and a front grate from an elementary school on his bus route. This melding is a recognition of objects that normally recedes into the background of one's experience in the city by recognizing their role as partitions that break visual fields into parallax spaces or planes of movement.

The images capture scenes from an urban development, La Vega, built to modernize and connect favelas in Venezuela. Using money from the newly nationalized oil industry in the 1970s, La Vega and Los Manalos became examples of a utopian promise that the money accruing from the oil industry would be distributed to better the lives of the people. Using images of these developments and a \"faulty scanner\" to manipulate these images, resulting in the darkened lines and visual breaks that strike through the photograph, Balteo Yazbeck points to the fracturing and unreality of this promise.

In the early 1990s he was known as a member of the art collective Los Carpinteros, which he left in 2003 in order to pursue his career as a solo artist. Since then, his works have often explored the growing prominence of surveillance systems in contemporary society and the fragility, loss of privacy, and disempowerment that result from this obsession with control. Recently, Arrechea's interest in the limits of the artwork itself has led to his creation of interdisciplinary works in public spaces.",

The projection on the left hand presents Arrechea wielding a machete, while on the right he holds a baseball bat. Together, the artist appears to be unwittingly attacking himself, a poignant comment on blind fear and the failure to recognize the similarity in the \"otherness.\"",

California Stories: Attempt to correlate social class with elevation above main harbor channel (San Pedro, July 1975) (1973 2011) is a series of coupled gelatin silver prints that show the artist using his hand to measure the elevation of various pieces of real estate, ranging from a manicured mansion to a ramshackle beach house. A direct equation becomes evident between the social strata these homes represent and the height at which the artist holds his hand. By assigning a simple, visual value to an otherwise murky undercurrent, Sekula surfaces issues of class and subjects them to unconventional inquiry.",

    "artist_description": "Like many of his peers in the 1960s, Allen Ruppersberg recognized art as existing not in the isolated realm of aesthetics, but as a practice with a clear political and critical potential, one inextricably immersed in an economic system. Ruppersberg took as source material diverse items stemming from a distinct American form of popular culture of the mid-twentieth century. However, it was perhaps his particular use of everyday rituals to explore different cultural mythologies and narratives that separated him from many conceptual artists of his generation. For a period between the late 1960s and early 1970s, Ruppersberg developed several series of photographs that privileged a certain kind of neutrality, stillness, and emptiness that resembled the seemingly authorless images of mass-produced postcards or calendars. But in his works the artist often hid distinct clues, like an unopened newspaper left on an unmade bed in a hotel room. In this series Ruppersberg was also interested in the suggestion of narrative or uncanny storytelling through the juxtaposition or sequential arrangement of images.",

Taken outside Palmdale, Littlerock, Pearlblossom, Victorville, and Barstow, towns where the population does not exceed 20,000, Ruppersberg's trip follows the outskirts of Los Angeles. As with many of his other photographic series, the artist here inserted into each view a constant element that disturbs the otherwise quiet scenes: a hand holding an open magazine. By pairing each road sign with magazines as diverse as Playboy, Look, Hulk comics, Arizona Highways or Rona Barrett's Hollywood, Ruppersberg teases the viewer to find a connection between the two.

I painted them sky blue, creating a \"Hole in the Wall\" This deconstruction of \"feminized\" work explores the difficulties in reconciling both low wages and undervalued work via social and political infrastructures, confronting issues of labor and power. The images that I myself perform, present a duality: women dressed in a black tango dance attire while engaging in de-skilled domestic chores; the surreal within non-fiction. The work underscores the intersection of everyday tasks and fantasy. The \"little black dress\" reflects the notion of prosperity in the US; moreover, the black dress is also transformed into a funerary symbol of luto, the Mexican tradition of wearing black for a year after a death.\"",

After receiving a Masters degree in filmmaking from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1997, Weerasethakul commenced a prodigious career in experimental cinema that awarded him the Jury Prize and Palm d'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival for Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives in 2010. As evidenced in feature length works such as Blissfully Yours, Tropical Malady, and Syndrome and a Century, Weerasethakul's films are marked by interplays between organic, natural time and measured cinematic time while drawing from Buddhist narrative structures as well as science fiction themes.",

By encouraging villagers to play dramatic characters whose fates they had followed intimately, the video comments on the manner in which real experience and fantasy mediate and feed back to each other. Weerasethakul calls this phenomenon 'medium addiction,' a term describing a continual Thai fascination with spirits that dwell in a world parallel to everyday life. Critically aware of the mediums of film and video, Weerasetahkul's works capture the manner through which traditional ways of mediating and perceiving the world is transcoded into new forms through new media. With filmed subjects entering television fantasies as easily as the television characters' entering the living rooms and families of the viewers, Haunted Houses reflects the multiple other-worlds haunting the contemporary Thai consciousness in light of new communication technologies brought on by modern infrastructures, urban planning, and modern medicine.

The subject matter of Marcopoulos' photographs and videos have ranged from skateboarding and snowboarding to the New York art scene, including Warhol's Factory, in the 1980's. Now residing in Northern California, Marcopoulos has focused his lens on his family. Often documenting his sons against the California landscape, he has stressed that these photos are not meant to be autobiographical but archetypes of the idea of family. Through his prolific output of books, magazines, films, and exhibitions, Marcopuolos has provided the world with an inside view of cultures that are often inaccessible.",

As Marcopoulos has continued to document his sons, and as they have become teenagers, the images of them begin to closely resemble the teenagers in much of his earlier work. The boys in Markopoulos' images have become less his sons and more anthropological subjects of study, the youths that started his photographic career over thirty years ago. Jackass is a perfect example of the full circle that Marcopoulos' career has made.",

Green Box is a strong example of the current sociopolitical state of California and the grey areas that exist in legislature and at the same time illustrates the unavoidable commercialization of once underground cultures.",

In Picture 066b (Rubiks Cube, Clear Book, Clubmasters, Rubiks Cube, Vintage Pictures Retro Photos Cotton Fabric, Thumb Tack) (2013), an odd combination of objects hover over and under fabric swatches depicting the sky, the beach, and cartoon bananas. Schechter's compositions fabricate ersatz realities, rendering them into a real-unreal, collapsed, two-dimensional space. ",

During this time, Muslims fast and retreat indoors, leaving the city eerily empty. By portraying ordinary citizens from religious minorities, the photographs reclaim the occupation of public space. Domestic gestures are brought forward and presented in the streets. By being so specific about the times and locations where they were shot, Abidi tests the political potentials of these everyday gestures. In Karachi Series I (Chandra Acharya, 7:50pm, 30 August 2008, Ramadan, Karachi) (2009) a middle-aged woman sits in front of a dressing table plaiting her hair. The royal-blue sari suggests her identity as non-Muslim. In Karachi Series I (Ken DeSouza, 7:42pm, 25th August 2008, Ramadan, Karachi) (2009), a man in a white shirt polishes his shoes without further revealing anything else about his identity. Presented in lightboxes, the pictures' backlit luminosity exaggerates their absurdity and strangeness. ",

    "artist_description": "San Francisco-based artist Barry McGee graduated from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1991 with a concentration in painting and printmaking and is considered a central figure in the Mission School movement. His work is heavily influenced by graffiti, comic books, skateboard culture, green culture, and social activism and usually reflects, with a pessimistic view, upon the urban environment that surrounds him. McGee's large-scale painting installations often take a particular iconography in which a background of abstract, acid-colored patterns is overlayed with text and figures.",

Its tiled effect can perhaps be seen as a vertical Carl Andre work and also bears some resemblance to another work in the Kadist Collection, Jedediah Caesar's JCA-25-SC. McGee's installation also echoes the votive altars in the chapels he visited during his residency in Brazil in 1993. One almost expects to see candles lit below the work honoring the dead or loved ones in crisis. This is appropriate since the individual elements in Untitled depict and honor the disenfranchised, outcasts, and sometimes ghosts of San Francisco street life.",

The image of a red door inspires a tension between potential meaning and purposeful ambiguity. The color red on a door in almost every culture, means \"welcome\" and while often it used to symbolize good luck, some say a red door was a sign of a safe house on the Underground Railroad. Youngblood's red door leaves the viewer to wonder about her formal decisions.",

    "artist_description": "Bruce Conner was undoubtedly one of the key figures of America's avant-garde art scene since his work emerged in the late 1950s. Affiliated with the beat community, he was overtly opposed to the academic establishment and worked freely in a variety of media, including drawing, sculpture, painting, collage, photography, and assemblage. However, Conner is most recognized for his films in which he created a unique visual montage through the skillful and pioneering editing of found footage.",

    "description": "Unlike many of his earlier films which often present poignant critiques of mass media and its deleterious effects on American culture, EASTER MORNING, Conner's final video work before his death in 2008, constitutes a far more meditative filmic essay in which a limited amount of images turn into compelling, almost hypnotic visual experience. The video presents us with a reinterpretation of footage from his unreleased avant-garde film, Easter Morning Raga, from 1966. In contrast to his more famous pieces like A Movie (1958) and Crossroads (1976) which are juxtapositions of fragments from newsreels, soft-core pornography, and B movies, the images in Easter Morning serve as a reinterpretation of footage. Here the artist expands the images in duration, gauge, and frame rate, which results in an enigmatic visual transcendence, or \"imagelessness,\" and distances the viewers from their preconceptions of what they are watching. Accompanied by rhythmical music, the collision of images in EASTER MORNING is not only testament to Conner's ability to balance order and chaos, control and chance, but further reveals his abiding interest in alternative ways of seeing and experiencing",

The photographs depict the revival of British punk rock groups in the late 1970s, and the importance of this movement in San Francisco. Some of Conner's photographs from this period were published in the punk magazine Search and Destroy and depicted such significant figures from the scene as Frankie Fix of Crime, the Mutants, Penelope Houston of the Avengers, and Will Shatter of Negative Trend. ",

Beneath the grid is an abstract composition that nonetheless alludes to some spatial arrangement, perhaps referencing an urban setting, with drips of black paint mirroring the look of quickly-sprayed graffiti. Hudson's composition seems to balance gravity and weight, the fluiding of dripping paint and the rigidity of the overlain grid. ",

    "artist_description": "Like many other Latin American artists in the Kadist Collection, Cuban-born Carlos Garaicoa's conceptual works look at architecture as a palpable indicator of the region's socio-political and cultural histories. Working since the early 1990s in a wide range of media that includes sculpture, drawing, video, and photography, Garaicoa explores architectural forms and urban landscape aiming to reveal the multiple facets of the modern project's failure in the Latin American context. His work is influenced in particular from growing up in Havana, a socialist city where unfulfilled utopias meet the traces of an oligarchic past in every building's facade.",

Here, Garaicoa's interest in vernacular Cuban architecture shifts towards the European context: a series of twelve nineteenth-century French engravings have been reworked into delicate paper models. Here, the two-dimensional old-school architectural renderings have become the foundation for new hollow three-dimensional structures. Reminiscent of pop-up storybooks, the small-scale paper forms have also been augmented with black paper shapes, which both resemble the images in a shadow theater and recall abstract modernist forms.",

The Freeway Series was developed in 1995, right after the artist's inclusion in that year's Whitney Biennial. As if suggesting that her work should not be restricted to being seen through overtly political or activist lenses, this series lends insight into the city of Los Angeles via its most characteristic urban feature: its highways. By documenting the monumental concrete structures devoid of humans or vehicles, one is suddenly conscious of their real scale, an element only emphasized by the small format of the printed photographs. The otherwise unnoticed massive structures are thus made strange. Like Allen Ruppersberg's Untitled (City Limits), which also are taken along the freeway, Opie's photographs have particular resonance within the Kadist's \"101 Collection.\" ",

Opie is known for her honest portraits of diverse individuals, from LGBT people to football players, and the self-portrait has also been a long-standing and important part of her practice. Instead of hiding her sexuality and interest in sadomasochism, Opie wears it proudly. Photographed at a time when artistic freedoms were generally under attack in America, Opie's full-frontal reveal is a kind of revolutionary moment, signifying that expression cannot and will not be suppressed.

The Freeway Series was developed in 1995, right after the artist's inclusion in that year's Whitney Biennial. As if suggesting that her work should not be restricted to being seen through overtly political or activist lenses, this series lends insight into the city of Los Angeles via its most characteristic urban feature: its highways. By documenting the monumental concrete structures devoid of humans or vehicles, one is suddenly conscious of their real scale, an element only emphasized by the small format of the printed photographs. The otherwise unnoticed massive structures are thus made strange. Like Allen Ruppersberg's Untitled (City Limits), which also are taken along the freeway, Opie's photographs have particular resonance within the Kadist's \"101 Collection.\" ",

She wears an expression of both pleasure and intensity as she points a gun at someone or something outside of the frame. Raven (gun) (1994) is not so much threatening as full of sexuality and potential energy. Opie often photographs her friends, of whom Raven is one, and here she captures Raven in the intimate act of role playing. Instead of keeping such activities behind closed doors, Opie brings sexuality fully into view in an effort to question and widen our definition of normalcy. ",

This visual echo both suggested reflection and called attention to the physical viewing conditions. The muffled poles seemed to connect the spaces, to hold them up and together, while the fixity of their positions was in tension with the idea of movement suggested by the allusion to a walking-aid.",

In one of his best-known interventions, he arranged the fabrication of a painted aluminum replica of a toy fire truck, but at the size of an actual fire truck, and parked it outside the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Though playful, Ray's work often disturbs assumed cultural notions. Family Romance (1993) is a fiberglass sculpture of a nuclear family. Mother, father, and two young children stand holding hands, naked and eerily scaled so that they are all the same height. While Ray's subjects are varied, they consistently engage with deeply rooted assumptions about what is \"correct\" or \"right\" in order to investigate the power structures that underlie relationships.",

Its quasi-scientific method of documentation calls into question the idea of art as purely aesthetic expression. It also says something about the essential consumerism that underlies the art market.",

By adhering to self-defined processes, he explores the structures by which we make meaning, supplanting objective claims with the infinitely interpretable. Gaines is currently based in Los Angeles, where he teaches at California Institute of the Arts. He is influenced by John Cage, and like Cage's, his work has served as a seminal guidepost for a younger generation of concept-oriented image makers.",

Each is pictured four times: a photograph of the plant, a photograph of its shadow, a drawing of the plant, and a drawing of its shadow. Instead of lending structure to disparate entities, this system serves a counterintuitive purpose, dissolving the object. Just as meaning can be drained from a word through relentless repetition, Gaines's thorough application of an invented representational system undermines the thing-ness of the simplest thing. Here, the artist effectively questions a concept as vast as objective truth by presenting an alternate theory of an object as ordinary as a houseplant.",

Instead of reproducing the images himself, Chen invited the public to participate in their making by using their fingers to paint directly on the paper or canvas. The resulting paintings made from hundreds of individual thumbprints embody and metaphorize the fragility and uncertain future of collective memories in a time of rapid urban expansion and globalization.",

Cooperating with the Chinese Kuomintang, the American CIA established something called Western Enterprises, an agency whose main tasks included training an anti-Communist National Salvation Army (NSA) for a surprise attack on Communists in mainland China and establishing Taiwan as a base for anti-Communist operations in Southeast Asia. Narrated from the point of the view of the artist's father, once a member of the NSA, the project interweaves personal experience with historical events. The restaged ruins of the old Western Enterprise base have a haunting atmosphere, silently recounting the complex history of Taiwanese-American relations in an era of global tensions and conflicts.

Along with artists such as Bahc Yiso, Beom Kim, and Lee Bul, Choi was part of a generation whose unique and varied practices gave rise to Seoul's burgeoning art scene in the 1990s. Trained in Korea during a period of rapid modernization and economic growth, Choi's work acknowledges and internalizes the processes of consumption and the distribution of goods and has resulted in his being recognized as the leader of Korea's pop art movement. Often infusing his works with a hint of humor, Choi creates monumental installation with everyday objects. His works also touch on issues of accessibility in art and contemporary culture, concepts of individual authorship and originality in art, and they comment on the privileged environment of art institutions and the prized status of artworks amidst a consumer-frenzied world.

And though his works share a similar sensibility to Claes Oldenburg's oversized sculptures from everyday objects, Choi draws from his immediate surroundings and life experience. Public sculptures with a flower theme are often used to decorate the rapidly urbanized cities in Asia, which are constructed with concrete and steel materials. Ironically, these public sculptures are usually also superficial and made from the same unnatural materials. Thus, while seeming to be a celebration of nature's beauty and the need for imagination when living in an environment with a diminishing natural aesthetic, Flower Tree embodies the paradox of modern life.",

An orange-haired figure, oar positioned in mid-stroke, looks ahead whether toward an edge or an infinite expanse, it is impossible to tell. Echoing a trope that recurs in Greek epic poetry, transcendental painting, and current-day reality television, the character is alone with nature. We witness and likely empathize with his voyage. ",

It consists of three small paintings: one of a man with a head of multicolored fragments (I Am a Human), one of an abstract rainbow-colored geometric form on foil (Abstract Foil), and one of what appears to be a brightly burning star or a representation of the Big Bang (No Humans IV). In a playful but serious manner, it envisions the evolution of the world and the creative forces at play in nature and humankind. ",

Stacked in the shape of a cube and available for visitors to take away, the passports did not offer citizenship, but rather invited participation in a sense of borderless \"being.\" Colter Jacobsen's Untitled (Untitled Passport II) is a diptych showing two-page spreads from Gonzalez-Torres's booklet. The perfect graphite renderings freeze the book with its pages splayed, wings perpetually open. But we cannot help feeling that the boundless generosity of Gonzalez-Torres's piece finds a limit in Jacobsen's unique, but copied, original. These images are behind glass, their meanings overtly codified by the artist, whose notes appear in pencil around the edges. ",

The colors are tweaked into a world of cartoon and candy, and it is covered by leaping energetic figures and flying squirrels. One realizes, though, that the image is of the World Trade Center exploding into flame, creating a strange contrast with the painting's colors and the other images. The combination is peculiar because the role the explosion serves here is non-specific. The image loses its totemic weight, as it seems to not matter what particular explosion this is. The picture exists in a strange cultural subconscious of flight, candy, blockbuster movies, and the news, tied together by delicate tight painting.",

This commissioned piece combines his bombastic and playful style with a tribute to San Francisco's thriving arts and culture scenes. It is a lively depiction of famous landmarks in the city, and a somewhat fanciful and lighthearted recapitulation of how a potential earthquake would shake things up in the ultimate \"boy zone.\"",

    "artist_description": "For more than three decades, Los Angeles-based artist Daniel Joseph Martinez has used every form at his disposal to investigate raw aspects of American culture, dipping adeptly into derangements of body and brain, and of individual and society. In a well-known piece he produced for the 1993 Whitney Biennial, he replaced the text on the museum's admission ticket with a phrase: \"I Can't Ever Imagine Wanting to Be White.\" Visitors held the sentiment in their hands and kept it in their pockets. In The House America Built (2004), he recreated in exacting detail the cabin in which the Unabomber penned his manifesto. While Martinez's concepts are airtight, they leave ample space to implicate the viewer. Martinez's work prompts more than finger pointing; it catalyzes introspection, signaling the necessity of taking stock of one's own role in perpetuating difficult if ubiquitous images. ",

Against a bare white background, the men appear unexpectedly vulnerable, caught between performance and rehearsal, public and private.

The project appropriates recent trends towards hyperrealism in the female centric baby doll making and collecting communities. This style of doll is known as a \"reborn.\" Grounded in fantasy, the vernacular surrounding these dolls often addresses them as living babies. For this project, Holman is interested in capitalizing on the inherent fantasy play potential of these objects.",

He lived and worked for most of his life in Mexico, although he also traveled extensively to such places as Russia, America, France, Spain. He was (twice) married to the (also extremely famous) Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. Rivera catalyzed the Mexican mural movement in the early part of the century, pushing the national art into a new, socially aware era. He is most famous for his large-scale murals, frescoes, and artistic collaborations that spoke to labor issues, unions, and political radicalism.",

Lê's artistic practice centers on his lived experience of political and social conditions in his native Vietnam; he and his family fled the country via Thailand in 1979 and immigrated to the United States. Lê interweaves the experiences that helped shape his identity with Vietnamese national mythologies, collective memories, and expanded cultural histories. Incorporating imagery from a variety of sources, such as archival photographs, documentaries, Hollywood films, and Vietnamese iconography, Lê's investigations raise critical questions about the distribution, reception, and consumption of images, and how images inform national identity.",

The title of the series is translated from the Khmer phrase Tuol Sleng, which literally means a poisonous hill or a place on a mound to keep those who bear or supply guilt, and the photographs came from the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum in Cambodia, a former prison where at least 200,000 Cambodians were executed during the reign of the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979. In this particular image, three men stand against the backdrop of what looks like a prison interior. Their identities are unknown. The ghostly, illuminated space creates a strange effect of time traveling, transporting viewers back to the historical event depicted. The men's gazes seem to tell stories that have been buried in collective memory. For Lê, the act of appropriating, recycling, and remixing imagery is a means of rescuing both images and the memories embedded within them.",

    "artist_description": "Doug Aitken's work started to draw international attention when his installation Electric Earth earned the International Prize at the 1999 Venice Biennale, which was organized by renowned Swiss curator Harald Szeemann. Interested in breaking conventional narratives, Aitken emphasizes circularity and non-linearity in his monumental site-specific installations. This monumentality is usually expressed in Aitken's tendency to combine apparently disconnected fragments in order to create epic films. Although this aspect of his work differs from the all-encompassing wholes sought by modernism, Aitken's films play with the imaginary and surreal in a way that flirts with the notion of utopia. The artist uses pop culture and, especially, the film industry as sources for his compelling and immersive environments. Aesthetic elements such as coloration, light and space and a careful editing process give his films a contemplative mood.",

In this film, Aiken's allusion to \"the frontier\" and iconic imagery like the cowboy suggest that the American West Coast as a cultural construction. These notions are reinforced by two key elements in the film: its protagonist, the iconic West Coast artist Ed Ruscha, and its reference to the cinematic and the experience of the movie theater. The film is structured as a journey in time, from day to night. The completed film was shot in different places around the globe, including Los Angeles, Rome, South Africa, and Israel, which suggests the blurring boundaries of the unknown and emphasizes both fictive and real landscapes.",

    "description": "Eamon Ore-Giron's new commissioned video project Bite Work, is an experimental genre breaking video that is part-performance, part-conceptual and part-comical addressing issues of mediation, surveillance and trust. The main characters in the video wear traditional dance masks of \"La Chonguinada\" rituals from Peru and attempt to dance while being bitten by trained attacked dogs. Through this act, the dogs simultaneously become sculptural obstacles and dancers. The trained dogs, Belgian Malinois, have become the new darling and weapon for both the US military, Border Patrol and US law enforcement in their fight against terrorism and illegal immigration; and well known recently for being the dogs that helped capture and kill Osama Bin Laden. The musical narrative for the video is a free-form cumbia music composed by the artist and members of the Los Angeles-based band OJO that mixes hints of cumbia with electronic and ambient sounds. The video captures encounters between cultural memory and trauma by using both ritual and performance, yielding the appearance and disappearance of a hallucinatory narrative into a psychological sound experiment.",

Each episode is an action performed by some combination of his two young cousins, nephew, and younger brother. In one, a boy is shot to death inside a pickup truck. In another, two of them endure a brick-carrying competition. In another, a boy digs his grave. The work is about a collective social condition of survival and endurance, and it is inextricable from the broader context of contemporary Mexico, especially its skyrocketing crime rates and the disaster of its national economy. By using reenactment as an artistic medium, Aragón attempts to educate his young family members to avoid criminal entanglements.",

Highly critical of modernism, Kienholz's theatrical assemblages of found objects and decaying detritus often refer to current events and social issues.",

The concepts, materials, and strategies of his oeuvre reflect a sophisticated understanding of \"fine art,\" crafts, as well as street art. For example, Nugroho's use of embroidery is inspired by local street gangs whose jackets are embroidered with their logos and by the embroidered badges worn by local government officials to announce their affiliations. After the Indonesian Reformation in 1998, Nugroho started to use caricature in his work to criticize the government's policies about democracy, freedom, and censorship. These metamorphic figures, their surroundings, and the idioms indicate the dysfunction of contemporary Indonesian society as well as the tribulations of the world at large.",

Nugroho's work both preserves traditional culture and offers a contemporary interpretation of it through his insertion of comical figures to comment on current social conditions. Moving Landscape includes characters such as a diamond-headed man, a UFO, and other items that appear frequently in Nugroho's drawings and murals. The shadows and silhouettes rotate in a custom-made, lit tent structure to create a fantasy world that blurs the line between daily life and fiction. The narratives here are complex and ambiguous and speak to a range of psychological states that echo everyday reality.",

    "artist_description": "Over a roughly thirty-year period, conceptual and multidisciplinary artist Eleanor Antin has been creating narrative images in photography, video, film, performance, and installation. Her practices blur fiction and history, often with humorous wit, theatrical sensibility, and allegorical impulse. During her early career, Antin was associated with a group of artists who were recognized for returning the element of narrative to contemporary art, which until the 1970s had been dominated by highly abstract, purist work.",

Over two-and-a-half years, Antin photographed the boots against different backdrops across the U.S., and then turned the pictures into postcards, which she then mailed to approximately 1,000 people around the world. In conjunction with the boots' \"arrival\" in New York City, the postcards were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art. The project speaks not only to the reproduction and dissemination of images, but also about how the material reality of the images their settings and their existence in mailboxes was in stark contrast to the everyday lives of the people who received the cards. As with all \"mail art\" which had begun with the Fluxus movement in the late 1950s and was on the rise in the late 1960s, using the postal service enabled artists to completely bypass the traditional art-world distribution system, and allowed Antin to expand or compress time as the narrative required.",

On one level, the Last Postcards analogize the nineteenth-century explorer with the contemporary artist who looks for purpose in their work. This series continues Biernoff's interest in the construction of myths and, to a certain extent, of utopias, ideas which have deep resonance in the cultural imagery of the West Coast. The careful, painted reproduction of a mass-produced object like a postcard reinforces this fictive aspect.",

Although the imagery present in her work might seem nostalgic upon first encounter, Biernoff's complex tableaux often reveal the artist's skeptical look towards her subjects matters. The work featured in the 101 Collection, They Were Here (2010), constitutes a clear example. The 16 ft long tableau confronts the viewer with a seemingly paradisiacal scene: a tropical deserted island with white sands and blooming trees appears to be a coveted destination. However the scene quickly turns into a dystopian image, once one pays attention to the small details camouflaged inside it: an erupting volcano or a dead bird. Biernoff places a pair of binoculars in front of the painting to reinforce this idea. Looking through their fake mdf lenses, the painted landscape is rendered blurry. The whole scene acts up as the backdrop of a theater act and the prop quality of its elements suggests a certain lightness associated with utopian dreams. ",

A poetic and metaphoric sensibility underlies his practice, which ranges from single-channel videos to video installations and documentaries. Some of his works begin with actions executed for the camera; others use autobiographical experiences to illustrate the emotional stress of cultural displacement or to reveal memory as an unstable process of endless revision. Dulzaides oscillates between his American and Cuban identities, and he views his bicultural background as a bridge. He has received prestigious awards from the Cintas Fellowship, Creative Work Fund, Art Matters, and the Rome Prize among others and his work has been included in biennials, museums, contemporary galleries and art centers around the world.",

The movie was not well received by the Russian or Cuban public and was almost completely forgotten until its rediscovery thirty years later by American filmmakers. The movie's acrobatic tracking shots and idiosyncratic mise-en-scène prompted Hollywood directors like Martin Scorsese to campaign to restore the movie in the early 1990s. In 2006, Dulzaides traveled to Cuba to remake a small part of the film which became Scene I Am Cuba, a two-fold narrative in which one story line is based on a real event, and the other is the process of turning evidence into the theatrical.",

For Arturo, searching for this primary element, he turns to not water but concrete the underlying texture of our contemporary world. For the characters in González's novel, their fate is pre-determined, frozen like Arturo's oceanic waves in solid concrete. There is no escaping from modern civilization, no going backwards. ",

In addition to ethnography a research method adopted as a \"medium\" by many artists Montezemolo works with various media including installation, cartography, video, digital photography, industrial materials, performance, and archival documents. Her art practice straddles various disciplines, sensibilities, and methodologies, including institutional critique, social art, and indigenous media.",

This unforeseen deviation is dissected in terms of affects in the time frame of 5 minutes. The affects that emerge in the piece are characterized by a sense of movement between pain and hope, and a work of association between cancer and expectancy. The concept of resistance and fireflies is taken from [Georges] Didi-Huberman's work on the political relevance of the survival of fireflies as a metaphor for the contemporary importance of an intermittent resistance opposed to an inoperable, redemptive, absolute one.\"",

    "artist_description": "Fran Herndon was born in Oklahoma in 1929, then moved to San Francisco in 1957, where she came into contact with Jack Spicer, who encouraged her painting practice by motivating her to study at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute). They collaborated on a few important poetry works including Homage to Creeley Heads of the Town Up to the Aether and J magazine. In each instance, Herndon's graceful, looping, lithographs are not mere illustrations of Spicer's text, but enter into a mutually enriching dialogue with it. ",

    "description": "Working independently, Herndon experimented at the forefront of a now-canonical method appropriation by painting additions into found images from magazines such as Life and Sports Illustrated in a way that imbues the resulting works with mythical significance. Associated with the Beat movement, her work is integral to that part of the history of San Francisco. White Angel (1962), painted in the year of Marilyn Monroe's death, portrays the actress in a process of devolution. Pictured upright in Vogue at the top-right of the frame, she sinks in stages to its lower left, increasingly engulfed by encroaching layers of paint and paper. Beneath fiery, scribbled, gestural marks and surrounded by foreboding, masked figures, her famous, partially obscured smile looks like a grimace. ",

It often relates the poetic and political to technological and societal progress, national borders, localism and globalism, and specific areas and instances of conflict. Though he creates in many forms and formats, performance is central to his practice. Whether they involve retracing a 1948 Arab-Israeli map division originally marked in green with a leaking can of green paint, or walking the streets of Mexico City with a loaded handgun, Alÿs's performances often captured on video define their surroundings through gestures that are sometimes subtle, and always insightful.",

PoT was an IBM sponsored documentary that visualized the relative scale and limits of the known universe, both macro and microscopic, through a sequence of magnifications by 10-to-the-x-power. Using the picnic as human-scale index, Futurefarmers capture their meetings with scholars through audio, photography, and distributed the results publicly through through a website and publication. Futurefarmers work closely with each scholar to visually represent ideas ranging from microbial ecology to astro-physics.",

This one was made of white plastic record sleeves that Orozco arranged on the damp roof of the gallery. He left it out overnight, and by morning there was a layer of ice coating it a serendipitous frozen portable puddle. The work highlights Orozco's flexible practice and trust in chance encounters.",

Through his collages and sculptures, he playfully charts transactions and creates systems that speak about both everyday life and the global economy. To make Self-Portrait as Symmetric Retention and Flow Chart (2012), he sculpted a form mimicking a man's thighs out of gold-foiled isolation foam. Dangling between the thighs are two transparent plastic bags, one filled with clear liquid and the other filled with yellow liquid. In a humorous way, Kuri draws attention to these innocuous materials possess and the way in which they weave themselves silently into the rhythm of our lives. ",

With his homemade Super 8 and 16mm potboilers and melodramas of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, he became legendary as a distinctive and outrageous underground filmmaker whose work influenced many other artists including Andy Warhol, John Waters and David Lynch. After his 1980s transition to the video medium, he remained a master of genre manipulation and subversion, creating hundreds of brilliantly edited, hilarious, observant, often diaristic videos with an 8mm camcorder, dime-store props, not-so-special effects, and using friends as actors and the \"pageant that is life\" as his studio.",

In different ways, zombies are present here as an icon of coming apart, yet they retain a persistent thereness. In Zombie Swallows The World, the image of the figure is almost overcome by strong light that visually blows away the edges of the body. In Zombie Examined, the frayed edges of the body are undone by a clinical look, rather than a visual effect. The piece presents what is actually one of the clearer of Pfau's zombie renderings, and certainly the most precisely illustrative in this set. ",

When exhibiting the work, the artist produces a false statement claiming that he has paid an illegal worker from North Korea to wear the suit and to maintain a lounging posture for a certain length of time. But both the performer and the financial transaction existed only in the text, truths concealed by the costume and social propriety. By interchanging physical realities and contexts and obscuring details, Gimhongsok challenges the effectiveness of visual and textual communication to create a potential moral anxiety in the viewers.",

From mundane objects and materials such as venetian blinds, theatrical and decorative lights, infrared heaters, scent emitters, and fans, Yang creates complex and nuanced installations that are informed by poetry, politics, and human emotions. Her works explore hidden spaces that might be considered marginal, but to the artist constitute profound backdrops for understanding vulnerable sites where informal development can occur. In her works, artificial approximations of sensual experiences   heat, light, smell, and humidity conjure other places, other people. Yang's work captivates precisely because of its ambiguity, which is rooted as much in the conceptual art of the 1960s and 1970s as it is in current theoretical discourses.",

She asks probing questions about the everyday and its complex relationship with history and ideology; her subject matter ranges from religious rituals to war and the sexual iconography of the Kama Sutra. Working with a diverse range of materials and media, Abbas frequently intertwines the contemporary with the classic to offer up a critique of both modern Western and Islamic cultures. ",

A closer examination, however, reveals that a key element the minaret has been systematically removed, thereby changing profoundly the history and religious character of the city. The work is a response to a November 2009 referendum in Switzerland that approved a ban on the construction of new minarets in that country. It was also a crucial time in Turkey's negotiation for entrance into the European Union. Instead of making a direct, didactic comment on the controversy, however, Abbas offers up a clever question regarding how landmarks are interpreted in vastly different ways depending on their cultural context. In the Western imagination, minarets are political symbols as much as they are religious architecture. In the Muslim world, they serve as mnemonic devices that enable residents to recognize their own city. ",

I am the Greatest replicates the look and feel of a campaign button in oversized proportions, replicating the familiar phrase most closely associated with boxer Muhammad Ali. The ambiguous boosterism of Thomas' work floats freely on a white background, detached from its cultural history, but still naggingly familiar. ",

The project began in 2005 when Fletcher visited the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City. He was shocked by images that depicted the lasting effects of the war and the atrocities committed by the United States. Fletcher felt it important that these images be seen and discussed within an American context and, using a handheld digital camera, he photographed all of the museum's images and labels. At that moment, Fletcher's project resonated directly with the American intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. The artist took extreme care in shooting the pictures from an angle that would diminish the flash reflection on the surfaces, and paid attention to capture the wall colors and the explanatory labels. In this sense, Fletcher's re-creation of the Vietnamese installation not only shares important information but also recontextualizes it in a way that comments on the subjective and constructed nature of representation, both artistic and historic.",

Chong's works have been considered \"archetypally conceptual\" and recall frameworks of the 1960s in their potential to address collective visions of futuristic utopias.

Chong divides these archetypes into three over-arching notions: the Hide-away, the Castaway and the Prisoner. A novella from Stephen King's Different Seasons collection, Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption tells a story of assumed identities and prisoners' escape to reflect on the economic infrastructures inside and outside prison as well as the thin boundaries separating the two in this case, a Rita Hayworth poster concealing a hole in the prison wall dug for jailbreak.

In the video, eight protagonists act out their daily lives. The setting is a soon-to-be-demolished public housing facility in Singapore, a country in transition from a mindset of Eastern collectivism to global neoliberalism. These individuals have lived hermetically and absurdly in their apartment space until this moment, when a magical and mysterious cloud appears, connecting their seemingly disjointed lives. It is a story about the tension between solitude and togetherness, privacy and communal experiences. The symbolic cloud embodies both divine illumination and hallucination.",

Peng sees himself as an intellectual who uses art and aesthetics as critical intervention. Believing that art should be a tool of propaganda with the potential to awaken the collective conscience, Peng explores the coexistence of oppositional poles as a type of cyclical relational structure. The joining of oppositions is visible in the work Both Died of the Nanjing Massacre (2009), which depicts the upper torso of Japanese General Tojo Hideki joined to the lower half of one of the 20,000 Chinese women raped by Japanese troops during the siege of Nanjing in 1937. In another work, Farfur the Martyr (2009), Peng Hung-Chih deployed a similar strategy by joining the body of the crucified Christ to the head of Farfur, a Mickey-Mouse type character, who hosted a children's television show broadcast by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. Farfur, who was murdered on the show by an Israeli, \"becomes a tool for anti-American and anti-Israeli sentiments.\" To Peng, such inversions of meaning and intent \"can be seen as a real-life theatre of the absurd.\" ",

Specifically, the piece questions the influence of Confucian teachings on role of the intellectual in contemporary society. While Confucianism has its own ritual systems and temples, it is not known to be overtly concerned with the supernatural beings such as gods and demons. Yet, the video shows a dog making phrases from the Analects appear by licking a wall repeatedly as if the dog is a medium channeling the spirit of the sage. Dispelling the magical with the wisdom of Confucius by ending with the sentence: \"Confucius did not talk about prodigies, force, disorders, and gods,\" the performance takes on the form of a miraculous apparition brought on by a prodigious dog, creating an ambiguous status for how the role of Confucius is received.

The black paper enacts a kind of cinematic \"jump cut\" on the article, while simultaneously drawing attention to the medium of the film, as well as the photograph reproduced in this newspaper article. The composition has a casual and dynamic stylishness to it (as do the movie stars lying in bed), which is contradicted somewhat by the static utilitarian aesthetic of the piece's construction. The tape and staples hold the more dominant visual elements in place and recall printmaking tools.",

In this way, with keen, deadpan humor, the artist refers to all the stereotypes and social clichés associated with drug abuse particularly in the 1970s. At the same time U.S. Treasury Nose suggests illegal activity related to drugs within the American government and its policies.",

Similar techniques were used to produce Stowe (2006), an ambiguous work that refers to the American writer Harriet Beecher Stowe. Folded and curled, the fabric reveals an obdurate materiality through the density and thickness of the color and the texture. Welling's unique processes continuously challenge the criteria and reception of abstract photography.",

The scene represents the collision of two fictional worlds both geared toward children in which being well moneyed is assumed to be a universal aspiration. With the free market unleashed, these two nostalgic, seemingly innocuous figures are made to compete against one another in a confrontation that begins to read as sinister.",

Set within a lush, green forest, we see first several children come into the frame, walking towards us, as a disembodied voice counts off \"Tres...quatro...cinco…\" A game of hide-and-seek is at hand, and sounds of the girl counting are met with scattering children. In the first shot, while everyone else disperses, one boy advances steadily toward the camera, holding a scavanged stick in his hands, wielding it like a gun. He takes aim and makes a shooting noise; then, the camera reverses. The soundtrack repeats, as the girl, now in the frame, recites her counting. \"Tres...quatro...cinco...seis…\" At the sound of the fake gunshot, a wound appears on the girl's belly, and she falls, heavily, into the green growth of the forest.",

While the resulting geometric sculptures and the industrial process involved in making them may recall minimalist practices from the 1960s, Caesar's \"metaphorical rebirth\" of the materials also gives them a strong, expressive abstract character",

This technical rework allows for a clinical inspection of the material contents of the piece and the resulting slanted industrial monolith echoes minimalist sculpture, although with a different expressive texture. Indeed, Untitled can be seen as a contemporary pyramid with a painterly surface. Its transparency reveals that the base and the top have been created out of a single cast piece cleanly bisected into two fragments which were subsequently placed as if in a mirror so that both sides of the split are visible.",

Most of the time he begins with a collection of found objects, which he encases in resin, often using cardboard boxes as a molds. The resulting casts are then cut into blocks, flat slices and other shapes cross-sections of the original objects that nullify their original function and form and transform them into a new kind of material. While the resulting geometric sculptures and the industrial process involved in making them may recall minimalist practices from the 1960s, Caesar's \"metaphorical rebirth\" of the materials also gives them a strong, expressive abstract character.",

However factual, the image indicates certain enigmatic significance, allowing multiple interpretations. Wall encourages the viewer to engage with the scenario to imagine the before and the after of the moment. Compared to his earlier work, Wall's photographs appear to be straight-up snapshots, exhibiting less manipulative details. The fictional details are not conveyed through obvious arrangements but due to the very nature of photographs: What they record is always an incomplete view of the world.",

In Eniko Mihalik (2012), the camera captures a glimpse of the eponymous Hungarian model as seen through a rearview mirror. They are both two examples of the artist's many enigmatic photographs of models, actors, musicians, and other powerful figures rooted in the celebrity-driven culture of Los Angeles. Catching a glimpse of the model, the viewer enters into the world of the celebrity. This photograph makes us question what are we are looking at (and why we are present in) this seemingly ordinary situation. Burton employs soft light to emphasize the woman's ideal beauty while problematizing the situation that affords the viewer this peek into her life. Like much of Burton's work, Eniko Mihalik reflects both his experience as a commercial photographer and his interest in the voyeurism, desire, vulnerability, and power of the photographic act. ",

In Eniko Mihalik (2012), the camera captures a glimpse of the eponymous Hungarian model as seen through a rearview mirror. They are both two examples of the artist's many enigmatic photographs of models, actors, musicians, and other powerful figures rooted in the celebrity-driven culture of Los Angeles. Catching a glimpse of the model, the viewer enters into the world of the celebrity. This photograph makes us question what are we are looking at (and why we are present in) this seemingly ordinary situation. Burton employs soft light to emphasize the woman's ideal beauty while problematizing the situation that affords the viewer this peek into her life. Like much of Burton's work, Eniko Mihalik reflects both his experience as a commercial photographer and his interest in the voyeurism, desire, vulnerability, and power of the photographic act. ",

These actions focus on cycles of physicality and visibility, and draw from her experiences as a professional dominatrix, champion submission wrestler, and artist's model. Locke often creates a separation between her live actions and the audience through the use of material barriers, live video feeds, multiple camera perspectives, wireless microphones, and mini-cameras. These audio-visual reiterations produce a ripple effect, flattening, repeating, echoing, amplifying, and displacing the action by turning it  as well as the audience performing its own spectatorship  into an image of itself.",

When it comes her turn to \"perform,\" Bornstein displays mundane and disposable but elaborately archived or framed consumer objects such as coffee lids, plastic straws, candy wrappers, and product labels. Through the medium of public broadcasting, then, she makes visual the frequently overlooked but massive cultural penetration of advertising, and its proliferation of \"throwaway culture\" via images. Further, Bornstein suggests that within a massive and mercurial social network that often places value arbitrarily, any worthless mass-market products can be turned into coveted objects via absurd relations and vice versa.",

Each person displays a different facial expression and body position such as reading a book, arms open for a hug, holding a knife, raising a fist to take an oath. Each gesture reflects some essential social aspect of everyday life: hugging is about caring, taking oath has to do with politics, reading relates to acquiring knowledge, and raising a knife indicates violence. As a result of a hidden vibration machine, the images' projection screens oscillate vigorously and the contradiction between the shaking screens and the static human figures creates an absurd effect. Through this imposed trembling, Jiang suggests the invisible power that controls modern human behavior. These seemly \"out-of-control\" actions are often ironically conceived as the most adaptable and mutually-agreed upon tenets of social activity.",

His photographs have a dispassionate attitude towards the unprecedentedly fast urbanization of China. Through long-term exposure sometimes over fifty minutes and image manipulation, Jiang creates surreal and apocalyptic scenarios that suggest a disastrous future. For Jiang, skyscrapers are spectacles that evidence the mythologization of modern urban life. And by virtue of his technical strategies, the illuminated skyscrapers in Illuminant a hotel, a government building, a news agency appear bizarrely alive as if creatures from outer space.

Yet, ambiguous lights blink from buildings and yachts still sail on the water, and further observation reveals these structures to be miniatures manipulated by the artist through Photoshop and other postproduction image tools. The model city's surroundings are themselves real abandoned spaces, perhaps an empty room, a wait-to-be demolished building, or a discarded bathtub. In this way, Unregistered City is a double play on a dystopia vision of urbanization: It is an imagined city built upon the actual ruins of cities and human life. Through a dark and entropic undertone and estranged urban arrangements, the artist does not just critique, but poses fundamental questions.",

Interested in combining the mundane, the historical, and the mythological, Wang's works range from depicting the \"plight of peasants occupying an abandoned housing project in Sichuan Province to films of post-1949 China during the height of Communist fervor and stories from the Tang Dynasty.\" Particularly, poignant is the cognitive dissonance formed between presentations of the past and present in Wang's work.

The performance begins with two broad-knife-wielding characters circling each other in conventional operatic steps. Oblivious to the presence of these two on stage, additional characters, in a mix of period costume and contemporary dress, enter the stage in increasing droves to consume a various of foods laid out on a table until they collapse and pile on top of each other. Invoking the traditional Chinese theatrical trope of a \"three-way fork in the road,\" the piece ruminates on the representation of the visible and the invisible and the simultaneity of past and present as critical reflection on the shortcomings of both antiquarianism and technocratic modernity.

Their bases rest in the observer's space, and their varnished surfaces reflect the surrounding environment. Though best known for his bright colors and polished aesthetic, McCracken's body of work is diverse, ranging from minimalist sculpture to abstract painting. The work is consistently characterized by a search for simplicity, beauty, and the sublime.",

To make his works, Houck arranges an object on a sheet of paper, photographs, and prints it, then places that print back into a new composition, repeating the process again and again until arriving at an aggregate image. The layers appear to be digitally altered, but he does not utilize any postproduction interventions. But Houck is not a purist by any means; he is significantly influenced by his professional experience as a computer programmer, and his artistic methodology mirrors a kind of algorithmic code. By referencing a conventional artistic genre through an iterative and contingent process, Houck offers up photography as a mode of thought. ",

Houck uses a series of self-designed software programs to create these intricate grids of color and line, riffing off of Sol LeWitt, perhaps, in a digital age. Houck takes the output of these programs and then manipulates them manually, creasing the pages of the index print, and then re-photographing them. In the end, this series of Aggregates as the series is called presents a synthesis of digital and analogue methods that toy with the 2-dimensional grid that underpins an entire digital world. ",

The layers appear to be digitally altered, but he does not utilize any postproduction interventions. But Houck is not a purist by any means; he is significantly influenced by his professional experience as a computer programmer, and his artistic methodology mirrors a kind of algorithmic code. By referencing a conventional artistic genre through an iterative and contingent process, Houck offers up photography as a mode of thought.",

The image depicts a box, addressed to the artist's mother, that once contained it can be assumed baby shoes. Houck layers the photograph with multiple exposures, lending an uneasy tripling effect to the static object. Borrowing his title from Ernest Hemingway's enigmatic, apocryphal six-word novel (\"For Sale: Baby Shoes, Never Worn\"), Houck's photograph engages the ideal and image of childhood from the distanced point of view of the camera's lens.

Kuswidananto describes the nation as perpetually in an \"in-between\" state of transition. Thus he has developed the concept of a third reality, third space, or third body an identity specifically for Indonesia that reflects its spatial realities and national character. The uniforms and horse saddles in the installation are of the type used in festival parades. Instead of directly commenting on colonial military history, the ghostly and bodiless outfits hauntingly suggest something out of the past. The addition of video and sound exacerbates this effect. This highly theatrical work not only reenacts traditional mythology but also foregrounds its unstable nature. It is intended to represent a shifting and changing milieu of ideas, events, performances, and meanings.",

He was influenced by fellow Brazilian artists Hélio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, who were also concerned with the unification of body, mind, and language through sculpture, performance, and painting. Leonilson was influenced as well by his Brazilian heritage, and the conflict between his Catholic upbringing and his sexuality. Early in his career he made traditional, non-realistic, colorful, large-scale paintings that depicted everyday objects. Many of these took a somewhat critical tone that specifically addressed the cultural and societal dilemmas facing Brazil and its contemporary citizenry. He moved on to making sewn assemblages made out of materials such as buttons, stones, cloth, canvas, copper wire, and thread. His late works tended to be abstract mixed-media self-portraits that addressed the destruction of his body by the AIDS virus. ",

Through multidisciplinary projects that question notions of class, identity, power, and revolution, he investigates the rejection, assimilation, and mutation that result from the collisions within or between systems of ideology. Born in Guadalajara, Mexico and raised in South Central Los Angeles, Juan Capistran was undocumented until midway through grade school. As a teenager, he gravitated toward graffiti, punk rock, reggae, house music, and DJ culture as tools for crafting a hybrid identity. His work evidences influences as diverse as Malcolm X, Led Zeppelin, and Richard Serra, and quotes keenly and democratically from gang colors to minimalist forms. ",

Growing up in an African-American community in Los Angeles, Capistran has long been influenced by hip-hop culture. The photographs in this print document him surreptitiously breakdancing on Carl Andre's iconic lead floor piece after the guards at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art have left the gallery. Each of the twenty-five frames depicts a classic breakdance move. Wearing a working-class outfit, Capistran intentionally emphasizes the vernacular aspect of this art form and his personal engagement challenges the hierarchy between street culture and high art. ",

Through multidisciplinary projects that question notions of class, identity, power, and revolution, he investigates the rejection, assimilation, and mutation that result from the collisions within or between systems of ideology. Born in Guadalajara, Mexico and raised in South Central Los Angeles, Juan Capistran was undocumented until midway through grade school. As a teenager, he gravitated toward graffiti, punk rock, reggae, house music, and DJ culture as tools for crafting a hybrid identity. His work evidences influences as diverse as Malcolm X, Led Zeppelin, and Richard Serra, and quotes keenly and democratically from gang colors to minimalist forms. ",

White Minority, then, appropriates, recontextualizes, and riffs on language and visual signs to unmoor notions of identity, power, and revolution.",

From left to right, each bill is progressively folded up, step by step, into the shape of a gun. Both a scream and a whisper are capable of conveying the same content, if at drastically different decibels, the artist proposes. The folded guns suggest that United States currency carries with it an implicit violence. Though ordinarily barely audible, Capistran's lucid permutations make that violence loud and clear. From a Whisper to a Scream is also the title of a 1987 horror film (also called The Offspring), in which a historian describes a series of gruesome murders that take place in a small town, the seeming center of an incomprehensibly evil force. In this case, the treacherous power is shown to be ubiquitous the foundation of an economy that permeates everything and leaves no one untouched.",

As a result of her art work and pedagogy, Chicago is the most recognizable feminist artist who gave an authentic voice to women's experiences and their important contributions to human society and culture. In addition to expanding women's rights to encompass a greater freedom of artistic expression, Chicago expanded the definition of art and the role of all artists. Her earliest forays into the art world coincided with the rise of Minimalism, and the Los Angeles-based Finish Fetish movement, which she eventually abandoned in favor of an art practice believed to have greater content and relevance.",

By 1968, the year she began creating Domes, the twenty-nine-year-old artist had moved from Chicago to Los Angeles, graduated from UCLA, and was part of a generation of artists whose work was characterized by of the masculine overtones of Southern California's flourishing car culture. Inspired by new technologies in the auto manufacturing, these \"Finish Fetish\" artists appropriated industrial materials such as car paint or lacquer to create artwork with pristine finishes. Chicago too was interested in using industrial technologies and enrolled in auto body and boat building school. While the geometric forms, meticulously applied finish, and luminous, gradated hues of color in Domes speak to Chicago's interest in the prevailing artistic themes of 1960s Southern California, its intimate scale, round shape, and triangular formation belie her career-long interest in using \"feminine\" forms to promote feminist issues.",

His paintings, constructions, and installations emphasize concept and materiality even-handedly, resulting in works evocative of both intangible theory and concrete spatial relationships. His immersive environment Demon Hill (2010-2011) used gravity as its primary tool, while undermining everything certain about it; inside the space, the most predictable force on Earth operated at an unexpected and deeply disorienting angle. Uncommon sensation is a thread that runs through much of Hoeber's work. The otherworldly springs from the readily available, unusually arranged. His paintings are situated somewhere between Modernism's emphasis on the physical reality of the painting, Postmodernism's fraying of that reality, and Op art's insistence on playing perceptual tricks.

While the minimalist appearance of these works references similarly striped paintings by Frank Stella, Hoeber does not emphasize the painting's underlying structure but instead tugs it apart and obscures it. Layers of paint betray the image not as surface-and-support, but as presence with depth. ",

When a small militia arrived at Vallejo's house to arrest him, he invited them in and shared a meal. The emphasis on the role of food in Morales's version connects this historic event to the current proliferation of food-based culture and social interaction in California.",

Though she graduated from the China Academy of Fine Art with rigorous training in oil painting, Kan quickly adopted video as her primary medium. From often ignored daily life experiences as points of departure, Kan creates a visual diary. Here, the camera amplifies mundane activities to reveal absurd and eerie details. For example, in Kan Xuan, Ai!, she calls and answers her own name among the crowd in subway station; in Eggs, she squeezes and breaks eggs with her hands, and in A Sunny Day two middle-aged men laugh and tickle each other in a public plaza. In other works Kan engages feminist discourse by situating herself in uncomfortable situations or exposing her body, such as standing naked on a public pedestal in A Happy Girl or allowing spiders to crawl over her in Looking Looking Looking For!.",

These highly polished and aestheticized images, create a poetic visual flow. However, in front of each object lies a coin of different value two yuan, one pound, one euro, one dollar that silently reveals the material value of the household supplies. Underneath the video's elegant surface there is a deep sense of critical irony, elaborated in the contradictory nature of the cheap plastic items and their sophistic visual interpretation. Kan poignantly and metaphorically comments on the economic and production at the base of today's global market and shows that extremely influential visual spectacles can be generated by the most everyday of items.

    "description": "Haendel's series Knights (2011) is a set of impeccably drafted, nine-foot-tall pencil drawings depicting full suits of armor. The series riffs on previous investigations by the artist such as his meticulous depictions of masculine political figures, which included a headless J. Edgar Hoover and a Hitler head floating vulnerably in the center of a white expanse (Hitler's iconic mustache was crafted from the artist's pubic hair). Rendered in soft graphite, the imposing Knights embody the ostensibly conflicting ideals of chivalrous deference and invulnerable masculinity.",

With minimal edits, Gilmore's formally considered videos feel incredibly intimate, but can also be painful to watch, as the camera unflinchingly documents all of her repeated falls and setbacks. Appearing strong but not invincible, she often dons pumps, pencil skirts, and other incongruously \"feminine\" attire as she throws herself into these strenuous challenges, suggesting an underlying feminist message about the 21st-century female experience.",

The video presents philosophical explorations of the human desire to defy gravity and time. The minimalist set of a table highlights the intention and persistence of the protagonist rather than technological innovation. The video manipulates the camera angle to distort the appearance of space so that Subbaiah's repeated attempts at beating gravity can achieve momentary flights. As the flight attempts move into the bedroom, what first appears to be a close up of an alarm clock turns out to be an oversized ringing alarm clock further back to create a distortion of space through manipulations in scale. Such effects highlight both the proximity and distance between apparent success and distorted perception.",

Because his pose is static throughout the images, his presence is deemphasized and instead the viewer's attention is drawn to the motion of the flour. The subtle contrast between the fixed and the flowing generates a sense of time and ephemerality, suggesting the infinite possibilities of chance to alter our inflexible perceptions. The aesthetic quality of the flowing flour also evidences the ability of the simplest gesture to generate spectacle.",

In 2003, Kwan manufactured an exhibition history and CV for himself, hosting a retrospective as first solo show towards the end of art school in order to critique the unspoken conventions of the contemporary art system. In general, Kwan's works explore the nexus between art and text and use repetition as a constant measure of time and a metaphor for life as he states: \"Repetition gives the work power.\" He is especially interested in how meaning is constructed, who makes art, and the interaction of other people, places and things as part of the work's cultural context.",

    "description": "One Million is a video work depicting the counting of bills. Divided into three versions, the video first shows a number of Japanese ten-thousand-yen bills being counted without in an orderly, efficient manner. In Two Million, a similar counting of one-thousand-dollar bills from Hong Kong follows. However, a closer viewing of the videos reveal that they were created by looping the same scene of moving fingers, giving the illusion that many bills are being counted when, in fact, only a few are in the scene. Beyond commenting on the illusions of transactions and interdependencies in a regional economy, the video calls attention to the way media distort quantity as well as manipulations of values occurring with the transcoding of economic units into visual data. The false appearance of accountability presented in One Million and Two Million highlight the instability underlying the desire for convenience and efficiency in a globalized, media-dependent economy.

Working often with pinhole photography and mixed media while exploring cityscapes, Leung focuses on the emotional expressions of the urban man through figural portraiture.

Leung is generally concerned with aspects of photography that are not strictly visual and often considers the local population and sites in his photographic installations to reflect a deeper critical engagement with globalization and global consumerism. Working often with pinhole photography and mixed media while exploring cityscapes, Leung focuses on the emotional expressions of the urban man through figural portraiture. Specifically, his photography captures the identity and politics of Hong Kong after its return to China in relation to his photographed subjects. ",

January of 2010 was a time of pro-Democracy demonstrators called for the release of activist Liu Xiaobo, drafter of the Charter 08 manifesto calling for the end of authoritarian rule, was sentenced to 11 years in prison one month earlier. Leung's isolating and highlighting of the photographer by bringing him from the original photograph's background to the foreground of his studio shot calls attention to the two older cameras and the journalist's retro-style clothing. This focus brings forth the multiplicity of gazes present in photojournalism and its implications for free speech and freedom of press across the geopolitical history of Hong Kong. ",

Lambri's methodology draws attention to the viewer's immediate perceptions and is in clear contrast to the established practices of modernist architectural photography, which conflates flawless exteriors with the modern ethos of progress and innovation. Lambri's approach has affinities with two other Los-Angeles artists Catherine Opie and James Welling who are also included in the Kadist Collection. Lambri sees her images as a form of self-portraiture that elaborates on the profound psychological and emotional responses that architectural spaces elicit from their inhabitants: While she is photographing a house, she is also photographing herself being there. Lambri travels extensively to capture the physical topologies of work by Alvar Aalto, Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn, among many others.",

Commissioned by industrialist J. Irwin Miller and his wife Xenia Simons Miller, and built by Eero Saarinen in 1953, the Miller house's open and flowing layout expands upon modernist architectural traditions. It features a flat roof, stone and glass walls, with rooms configured beneath a grid pattern of skylights and supporting cruciform steel columns. Rather than a distanced view of the overall structure favored by modernist architectural photographers like Julius Shulman Lambri instead works from the inside, focusing on Saarinen's windows and the soft, even light. The resulting image is a poetic abstraction, an architectural photograph that yields not only a picture of a building, but suggests what it actually feels like to be in that architectural space.",

Designed by the architect Richard Neutra, its gray glass, white expanses, and simple forms exude austerity. Luisa Lambri's photograph Untitled (Sten-Frenke House #04) (2007) recalls the unembellished elegance of the structure while also alluding to modernist painting; the image is less a picture than an abstract expanse that conveys its own flatness. Whereas avant-garde paintings strove to suggest nothing but their own essence, Lambri inverts this aim, using the two-dimensionality of the photographic print to point elsewhere.",

However, Kirk's passive pose doesn't so much suggest the aftermath of a battle as it does heavy contemplation, depression, or utter despair. Captain X is part of a series of paintings depicting various Star Trek characters who are stricken with human emotion- a tactic that diminishes the mythological grandeur associated with this heroic captain and his indefatigable crew. Captain X, like much of Butler's work, investigates the role of the male authority figure and exposes him at his most vulnerable moments.",

The work delineates an interior space and draws the viewer's attention through the use of aggressive materials, yet there is empty space where we would expect an artwork to be. What is added is ultimately subtracted, since both the \"artwork\" and the void of the gallery space remain equal.",

He consistently explores the culture and politics of the West Coast to produce, as he says, contemporary art that is filtered through a Mexican-American experience.

The work takes as its departure point the history of Wilmington, Ybarra's native hometown in southern Los Angeles. The piece refers to a Civil War era ammunition store that Ybarra found at the heart of the harbor close to Long Beach. The facility was later used as a temporary prison to hold different people coming from Mexico to Los Angeles during the Civil War. The building's walls are covered with different marks and inscriptions from that time what Ybarra likes to call L.A.'s earliest graffiti and which today coexist with recent gang tags. By pointing out the presence of these two kinds of inscriptions in the same historical place, Ybarra furthers his investigation into the intertwining of Mexican-American and Anglo-American social and cultural histories in Southern California.",

These props are part of a performance; he often sets up his studio in public and uses cues from his own journeys as the inspiration for his work. The objects are not dull, but sensuous, creating their own life in a Proustian narrative; slices of apple, for instance, have texture summoning the juiciness of a crisp bite. Lopez carefully creates these phantom objects and imbues them with the colors of memory. Almohada means \"pillow\" in Spanish, and this 2011 sculpture is a literal and playful interpretation. The large pillow made of sheets of paper leans vertically against a wall, and papers printed with images of feathers spill over the top and cascade onto the floor.",

For Lopez, the faithful renderings and artful facsimiles that he creates seem to capture and concretize his experience; his exploration into the simple drawn line as it morphs into a shape, and perhaps into a three-dimensional object is also an exploration of knowledge and the knowable. Lopez's Roca Carbon looks just like what its name implies a dull rock resembling charcoal but is really a fake, made carefully of drawing materials.",

    "description": "For Colombian artist Mateo Lopez, drawing remains the foundation for his artistic practice, which has come to include diligently re-created objects, environments, animations, and even cross-country road trips. For Lopez, the faithful renderings and artful facsimiles that he creates seem to capture and concretize his experience; his exploration into the simple drawn line as it morphs into a shape, and perhaps into a three-dimensional object is also an exploration of knowledge and the knowable. Lopez's Roca Carbon looks just like what its name implies a rock with a graphite sheen to it but is really a fake, made carefully of drawing materials.",

Arranged in a tableau, lit theatrically, and rephotographed, the two-dimensional figures have an embodied presence. While orange and blue lights transform them into a cohesive community, their ordered arrangement also draws out their smallness and flatness, deflating any hypothesis of a great empire or platonic ideal with one carefully calculated swipe.",

As in his analogous portrait of men, the middle section appears twice, on either side of the split, signaling a stutter, a caesura, or a schizophrenic break. Within the cluster, fashion photography exists alongside frescoes, and demure piety butts up against unabashed sexuality. The women are bound not only by a fuchsia floodlight but also by a shared history. Western conceptions of beauty and eroticism are shown to sample widely and gluttonously, from tribal dance to a cowl-necked sweater.",

Looking at the stark contrasts between the oppulent lifestyles of some and the meager existences of others in Colombia, Rojas employs a range of heavily loaded materials in creating two-dimensional works, sculptures, and videos alike. In his paper-based work, Medellin-New York, Rojas uses coca leaves and dollar bills to spell out the words of the two cities, tied together through the illicit exchange of materials used to make the word, gesturing towards the uncomfortable reality of the drug trafficking trade and the complicity of both America and Colombia within that economic system.

The drawing on wood, the popcorn mixture, and the title all manifest a bumpy fullness, a \"more-is-more\" conflation between supposedly eternal spirituality and everyday stuff. The work's title points to a serious timelessness completely belied by the materials. While the composition is attractive, the objects themselves efface a potentially straightforward meaning. This is underscored by the label left on the outer bucket, which keeps it tethered to everyday life and away from the free-floating and romantic mysticism associated with the installations of Joseph Beuys.",

Her drawings, sculptures, and photography are active investigations into our often-fallible notions of history. Stone Deaf (2009) is a direct intervention into Karl Marx's gravesite, for which the artist literally traced the history of Marx's grave. She traveled to Highgate in London seeking the gravesite, only to find a plaque stating that Marx's remains had been removed in 1954 to another part of the cemetery. She discovered that this had taken place at the behest of the British Communist Party, and that the deceased was now in a more prominent location, marked with a bust and a monument. Bonilla's rubbing of the original plaque celebrates an anti-monument, so to speak, calling into question Marx's life and legacy.",

Constantly drawing from classic films, Wong investigates issues around identity, linguistics, translation, dislocation, and history through reenactments of well-known films.

In Ming's version, he plays all four main characters portrayed originally by Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Huston, and Belinda Palmer, shooting against a backdrop of a film set reproduced as wallpaper in a gallery space. Presented as a seven-channel video installation, Making Chinatown is an immersive viewing experience with different scenarios, lines of conversation, and background music, all merged together into one space where the sense of time collapses. The ending fades to black with no reference of the original film's site, precisely echoing the fictional nature of Chinatown as a no-place, constructed in an often-detached cultural context.",

The series grew out of her interest in capturing lost memories and the collective unconscious in rapidly globalizing cities such as Seoul. New Town Ghost documents a young female activist who is standing aggressively on a truck, rapping slam poetry through a megaphone to the rhythm of a nearby drummer. The two performers are from the Yeongdeungpo district, which has been drastically transformed by development from an industrial zone into a \"new town\" full of giant department stores and mega-brands. Yeongdeungpo is symbolic of many transformations witnessed by a young generation of Koreans. For Lim it is a dystopian place where the idea of a better future is simply delusional. The poem, talking about the new malls, the skyscrapers derides not only neoliberalism but also the indifferent citizens who have apparently sold their souls to it.",

In an unusual way, The White Album reminds us that this important New York-focused magazine was originally founded in 1962 in San Francisco to promote Bay Area artists before it moved to Los Angeles in the mid-1960s in search of a wider advertising base. Thomson's encyclopedic gesture not only exposes the magazine's commercial scaffolding, but takes aim at a critical period in the rise of the art market.",

Taking Smith's interest in Hollywood's obsession with the reproduction of the exotic as a point of departure, Bustamante embodies Miss Montez.

The original photographs were taken by anonymous photographers, not as art but as documents of the building of the Panama Canal. The laborers in the images are holding cans of kerosene and spraying it into the foliage. It was a common practice during the building of the canal for American companies and the military to import black workers from the Antilles Islands to spray kerosene to kill mosquitoes and prevent malaria. This practice resulted in massive health problems for the laborers and the disappearance of many species of local wildlife not just insects but also plants and animals. With this work, Wheat uncovers and generates a space where the movement of objects (the movement of objects being the function of the Panama Canal) takes priority over life, art, and society itself. The coming together of the three images into a single work stands as abstract documentation of sterilization both cultural and biological. ",

Her objects, installations, and interventions engender and disrupt a full range of interpersonal arrangements. Wheat is the founder of Project Grow, a Portland based art studio and urban farming program that employs developmentally disabled adults. Founded in 2008, the project investigates the intersection of food, ideology, society, and exchange, while fulfilling an existing need. Wheat earned her BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and an MFA in Social Practice from California College of the Arts. ",

    "description": "Wheat's work is built on a strong conceptual framework that weaves together commentary on social and political issues and the radical potential for change. Be Oblivion, in Disconnect (2011) is a sculpture and an intervention. Two cardboard boxes house white neon letters that collectively have the potential to spell \"Be Oblivion.\" The dismembered phrase is rendered powerless in its present state; the potential power lies with the viewer, who could conceivably reconstruct it. The boxes sit on wooden pallets of the kind typically used for shipping; by painting them white and repurposing them as pedestals, Wheat removes them from circulation as carriers of commodities. The simple cardboard boxes are also discarded shipping materials. The words \"Be Oblivion\" are a seeming command to fade away into obscurity. This simple phrase resonates as a harbinger of defeat. Perhaps the provocative installation is a pointed statement about our collective loss of power: in politics, commerce, war, international relations, social issues, or all of these. Wheat asks us to resurrect her jumbled phrase in our minds, contemplate it, and see if it is time for an insurrection.",

It is a literal reference to the hands on a clock and to progressive durations of time, with the length of each tape increasing as they go clockwise in a circle. The piece is also referencing art historical works such as Marcel Duchamp's painting Network of Stoppages (1914). But unlike in Duchamp's work, there are no \"stoppages\" here; rather, time is presented as a linear flow.",

In his project Instituto de visión (Vision Institute, 2008), consisting of twelve giclée prints, he looks at how Modernism gave rise to many new technological forms of vision, most notably the camera, and also resulted in the disappearance of outmoded forms of vision. As a metaphor for this process, Consuegra looks to the afterlife of the image as evidenced in signs. When a company goes out of business or moves, its sign often lingers and slowly fades a ghosted image. This exploration of the relics of visual experience questions what gains and losses came out of Modernism. ",

Rasgado wanders through the urban landscape in Mexico City and other major cities, looking for moments of intrigue in the dirt and debris. He captures these details by extracting materials from the sites and deploying them in the gallery. Raw materials thus become abstract paintings, which are both actively engaged with the site of their origin and politically and socially charged. Avenida Corona del Rosal (2011) is a section of wall extracted from the Mexico City street named in the title. It has been \"painted\" with an accumulation of byproducts of automobiles diesel soot, dirt, tire and brake particles to create an ironically poetic and beautiful portrait of the pollution that ravishes the city.",

His work includes sculpture, installation, photography, and mixed media, and shows subtle influences of prominent artists of the previous generation in South America specifically those who investigated modernity through an individual's mental and physical relationship to constructed space. His practice merges object design, the use of industrial and everyday materials, text, and images, seeking to explore both the internal and the external relationships objects have with the spaces around them. For instance in Relación interna 2 (2010), by measuring the space between two notebook pages with a half-cylinder of concrete a trademark modernist material Accinelli imbues the empty spaces among and between objects with an augmented depth.

Pak's projects usually start with a familiar but not necessarily acknowledged idea, then take it beyond a conceptual gesture without necessarily producing additional objects. Through repetition and anonymous intervention, the idea gradually starts to take form and infiltrates its surroundings, leaving subtle traces. Although never visually spectacular, Pak's projects reconfigure a personal system that involves bodily actions and effectively challenges the existing social logic and commodity-based culture.",

One of the nine parts of this work is Page 22 (Half Folded Library), a site-specific installation for which Pak covertly folded dog-ears on page 22 of every second book (a total of approximately 15,500 books) in the 58th Street Branch Library in Manhattan. By claiming it as a \"solo exhibition,\" Pak intentionally turned a public institution into a private and personal museum where his works are more or less a \"permanent collection.\" Being open-ended as far as further interpretation (or not) by readers who encounter the folded pages, the project tests the political and social potential of personal gestures in the public realm. It is also an ironic commentary on the increasingly self-estranged yet narcissistic art world.",

In homage to an influence in his early career, McCarthy attempted to reconstruct a pair of pants worn by Black Panther revolutionary Eldridge Cleaver in a picture that appeared in Rolling Stone magazine in the 1970s. But in the process, McCarthy misremembered their original design of the pants, which had black outer panels and white inner panels in white, and left a black shape highlighted in the crotch area. Instead, McCarthy's reconstruction divides the pants vertically in two black and white sections. McCarthy's mistake speaks not only of the fallibility of memory but of a certain kind of queerness that resists any categorical \"black or white\" definition. Memory Mistake's use of aesthetic formalism, error, subjectivity, and social history can be seen to challenge the tropes of modernism and art history.",

On his shoulders he supports an enormous false head, Mickey's familiar face grinning with glossy eyes. The artist has marked out in heavy black the background of Cinderella's castle. Robbed of his context, the character becomes the sole focus of the image, a subject of unusual scrutiny. Under this close examination, his torso and legs begin to seem strange too human for his extremities and his friendly wave starts to look less like that of a childhood hero and more like that of a politician. With McCarthy's intervention, the famous mouse is upstaged by his own artificiality. ",

This rather cliched visual trick recalls a funhouse mirror, or, perhaps more aligned with Cortright's frame of reference, a dream-sequence cue from after-school 90s television. ",

Following the steps of legendary artists such as Bas Jan Ader, some of Golia's works have taken the form of adventurous trips, like Going to Tirana (2000), in which he rowed across the Adriatic Sea, moving in the direction opposite from migrants trying to leave Albania.",

    "artist_description": "Zhang Qing is a conceptual artist living and working in Shanghai after graduating from the Changzhou Institute of Technology. Zhang's works deploy a variety of motifs and styles, at times dabbling in gender-bending photography and engaging in endurance-performances. Particularly, Zhang uses humor as an access point to expose the darker sides of capitalism in works such as Don't Go So Fast (2009), social commentary on the state of economic disparity among social classes. His recent video installation and mixed media works has developed a sophisticated videographic language, exemplified by CCTV(2011) to address issues of state media, surveillance and privacy. Zhang considers China's socio-political challenges to be unique to its own cultural-historical background and do not always translate or transfer well into foreign contexts. Thus, contemporary Chinese art can provide special visual entries into these complex socio-economic situations. ",

The game is furnished with complete uniforms, a referee, and a midfield line.  Initially, the game appears as a whimsical solution to urban ennui. Yet, as the players shuffle the ball around, recklessly knocking down items in the apartment, the viewer begins to wonder if the indoor game marks the increase of air pollution, and the erasure of green space by real estate development has forced all leisure activity to be conducted in the prison of one's apartment under surveillance.

After studying at the Sichuan Art Academy in Chongqing, China and graduating with emphases in contemporary international art and traditional Chinese culture from University of Kassel's College of Art in Germany, Qiu rose to international prominence in the 2006 Shanghai Biennial with a video work titled New Book of the Mountains and Seas. New Book of the Mountains and Seas is an animated ink work that appropriates the Book of the Mountains and Seas, a classical text mapping out the numinous geography of ancient China, to address the relationship between contemporary Chinese subjects and their natural environment through images of paradise and apocalypse.",

Each video depicts a portrait with features changing continuously and quickly into different persons, animals and symbols. Driven by the evolving contents of the screen itself, this piece showcases the form and material of Qiu's working method, which relies on precisely planned storyboard sketches drawn in pen on A4 paper. After the narrative is fully formed, Qiu transfers each image by painting it onto a small canvas with acrylic, which can be quickly wiped away to prepare for the subsequent image or element to be painted on top. Such process distills an aesthetics of over-painting that drives narrative development through changing logical relationships between material and form rather than plot elements. ",

Ghost I and Ghost II work as a pair to conjure reflection and its \"haunting\" quality. Other prints, such as Dyslexia, deploy similar letters of the alphabet b, d, q, p to create a different kind of confusion and disorientation. In This is print, embossed Braille dots communicate: \"This print is depicting another way a single idea can be communicated.\" Through the use of very simple mechanisms, humor, and tautology, Foster pushes our understanding of the relationship between signs, senses, meanings, and readings.",

For her source material she combs the digital world for bits of strange information that seep into our daily reality. These clues, be they coded sequences or simple phrases, become part of her puzzle; by reframing information she makes us reconsider it through a different lens. Language is embedded in Foster's work, but it is subject to play, often becoming obscured or reoriented. In Ghost I (2009) the word \"ghost\" becomes ghosted, rendered ominously in white chalk on black paper so that it resembles an apparition. Average Lifespan (2009) calculates the average lifespan of eight famous poets. This seemingly random equation reveals to us the age at which the poets died and forges a posthumous relationship among them. ",

    "description": "Untitled (Wall Street's Chosen Few...) is typical of Pettibon's drawings in which fragments of text and image are united, but yet gaps remain in their signification. A full story seems present but is not fully within the viewer's grasp. Here, Pettibon draws a connection between legal restrictions on free speech and the power of an elite on Wall Street. The drawing correlates market fears to the panic that results from a warning shouted in a crowded theater. Pettibon offers no resolution, only starbursts that resemble both the beauty of fireworks and suggest oncoming explosions.",

Within my current work, dance and simple movement scores act as a language for simultaneously collecting, mapping and producing volumes of information and knowledge. Moving makes a map and performing is observation. Digital mediations translate bodies into uncanny organisms and minimal dances become distant accumulations of pixelated information. Entanglements between human physicality, technology and natural systems are imagined through a playful aesthetics of information. As every last body and landscape is mapped and measured, through rigorous technologies of ever increasing distance, I look for the newly emerging territories that mineralize at the intersections of the virtual and the physical. These are the territories that we live in, archived in the memory drives of muscles, or through endlessly shifting choreographies of information.\"",

The photograph is framed upside down; these \"inverted trees\" follow Graham's early experiments with the camera lucida, a room-sized pinhole camera that dates back to ancient times and which he has used to photograph trees from various regions. Through these works Graham looks back at the history of photography while making the viewers aware of their own retinal experience. In the case of the Ponderosa Pine series, the artist's use of a pinewood frame gives the elephantine inverted tree both a physical presence and a rather morbid veil.",

In the series as a whole, Graham makes the case that identity is performed. Here, we see the artist behind a shop desk lined with early cameras and boxes of Kodak film. As the buttoned-up clerk scrawls a note, the ragged upper edge of the stage set is clearly visible above him. The scene's self-referential, transparent artifice insists that photography itself is also about performance, and that the medium's potential to generate vivid fictions might be more interesting than its historical role as a supposed conveyor of objective reality.

More ambitious in size and subject matter, this show with its complex video installation marked a new path for Terada's work. Voight-Kampf is based on a scene from Ridley Scott's 1982 movie Blade Runner in which a giant advertising billboard in the midst of a dystopian city of Los Angeles in the future displays a geisha eating candy. Terada used this image as a point of departure to explore issues of racial identity, the nature of photographic representation, and the liminal space between fiction and reality. In each of the three Maiko photographs that accompanied the exhibition, a Caucasian woman poses a Geisha and look directly at the camera. The images reinforce the staged and artificial nature of racial categories and stereotypes, but also speak to the excesses brought about by an accelerated consumer culture.",

More ambitious in size and subject matter, this show with its complex video installation marked a new path for Terada's work. Voight-Kampf is based on a scene from Ridley Scott's 1982 movie Blade Runner in which a giant advertising billboard in the midst of a dystopian city of Los Angeles in the future displays a geisha eating candy. Terada used this image as a point of departure to explore issues of racial identity, the nature of photographic representation, and the liminal space between fiction and reality. In each of the three Maiko photographs that accompanied the exhibition, a Caucasian woman poses a Geisha and look directly at the camera. The images reinforce the staged and artificial nature of racial categories and stereotypes, but also speak to the excesses brought about by an accelerated consumer culture.",

    "artist_description": "The influential, multi-disciplinary artist Roy Kiyooka worked as a painter, sculptor, teacher, poet, musician, filmmaker, and photographer. When Kiyooka arrived in Vancouver in 1959 he was already one of Canada's most respected abstract painters. His commitment to modernism at the time inspired a generation of Vancouver painters to reach beyond regionalism. In the 1960s and 1970s, Kiyooka began to write and publish poetry and produce photographic works. The best known of these, StoneDGloves, is both a poetic and photographic project. As Kiyooka began to reject the Greenbergian modernist aesthetic that informed his earlier paintings, he increasingly took up performance, photography, film, and music. He saw the position of the artist as being in opposition to the institutions of art. The shape of Kiyooka's work, especially his photographs, is only now being recognized.",

In this animation, layers of images, abstract forms, meaning, and metaphorical associations slowly unfold at the same time that more visual myths are created. The identity of the protagonist, a red-coated official, is indeterminate and suggestive of both the mercantilist policies that led to the Opium Wars with China and the cultural authority claimed by the Company school of painting over colonial India. Though situated in a particular historical context, The Last Post remains an open-ended narrative with infinite possible interpretations. The work's scope and complexity is expanded further by its sound element, which was created by Du Yun, an artist and composer based in New York City.",

Created over the period of a year, Lockhart's film and accompanying still photographs are intended as an exploration of the social spaces inside this kind of workplace. At the turn of the nineteenth century, the factory was an emblem for the American way of life; today, those same factories and an entire generation of the working class seem on the verge of disappearance as a result of political and economic global capitalism.",

Stanley \"Tom\" Durrell, Tinsmith (2008) belongs to a group of portrait-like photographs of the shipyard's workers lunchboxes. Created over the period of a year, Lockhart's film and accompanying still photographs are intended as an exploration of the social spaces inside this kind of workplace. At the turn of the nineteenth century, the factory was an emblem for the American way of life; today, those same factories and an entire generation of the working class seem on the verge of disappearance as a result of political and economic global capitalism.",

    "description": "The San Francisco based artist Shaun O'Dell often uses natural settings as subject matter, lending an artistic complexity to the landscapes he depicts. Stereoscopic images are dual, slightly offset identical pictures that, when seen through a special viewing device, appear three-dimensional. In Temple Creek, a branch of Escalante River, Aquarius Plateau Utah n.d. (Stereoscopic view) (2011) O'Dell has chopped each of the two side-by-side images into 10 vertical strips and mixed them up, to construct a new image. The reconfiguration lends the resulting piece a three-dimensional quality that hints at the artist's interest in creating new and intertwining realities, simultaneously natural and human-made.",

Whether abstract or figurative, they often read like hieroglyphics, in that they piece together a philosophical portrait of reality. Purple Brush 8 (2011) is a painting that details a meeting of geometric forms, and the optical play that results. The halves of two monochromatic sets of concentric squares meet in the center. The joining of two sides of the forms gives birth to a third image: a diamond shape that radiates outward from the canvas. The work is characteristic of O'Dell's oeuvre in that a simple gesture results in a much more complex proposition, drawing us deeper into a higher order. ",

    "artist_description": "Sriwhana Spong, who lives and works in Auckland, New Zealand, is interested in notions of transition, memory, and translation. Her works investigate the relationships between public and private, the intuitive and the cerebral, the body and its surroundings; often her artworks look at the meaningful dialogues and communications that different art forms \"in conversation\" can generate. She has a background in dance and choreography, and by manipulating sequences of gestures with the traditions and techniques of filmmaking, Spong investigates how dance movements can register particular events in our collective memories. For Spong, the medium of film is an anthropological tool of inquiry in the search for history, narratives, and constructions of time and space.",

    "description": "Inspired by the 1934 novella Duo by the French writer Colette, Spong's film Beach Study (2012) explores ideas of disappearance and the ephemeral, both physically and psychologically. In the film, a female body conducts abstract dance movements on a beach, responding to the environment that surrounds her. This particular beach was one the artist loved as a child, but today it is hardly accessible because it is in the hands of a private landowner. Shot on 16-millimeter film through colored filters, the film has intense flashes of magenta, violet, and amber, and other flickering \"light leak\" effects. The female body appears and disappears intermittently, creating a surreal and mysterious presence. The overall effect suggests a precarious relationship between memory and experience, transience and monumentality.",

Once the hub of industrial transportation, the station is now devoid of any human activity and lies fallow, surrounded by train-less tracks and vegetation-less ground. Douglas's preoccupation with obsolete sites like this seems less concerned with revisiting or memorializing them than in reviewing the conditions of their failure. ",

This visual seal refers to the disastrous aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 in which rescue workers spray painted the doors of the houses they searched giving the date, the team and the number of bodies found. Excerpt (Sealed) (Brown) is a multilayered collage with contradictory imagery from New Orleans debris to the American eagle and a theater curtain. This complex network of interwoven signs suggests the unstable and fictional nature of defining of race and class, and in any staging of historical and social narrative.",

Drawing on the ideas of thinkers like Karl Marx, Theodor Adorno, and Max Horkheimer, Sun investigates revolution, existence, mythologies of society, the notion of time, and the construction and narration of history. Often in a style of magical realism, Sun's works are full of metaphors and indirect visual associations that beg to be deciphered. He graduated from the print making department of the China Academy of Fine Art in 2005, and, a year later, established π Animation Studio. He has received several awards including the \"Chinese Contemporary Art Awards (CCAA Best Young Artist)\" and \"Taiwan Contemporary Art Link Young Art Award,\" both in 2010.",

Sun used this episode which was not fully recognized by the scientific community as a point of departure for his depiction of a dystopian world in which the narration of history and notion of time are interrupted. Because each frame was drawn by hand with crayon, it took Sun and his animation studio team a few years to complete this thirty-minute film of a surreal journey through mysterious cities, plagues of mosquitoes, broken statues, cawing ravens, waving flags, and flooded graveyards. Here, an ever-present man in a top hat makes obscure, cryptic references in scenarios that include the national anthem, factories belching soot into the threatening sky, and soaring planes dropping leaflets to earth. Rather than encouraging specific interpretations, 21 Ke is a visual commentary that asks essential questions of human existence: Who we are? What have we done? Where are we heading?",

The model is delicate, with detailed rendering of windows and a flagpole. Despite the negative association of black plastic trash bag, this work offers a sense of wonderment in it its scale and subject matter. The fragile, ephemeral make up of the castle contrasts the casual manner in which the bag is laid. This work was the inspired another \"castle work\" by Iwasaki, a contribution to Lustwarande '11, in which a copy of the Tilburg Castle produced from a transparent white produce bag was placed on the branch of a tree. The Tilburg Castle was reproduced from a drawing found on the Internet. The castle and its base appear to have magically manifested from what initially may have seem like an errant bag caught in the tree. ",

Taken by the camera itself with the help of an mirrored optical device, these images narrate and reflect the camera's own history and identity. As with most of Lee's work, this background information is not conveyed in any obvious way, but, instead, through allusions in titles and sleights of formal strategies. Cultural history, as Lee emphasizes, is not stable and fixed; it is in a state of perpetual flux, \"constantly shifting and changing, continually, repeatedly and endlessly.\"",

The side-by-side monitors (which are disorientingly out of sync) play a video of a close-up of Lee's head reciting Public Enemy lyrics. In a further spin, Lee's head is upside down and revolving counterclockwise on one screen and clockwise on the other like a pair of malfunctioning record turntables. In this, Lee is referencing Bruce Nauman's multichannel installation Anthro-Socio (1992), which features a man's head rotating as he calls out commands to the viewer. By resampling and conflating the works of these two artists, Lee momentarily conjoins conceptual video art and radical hip-hop, leading the viewer to search (perhaps in vain, perhaps not) for similarities between them.

Lee's film is spliced together from multiple takes of him actually rolling his way up a staircase. Sped up and played in reverse in a continuous loop, it is convincingly Keaton-esque in its slapstick humor. Lee completes the effect by mounting the 16-millimeter projector on a specially constructed stepped sculpture.",

She had a keen eye for architectural composition, and captured eloquent details using a delicate platinum print process. In 1929 she was deported from Mexico because of her involvement in the Communist party and went to Europe. Soon thereafter her work began to blend her eye for space and shape with a more critical social angle, often engaging in an overtly anti-Fascist discourses. Untitled (Cathedral) (ca. 1930), taken after her arrival in Europe, is an excellent example of her skillfully composed architectural pictures. It evokes ideas about how the composition of public spaces can influence both politics and cultural life. ",

Influenced by both journalism and archaeology, the London-based artist tries to minimize subjectivity in her work and keep her subjects as real and open as possible, leaving space for interpretation by the viewer. Often the sites she documents appears insignificant and nondescript, lacking any visual references that might trigger direct associations with historical events. Their lengthy titles, however, reveal the identities of the places by providing historical and political context. The haunted feeling generated by the emptiness of the locations evokes unsettled spirits of the past, and seems to invite a moment's reflection. ",

Yoneda focuses both on the original Japanese features of the houses and on details that have been altered since the end of the occupation. The yet-to-be acknowledged history of the occupation of Taiwan and other East Asian countries by Japan during World War II is subtly disclosed in these pictures. Instead of presenting monuments, the artist chooses to depict houses where the domestic lives of local Taiwanese are still unfolding today. The complexity of history is thus foregrounded by the overlapping of the everyday, the memory mixing with the remains. Former Residence of the Daughter of the Japanese Prime Minister, Kentaro Suzuki, Who Accepted the Potsdam Declaration and Full Surrender to the Allied Powers, Ending the Second World War, Qingtian Street, I depicts a dusty room with Japanese window frames but no views. Its title offers a biography of the original inhabitants and their historical role before the postwar Chinese Nationalist takeover. The wall behind the counter in Former House of General Wang Shu-ming, the Chief of Staff Under Chiang Kai-Shek, Cidong Street, I has been painted a deep red. The detailed title subtly suggests how local residents may have subsequently altered the home's original paint colors to be more \"Chinese.\"",

Influenced by an at once journalistic and archeological approach, Yoneda intends to minimize the subjectivity in her work and keeps her subject as real and open as possible, leaving space for interpretations by the viewers. Often appears to be insignificant, the sites documented in Yoneda's photos are non-descriptive, lacking any visual reference which would otherwise trigger direct associations of historical events; however the lengthy titles reveals the identities of the places by providing a historical and political context. The haunted feeling generated by the emptiness of locations evokes the unsettled spirits of the past, offering a moment for reflection. ",

Yoneda not only focuses on the original Japanese features of these houses but also the details that have been altered since the end of the occupation. Former Residence of the Daughter of Japanese Prime Minister, Kentaro Suzuki who Accepted the Potsdam Declaration and Full Surrender to the Allied Powers Ending the Second World War, Qingtian Street, I depicts a dusty room with Japanese window frames but no views. Its title offers a biography of the original inhabitants and their historical role before the postwar Chinese Nationalist takeover. The wall behind the counter in Former House of General Wang Shu-ming, the Chief of Staff under Chiang Kai-Shek, Cidong Street, I has been painted a deep red. The detailed title subtly suggests how later, local residents may have altered the home's original color to make it more \"Chinese.\" The yet-to-be acknowledged history of the occupation of Taiwian and other East Asian countries by Japan during World War II is subtly disclosed in Yoneda's images. Instead of presenting monuments, the artist chooses to depict these houses where the domestic lives of local Taiwanese are unfolding. The complexity of history is thus foregrounded by the overlapping of the everyday, the memory and the remains. ",

But it is actually the record of a particular phenomenon, an unbroken wave in deep water, which occurs before or after a storm. Instead of a passive image, it is a harbinger of, literally, a sea change. Donnelly has created several photographs of continuous waves over the past decade, and they punctuate her practice like omens. She makes drawings, photographs, sculptures, films, and sound pieces, and the medium of each one is always integral to its encrypted message. The barreling wave here seems to reference the longitudinal movement of a sound wave, perhaps evoking the transmission of audio frequencies to a distant audience. ",

His wallpaper prints usually feature beautiful floral patterns that recall the swirls of nineteenth-century decorative wallpapers. However, upon closer inspection, details reveal the patterns to be composed of text in both English and Chinese characters. Their provocative and sometimes offensive meanings mock art, the art market, the artist and his Chinese ethnicity, as well as other broader culture issues. In 2009, Tsang began experimenting with new media and produced The Seven Seals, an ongoing series of digital video installation works that takes its name from the New Testament's Book of Revelation. Tsang's practice allows a range of interpretations and encourages viewers to search the relationship between image and text, between pictographic and phonetic writing systems.",

Using texts and computer technology, the series draws its reference from various sources the Bible, Judeo-Christian eschatology, existentialism, metaphysics, politics, among others to articulate the world's complexity and the dilemmas that people face while approaching \"the end of the world.\" The Third Seal is a nineteen-by-twenty-seven-foot projection on a single wall that, together with sound, creates an immersive and dynamic environment. Crawling up from the bottom of the wall are black, worm-like texts that comment on class struggle, revolutionary riots, labor and production, human existence, and social justice. Without a clear beginning or end, the work suggests a cycle and the non-linear nature of history, and, by extension, life and death.",

Often posing philosophical inquiries in a humorous manner, Nguyen's activist works have addressed environmental degradation in Vietnam and often invoke themes drawn from Buddhist philosophy to reflect his namesake.

The single-channel video Waltz of the Machine Equestrians is a response to the overwhelming number of motorbikes and scooters overtaking the streets of Vietnam as small agrarian communities have been displaced by the construction of skyscrapers. The video shows 28 \"equestrians\" on motorbikes and scooters arrayed into a rainbow cavalcade held together by strings clipped onto brightly colored ponchos. Wearing helmets, face masks, and sun glasses, the riders attempt to shield themselves from the environment with armors sutured from cheap plastic material. They meander in a procession through a former scenic town near the Saigon River that has become the busy district of Thu Thiem. The precarious turns in the terse choreography is ushered by a soundtrack featuring Dmitri Shostakovich's histrionic Suite for Variety Orchestra, Waltz no. 2, in which trombones and cymbals echo the increased tensions between the individual and the collective. As the riders break free of each other in a grand finale, the sacrifice of spontaneity in maintaining the mechanical rhythm of such an interdependent enterprise is underscored in light of individual freedom.",

With copper wire stretched out across the room like a clothesline, Valeska Soares' La Ligne du Temps creates a timeline out of fluttering, old book pages. Read upon the pages of this delicately wrought installation are linguistic approaches to time and its phenomonologies. Stretched together, and made linear through their installation, these book titles make up a dysfunctional timeline, a poetic but impractical meditation on the way we measure out and experience days, weeks, and years.

Jarpa's project Minimal Secret includes reproductions of these pages, each heavily redacted, lined through with dark blocks of black. These pages, laser cut into acrylic, their darkened clots creating abstract geometric compositions, and point to our always partial, incomplete, and illiterate understanding of this political history an understanding which was and still is dictated by powers beyond our control.  ",

    "artist_description": "Wallace Berman was one of San Francisco's more important avant-garde artists and is considered by many to have been the father of the Californian assemblage movement (a title he could probably dispute with Edward Kienholz). Characteristically unruly, Berman was an active member of the San Francisco and Los Angeles Beat communities in the mid-1950s. In 1963 he settled in Topanga Canyon and started to develop the body of work for which he would become most famous. The verifax machine, a precursor of the photocopy machine, lent the name to the series of collages with which Berman experimented until his death in 1976. The structural compositional element that unifies the series is the image, appropriated from a magazine, of a hand holding a transistor radio. By photocopying and reproducing the image in sequential form on top of the canvas, Berman mimics the pattern produced by an old film reel. Inside the frame of each radio, the artist superimposed imagery people, objects and symbols, often taken from pop culture pertinent to that particular sequence of the work.",

Jones appropriated and edited, in a rapid sequence, a selection from the more than 68,000 censored or discarded films produced by the Farm Security Administration's photographers between 1935 and 1943. Roy Emerson Stryker, the then director of the program, was in charge of what he called \"killing\" negatives by punching holes in them to render them unusable. Killed continues Jones's use of discarded film footage seen in his video created from vintage 1970s and 1980s gay porn that was included in the 2008 Whitney Biennial. By recuperating lost and rather unseen pictures by emblematic American photographers such as Walker Evans, Theodor Jung, Carl Mydans, among others, Killed sheds a new light on the way American history has been written and the crucial role images have played in it.",

Seventy years later, when the United States military started opting for Humvees and stock parts, the company began to fail, and it entirely ceased production in 1999. Hercules Engines, Abandoned, Canton, Ohio (2011) depicts the manufacturer's former productive core, gone fallow. A sapling has grown up in the loading dock, and a view straight through the industrial interior shows a field on the other side. In this photograph, William E. Jones uses architectural photography as social documentary, personifying the industrial space to such a degree that it becomes metonymic of a once-powerful industry past its prime.",

The reds, pinks, and oranges of the buildings give off warmth, but the absence of human activity makes the glow eerie and strange. Once a booming steel town, Canton is now struggling, and many of its buildings have been neglected for decades. While the location of William E. Jones's photograph is specific, we can't help extrapolating to imagine any Main Street, USA, that has been left to atrophy in the wake of big industry gone bust.",

Through digital photomontage, he superimposed an identical elephant in front of four different iconic landmarks: Parangtritis Beach, Sultan Square, the City Monument, and Mount Merapi. These four locations are spiritual symbols and the subject of local cosmological beliefs, and the elephant has long been a cultural and religious icon. But there is something obviously strange about the images. Not only is the elephant proportionally unbalanced and out of place, but it is also upended and tied to a whimsical structure comprised of bamboo posts, wheels, and wood slabs. There is paradox created in the image by the juxtaposition of the immobile and sacrificed elephants and the symbolic sites creating a surreal and absurd effect.",

Her works recall 1960s conceptual pieces that question the process of art making, authorship and the definition of art as a unique original objects. Wong's works call into question the role of art in contemporary economic structure and the arbitrary value given to works of art. This focus on the commodity also explores notions of quality, utility and value while challenging the beliefs generated about Hong Kong's favorite middle-class pastime, shopping. Particularly, Wong makes her point through transforming mundane ephemera, such as things left in wallets or handbags, the everyday bits and pieces picked up from supermarkets into hand-crafted works.

    "description": "Tribute to Inside Looking Out--for the male artists along my way is a video work commenting on Inside Looking Out, an exhibition staged at Osage Beijing. The show comprised of six male artists who were friends of Wong's during art school. Wong joined them in Beijing to set up for their show and opening, where she was introduced as the artist's girlfriend, without any mention of her name. As a reflection on this incident as \"the only time Wong thought about Feminism Art,\" Tribute to Inside Looking Out shows an anonymous woman, Wong with her face obscured from the camera, hitting the artists of the show one by one with a folding stool, perhaps as punishment for the abovementioned sexist presentation. The willing submission of the male artists to the humorous yet violent act creates an ambiguous relationship between the power dynamics between male and female artists. The video ends with voices of men singing in unison Faye Wong's \"Easily Hurt Woman\" (originally by Miyuki Nakajima) as if in an upbeat Cantopop military march. This ironic gesture, once again, reinforces through subversion the asymmetrical power dynamic demarcating artists of different genders and points to the changing meaning of a work's content when performed by different genders.",

The video located in an imagined contemporary Malaysian middle-class living room, a space of a fictive former imperial power explores the precarious link between fact and fiction, fakery and authenticity by overlaying three believable, authoritative forms: a documentary, a website, and a realistic reconstruction of a contemporary home. It is rife with occidental colonial documents and exotic cultural artifacts the trophy-evidence of Empire-making. The video parodies television networks and documentaries as researched authoritative forms of information. It begins by posing as a serious, believable work of non-fiction, but becomes increasingly unsettling with its inclusion of fictive events, memories, and histories around the urgent contemporary problems of migration, racism, power relationships, and empire making.",

With the increasingly hegemonic domination of the media industry in everyday life, its systems of representation have become a central issue in Wong's recent work, which oscillates between reality and fiction, irony and transgression and gains a new strength in the process.",

Someone uploaded on a sextape of pop star Ariel Peterpan with model-actress Luna Maya recorded on a mobile phone. Several days later, another video of Ariel Peterpan and Cut Tari, an infotainment news presenter in Indonesia, surfaced on the Internet. This second video taken using a mobile phone in vertical frame but transferred to a computer in default horizontal format. Vertical Horizon zones in on the way viewers unconsciously turn their head horizontally to watch the sensational videos to examine the way mobile phones have changed our lives. The work takes a critical look at both the content of celebrity in contemporary global media and the apparatus supporting this voyeuristic communication. ",

Later, a human voice murmuring in low, deep tones provides a soundtrack to the visual ambiguity to produce and effect between something derivative of Plato's \"Allegory of the Cave\" and a mockery of human desire and struggle.  The video ends with an epigram added by Chen: \"You cannot, could not, be in the dark, about all the darkness\", an ominous warning of play on words seemingly urges the viewer to approach the incoherent narrative as a layered incantation of play on shadows.",

Okón focuses on Ciudad Juárez as a site for many \"maquiladoras\" factories  and on its role within the global context. Canned Laughter is a detailed construction of Bergson, a fictitious factory that produces canned laughter for sitcoms. For it, dozens of ex-maquiladora workers were hired both as part of the research process (maquiladoras are highly secretive and it is very hard to know what happens inside) and as actors. Canned Laughter alludes to mechanized processes and to slavery in the age of globalization as well as to the impossibility to translate and reproduce true emotions though technological means.",

Each of the large works comprise of moving images overlaid with giant text, all synched to a stealthy, up-tempo jazz soundtrack. In The Secret Life of Harumi, a Japanese woman fantasizes escaping her job and living a temporary dream life in San Francisco. Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries (YHCHI) uses locally sourced virtual products such as Adobe Flash animation and Apple's Monaco or Menlo typeface to create a whimsical and indirect commentary on the psychology of the working class in an information society within postindustrial imperialism. For two months, YHCHI inhabited the economically polarized South of Market neighborhood, where a variety of socioeconomic realities overlap and coexist, from Facebook employees to the homeless. The Flash animation is influenced by realist cinema and depicts the tediousness in commuting by air and ground combined with the kitsch of an \"Asia-town\" window display. Overlaid with text-like femslash prose in a semi-coherent style of karaoke lyrics, the sensory cacophony disrupts a viewer's thoughts and alludes to a desensitized boredom mixed with the desires of the alternative persona of a fictional Japanese woman.",

In this play of mirrors, the viewer first encounters his reflection, but in time the vibration distorts the image, making self-recognition impossible and suggesting the fragility of identity. Flutter's reflective surfaces also evoke the architecture of office buildings that shake just so in an earthquake. ",

Zhao portrays human as figures curious about their natural environment, which is at times mysterious and unpredictable. Through observing human behavior in front of animals rather than that of the animals themselves, Zhao's critical lens examines various modes of what he calls a \"zoological gaze,\" the manner through which humans view animals and nature. His works create visual ambiguity so the viewer becomes aware of assumptions made about the way images present facts. Zhao received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in photography at Caberwell College of Arts and a Masters degree at the London College of Communication, where he graduated with distinction.",

Recent media attention on global warming and climate change has driven interest in increased glacial activity. The group spends long period of each year in the harsh Arctic environment to acquire in-depth knowledge of these changes while experiencing the landscape firsthand. Expedition #46 presents voyeuristic images of human activity in expansive surreal glacial landscapes to elicit a sense of discovery in the viewer, who travels by-proxy via Zhao's photographic series. The viewer is able to observe the Study Group's journey in observing their environment and engage in critical reflection of the varying documentary spectatorship deployed in the visual discourse of environmentalism and scientific research.
