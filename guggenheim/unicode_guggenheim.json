    "description": "\nDescription\nThe woman holding the parrot is PierreAuguste Renoirs friend Lise Trehot (18481922), whose pretty, youthful features are recognizable in other canvases the artist painted between 1867 and 1872. He probably executed this picture soon after his return from service in the Franco-Prussian War in March 1871 and certainly before Lise married someone else in April 1872, evidently never to see Renoir again. The black silk dress with white cuffs and red sash accentuate Lises dark hair and pale skin; the dark green walls and plants suggest a rather heavy and formal interior decorated in the Second Empire style.According to art historian Colin B. Bailey, In genre painting of the 1860s and 1870s, such richly dressed young women were generally assumed to be kept womenthe lorette, or high-class courtesan, was a social type created during the Second Empireand the erotic Symbolism of the parrot and the gilded bird cage would have been obvious. . . . Yet Renoirs presentation of this lascivious subject is actually rather well-mannered. He avoids anecdote and innuendo, refuses to pander to the prurient beholder, and in doing so acknowledges his debt to Manet.1The subject of a woman holding a parrot appears in works from the 1860s by Gustave Courbet, Edgar Degas, and Edouard Manet. The formal, static composition and the representation of spatial depth and traditional modeling in Renoirs painting are consistent with his pictures from the late 1860s and early 1870s. Woman with Parrot clearly predates Renoirs Impressionist style and does not yet reflect the high-keyed tonality, shimmering patterns of light and spontaneity of mood that would characterize his later work.1.

The artist provoked a similar scandal when his painting Nana (1877)depicting a coquettish young woman in a state of partial undress powdering her nose in front of an impatient clientwas exhibited in a shop window on the boulevard des Capucines. Manets attention to a motif conventionally associated with pornography reflected his desire to render on canvas the truths of modern life.

His work was motivated by a desire to give sculptural weight and volume to the instantaneity of vision achieved by the Impressionists, who painted from nature. Relying on his perception of objects in space as visually interrelated entitiesas forms locked into a greater compositional structureCezanne developed a style premised on the oscillation of surface and depth. Each tiny dab of color, as demonstrated on the mottled apples in Still Life: Flask, Glass, and Jug, indicates a spatial shift while simultaneously calling attention to the two-dimensional canvas on which it rests. This play of illusion, along with the conceptual fusion of time and space, has led Cezanne to be considered the foremost precursor of Cubism.The artists late work, created in relative isolation in the south of France, is marked by an intensification of his perceptual analysis coupled with an increasingly introspective sensibility. In Man with Crossed Arms, the strangely distorted, proto-Cubist view of the sitterhis right eye is depicted as if glimpsed from below and the left as if seen from abovecontributes an enigmatic, contemplative air to the painting. This portrait of an anonymous sitter has come to be seen as a psychological study of quiet resignation and reservecharacteristics often attributed to Cezanne during the last decade of his life.The artists obsession with the nuances of spatial construction and optical effect is evinced in the numerous landscapes painted during this late period. In the abandoned and overgrown quarries known as Bibemus, east of the town of Aix-en-Provence, Cezanne discovered a rough, partially man-made, and intensely chromatic landscape that suited his geometrizing style. Between 1895 and 1899 he proceeded to visually explore the geographic and tonal variations that occurred in this remote, deserted area. In the Guggenheims canvas, Cezannes restless strokes and intermittent patches of complementary colors form passages of flatness and volume that create at once a diaphanous surface pattern and an illusion of great depth. The artists unique sensations of the terrain are manifest in this picture as a radiant tapestry that heralds the imminent advent of abstract painting.Nancy Spector\r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nGeorges Seurat's vibrant and harmonious images, comprising distinct daubs of complementary color, revolutionized painting. Born in Paris, Seurat entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in 1878. He rapidly elaborated a personal idiom fed by 19th-century scientific theories of chromatics, optics, and physiological perception espoused by such thinkers as Michel-Eugene Chevreul, Ogden Rood, and Charles Henry, respectively. In 1881, he began a series of rural studies to which the Guggenheim's paintings appertain. He was largely inspired by the peasant imagery of Barbizon painter Jean-Francois Millet, and his crosshatched brushstrokes in these small works of agrarian life belie his incipient experiments with the division of color. A master draftsman, he created contemporaneous conte crayon drawings that capitalize on the textured surface of the paper to create zones of light and dark in eerily evocative images, as with the twilit Place de la Concorde, Winter. Seurat's investigations led to a more developed exploitation of contrasting color in 1884 with his transitional Bathers at Asnieres. He eventually called his technique chromoluminarism, because the juxtaposition of individual hues elicited greater light effects, while contemporary critics christened it Pointillism or Neo-Impressionism.In 1886, at the eighth and last Impressionist exhibition, Seurat and a circle of like-minded painters jolted the art world with their radical works. The centerpiece was A Sunday on La Grande Jatte1884 (188486), Seurat's epic painting of Parisians captured in a moment of leisure-time consumption along the banks of the Seine. The subjects Seurat portrayed in his other major images of metropolitan lifestreet musicians, circus performers, can-can dancers, and modelsequally epitomize modernity. While rural and urban social themes are an attendant aspect of his work (although he never overtly voiced the leftist political ideals shared by most of the Neo-Impressionists), from the mid-1880s onward, Seurat also painted port scenes and seascapes along the northern coastline of France. These luminous works devoid of people, which combine mosaic-like surfaces with arabesque forms, are meant to induce emotive states in the viewer through particular deployments of color, chromatic intensity, and line, transcending the potentially formulaic confines of a method founded in scientific process. Such ideas were influential for his contemporaries, as well as the Symbolist painters of the 1890s. Yet, because Seurat was notoriously reticent and wrote little about his theories, when his life was cut short by diphtheria at age 31, these hermetic works became his singular legacy.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn September 1859 Paul Cezannes father bought a large country house and farm, called the Jas de Bouffan, just outside Aix-en-Provence. For the next forty years, this estate, which included a large 18th-century house, alleys of chestnut trees, and views of Mont Sainte-Victoire (another of the artists favorite sites), afforded Cezanne with many of his subjects. No fewer than thirty-seven oils and sixteen watercolors of the Jas de Bouffan and its immediate environment have been catalogued, but it was only in the mid- and late 1880s that Cezanne explored the varied motifs offered by the manor and its grounds in real depth, as in paintings such as The Neighborhood of Jas de Bouffan. The work has a traditional design, with a large foreground tree at one side and a clump of smaller trees at the other framing a distant view in the center; but in Cezannes scrupulous adaptation, it becomes an image of a particular place beyond the walls of his family estate, seen in the warm light of Provence on a cloudless summer day.Both the sense of order and the sense of isolation that emanate from this balanced yet uninhabited landscape convey what must have been the artists dominant mood in the summer of 1887 or 1888calm but resigned, with his frustrated affair of 1885 as well as his loveless marriage, the death of his domineering father, and his break with his boyhood friend Emile Zola in 1886 all now behind him. He summed up this mood of resignation, coupled with a deep immersion in nature, in a letter to the collector Victor Chocquet written in May 1886: I should have wished to possess the intellectual equilibrium that characterizes you. . . . Fate has not endowed me with an equal stability, that is the only regret I have about the things of this earth. As for the rest, I have nothing to complain about. Always the sky, the boundless things of nature, attract me and give me the chance to look with pleasure. And continuing in a vein that seems still more appropriate to The Neighborhood of Jas de Bouffan, he adopted an allegorical style: I had a few vineyards, but unexpected frosts came and cut the thread of hope. And my wish would have been, on the contrary, to see them grow well; and so I can only wish you success for your plantations and a good development of your vegetation; green being one of the gayest colors which does the most good to the eyes. 1That Cezanne too could achieve such a development, if not in life, at least in art, is evident from The Neighborhood of Jas de Bouffan, in which the vibrant color harmony is dominated by a rich variety of greens, modulating in one sense toward yellow and ocher, in the other toward blue and violet, in a manner at once descriptive and abstract that does indeed do the most good to the eyes.T.R.1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nWhile living in Paris, Vincent van Gogh made frequent excursions to the suburb of Asnieres to escape the urban environment and paint in nature before his subject, a method he often advocated to other artists. On these trips he would usually stay at the family home of Bernard, a young painter he advised. In a letter to Bernard from Arles, Van Gogh reiterated his position on the importance of painting from experience rather than from the imagination: I am getting well acquainted with nature. I exaggerate, sometimes I make changes in a motif; but for all that, I do not invent the whole picture; on the contrary, I find it all ready in nature, only it must be disentangled.1 On a late summer day in 1887, the artist set out to record one of the many now-extinct poternes, or underpass and tollhouse structures, that ringed Paris and regulated entry into the city. For Roadway with Underpass (Le viaduc), Van Gogh chose the vantage point of a traveler en route from Asnieres, which is suggested by a dim glow at the end of the tunnel. The lone figure clad in black walking into the darkness midway in the tunnel lends a vague air of foreboding.\nVan Gogh painted this scene at the beginning of his mature period when he was exploring the technical achievements of the various stylistic idioms current in Paris. The contrasting creamy ocher impasto and chalky blue shadows on the crumbling underpass and the road suggest the heightened palette and divided brushstroke of the Impressionists. Moreover the contrasting complementary colors he employs in the energetic dots and loose dashes that imply the movement of the foliage animated by the breeze on the embankment attest to his hesitant investigations of Divisionist color theory. Roadway with Underpass foreshadows two paintings with similar compositions that Van Gogh would paint in Arles in 1888: The Trinquetaille Bridge (Le pont de Trinquetaille) and The Railroad Bridge (Le pont de Languelois). Like the present painting, these two works present a view through a tunnel from the perspective of a spectator situated diagonally to the right of the bridge; however, the more complex later canvases also include a counterthrusting pathway leading to the left.Jennifer Blessing1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nDisillusioned with Parisian artists cafe society and the oppressive gloom of the urban winter, Vincent van Gogh left Paris in mid-February 1888 to find rejuvenation in the healthy atmosphere of sun-drenched Arles. When he stepped off the train in the southern city, however, he was confronted by a snowy landscape, the result of a record cold spell. Undaunted, Van Gogh painted Landscape with Snow around February 24, when the snow had mostly melted, just prior to a new inundation.1 The artist implies the patchy coverage of the snow through daubs of brown paint and by leaving areas of the canvas to the brilliant illumination and feverish colors of the summer harvest paintings Van Gogh made later in the year. Here, instead, he presents the looming, purplish light of an impending snowstorm.A great admirer of Japanese art, Van Gogh went to Arles hoping to establish an artistic community in an environment commensurate with his Oriental ideal. He wrote to his brother, Theo, from Arles, But for my part I foresee that other artists will want to see color under a stronger sun, and in a more Japanese clarity of light.2 This painting may have been inspired by the snowy scenes common to the Japanese prints Van Gogh avidly collected, but it also follows conventions of seventeenth-century Dutch landscape painting in its gradation of color from dark greens and browns framing the foreground to blue sky in the distance, and through the diagonal recession of the road in the snowy landscape. But, unlike Dutch panoramas with their broad expanse of sky, the present work shows Van Gogh concentrating on the terrain between where he stands and the bright red-roofed cottage in the distance. He paints the scene from a perspective immersed in the landscape, on the same plane as the black-hatted man and bowlegged dog trudging along the path.This canvas and a similar one painted a day or so later, Snowy Landscape with Arles in the Background (private collection, London), are less detailed than the more elaborate and descriptive landscapes Van Gogh made a few months later, thus suggesting the artists tentative approach to his recently chosen home.Jennifer Blessing1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn February 1888 Vincent van Gogh left Paris for Arles, in the Provence region of southern France, where he hoped to start an artists colony. During that summer he painted a number of portraits of locals who posed for him, including a member of the Zouave, a French infantry unit originally composed of Algerian soldiers. At the end of July and beginning of August, he created some of his most accomplished drawings, renditions of paintings he had recently made. In The Zouave, he carefully translated the expressiveness of his striking color combinations and bold brushstrokes through the variety and density of contrasting marks, including dots, striations, and intense crosshatching.Eager for his friend Paul Gauguin to join him in Arles, Van Gogh sent this drawing and several others to the artist John Peter Russell, ostensibly as a pretext to ask Russell to buy a Gauguin painting. Though this never happened, Gauguin arrived in Arles in October; subsequently Van Gogh became progressively more agitated, resulting in a breakdown and Gauguins departure in December. In the years prior to his suicide in 1890, Van Gogh suffered increasingly frequent attacks of mental distress, the cause of which remains unclear. Mountains at Saint-Remy (Montagnes a Saint-Remy) was painted in July 1889, when he was trying to recuperate at the hospital of Saint-Paulde-Mausole in the town of Saint-Remy, not far from Arles. The painting represents the Alpilles, a low range of mountains visible from the hospital grounds. In it, he activated the terrain and sky with the heavy impasto and forceful, broad brushstrokes characteristic of his late work.Van Gogh advocated painting from nature rather than inventing a motif from the imagination. On a personal level, he felt that painting outdoors would help to restore his health, a sentiment he often voiced when writing to his brother. He mentioned this painting several times in his letters, relating it to a passage from Edouard Rods Le sens de la vie (The direction of life, 1889). In one note he wrote, I rather like the Entrance to a QuarryI was doing it when I felt this attack coming onbecause to my mind the somber greens go well with the ocher tones; there is something sad in it which is healthy, and that is why it does not bore me. Perhaps that is true of the Mountain too. They will tell me that mountains are not like that and that there are black outlines of a fingers width. But after all it seemed to me it expressed the passage in Rods book . . . about a desolate country of somber mountains, among which are some dark goatherds huts where sunflowers are blooming.Jennifer Blessing\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nDuring the years preceding his suicide in 1890, Vincent van Gogh suffered increasingly frequent attacks of mental distress, the cause of which remains unclear. Mountains at Saint-Remy was painted in July 1889, when Van Gogh was recovering from just such an episode at the hospital of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole in the southern French town of Saint-Remy. The painting represents the Alpilles, a low range of mountains visible from the hospital grounds. In it, Van Gogh activated the terrain and sky with the heavy impasto and bold, broad brushstrokes characteristic of his late work.Van Gogh advocated painting from nature rather than inventing a motif from the imagination. On a personal level, he felt that painting outdoors would help to restore his health, a sentiment he often voiced when writing to his brother, Theo. He mentioned this painting several times in his letters, relating it to a passage from Edouard Rods Le Sens de la vie. In one note he wrote, I rather like the Entrance to a QuarryI was doing it when I felt this attack coming onbecause to my mind the somber greens go well with the ocher tones; there is something sad in it which is healthy, and that is why it does not bore me. Perhaps that is true of the Mountain too. They will tell me that mountains are not like that and that there are black outlines of a fingers width. But after all it seemed to me it expressed the passage in Rods book . . . about a desolate country of somber mountains, among which are some dark goatherds huts where sunflowers are blooming.Nature had a quasi-religious or transcendental significance for Van Gogh. Unlike the earlier Impressionists, who often painted urban life, the artist felt that the city, in particular Paris, was a place of iniquity, inherently unhealthful. In the face of industrialization and modernization (the Eiffel Tower was built the same year that this canvas was painted), Van Gogh longed nostalgically for a rural environment peopled with good-natured, God-fearing peasants such as those painted by Jean-Francois Millet, one of his heroes. This utopian ideal, based on a belief in the regenerative capacity of a primitive culture, was shared by Van Goghs friend Paul Gauguin, who sought redemption farther from home, among the people of Tahiti.Jennifer Blessing\n",

Gauguins desire to reject Western culture and merge with a naive society for the sake of aesthetic and spiritual inspiration reflects the complex and problematic nature of European Primitivism. A concept that emerged at the end of the 19th century, primitivism was motivated by the romantic desire to discover an unsullied paradise hidden within the uncivilized world, as well as by a fascination with what was perceived as the raw, unmediated sensuality of cultural artifacts.

Both canvases probably depict the area surrounding Mataiea, the small village in which Gauguin settled during the fall of 1891. As richly hued tapestries of flattened forms, they are, however, only evocations of the lush Tahitian terrain, reflecting the simplicity of form sought by the artist during his first visit to the island. Gauguin derived the pose of the man and horse in In the Vanilla Grove not from a scene he found in Tahiti but from a frieze on the quintessential monument of Western culture, the Parthenon. Gauguin painted the phrase Haere Mai, which means Come here! in Tahitian, onto the other canvas in the lower-right corner, but it does not appear to coincide with the content of the painting. The artist, who spoke little of the native language at that time, often combined disparate Tahitian phrases with images in an effort to evoke the foreign and the mystical. Evidently, this practice was designed to make the paintings more enticing to the Parisian public, who craved intimations of the distant and the exotic.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nHenri Rousseau endured the art-historical misfortune of being a working-class late bloomerhe was a Sunday painter who only began to paint seriously in his 40swith what seemed to his critics little natural talent. His unsentimental, haunting images nonetheless drew the attention of a literary and artistic coterie hungry for fresh recruits. How did Rousseau, whose style still commands belittling adjectives such as naive and simple, escape relegation to the margins of art history? It was, as the writer Andre Malraux has pointed out, the former toll clerks friendship with a legion of well-established masters that has by and large guaranteed his place in the history of modern art. During his lifetime Rousseau became something of a sensation within the relatively small Parisian art scene. His astonishing works were celebrated by Guillaume Apollinaire, Alfred Jarry, and Pablo Picasso, and he came to be considered a major force by artists such as Max Beckmann, Vasily Kandinsky, and Fernand Leger only a few years after his paupers death.To the extent that he had limited official success while he lived, Rousseau can be said to have invented himselfhe barged uninvited into exhibitions and dinner parties alike, assuming the posture of an honored guestjust as he invented images unlike anything around him. Canvases such as Artillerymen and The Football Players have been interpreted as Rousseaus quirky attempts to depict modern times, whether with a dapper military company as in the former example, or with the four natty enthusiasts of a new sport, rugby, in the latter. It is to his credit that we still have no adequate words to describe a painting in which rugby players look like pajama-clad twins, or one in which 14 identical handlebar mustaches succeed in delivering a spirited image of an artillery battery.Cornelia Lauf\r\n        ",

His work was motivated by a desire to give sculptural weight and volume to the instantaneity of vision achieved by the Impressionists, who painted from nature. Relying on his perception of objects in space as visually interrelated entitiesas forms locked into a greater compositional structureCezanne developed a style premised on the oscillation of surface and depth. Each tiny dab of color, as demonstrated on the mottled apples in Still Life: Flask, Glass, and Jug, indicates a spatial shift while simultaneously calling attention to the two-dimensional canvas on which it rests. This play of illusion, along with the conceptual fusion of time and space, has led Cezanne to be considered the foremost precursor of Cubism.The artists late work, created in relative isolation in the south of France, is marked by an intensification of his perceptual analysis coupled with an increasingly introspective sensibility. In Man with Crossed Arms, the strangely distorted, proto-Cubist view of the sitterhis right eye is depicted as if glimpsed from below and the left as if seen from abovecontributes an enigmatic, contemplative air to the painting. This portrait of an anonymous sitter has come to be seen as a psychological study of quiet resignation and reservecharacteristics often attributed to Cezanne during the last decade of his life.The artists obsession with the nuances of spatial construction and optical effect is evinced in the numerous landscapes painted during this late period. In the abandoned and overgrown quarries known as Bibemus, east of the town of Aix-en-Provence, Cezanne discovered a rough, partially man-made, and intensely chromatic landscape that suited his geometrizing style. Between 1895 and 1899 he proceeded to visually explore the geographic and tonal variations that occurred in this remote, deserted area. In the Guggenheims canvas, Cezannes restless strokes and intermittent patches of complementary colors form passages of flatness and volume that create at once a diaphanous surface pattern and an illusion of great depth. The artists unique sensations of the terrain are manifest in this picture as a radiant tapestry that heralds the imminent advent of abstract painting.Nancy Spector\r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nPaul Cezannes shimmering landscapes, searching portraits, and complex still lifes may be viewed as the culmination of Impressionisms quest for empirical truth in painting. His work was motivated by a desire to give sculptural weight and volume to the instantaneity of vision achieved by the Impressionists, who painted from nature. Relying on his perception of objects in space as visually interrelated entitiesas forms locked into a greater compositional structureCezanne developed a style premised on the oscillation of surface and depth. Each tiny dab of color, as demonstrated on the mottled apples in Still Life: Flask, Glass, and Jug, indicates a spatial shift while simultaneously calling attention to the two-dimensional canvas on which it rests. This play of illusion, along with the conceptual fusion of time and space, has led Cezanne to be considered the foremost precursor of Cubism.The artists late work, created in relative isolation in the south of France, is marked by an intensification of his perceptual analysis coupled with an increasingly introspective sensibility. In Man with Crossed Arms, the strangely distorted, proto-Cubist view of the sitterhis right eye is depicted as if glimpsed from below and the left as if seen from abovecontributes an enigmatic, contemplative air to the painting. This portrait of an anonymous sitter has come to be seen as a psychological study of quiet resignation and reservecharacteristics often attributed to Cezanne during the last decade of his life.The artists obsession with the nuances of spatial construction and optical effect is evinced in the numerous landscapes painted during this late period. In the abandoned and overgrown quarries known as Bibemus, east of the town of Aix-en-Provence, Cezanne discovered a rough, partially man-made, and intensely chromatic landscape that suited his geometrizing style. Between 1895 and 1899 he proceeded to visually explore the geographic and tonal variations that occurred in this remote, deserted area. In the Guggenheims canvas, Cezannes restless strokes and intermittent patches of complementary colors form passages of flatness and volume that create at once a diaphanous surface pattern and an illusion of great depth. The artists unique sensations of the terrain are manifest in this picture as a radiant tapestry that heralds the imminent advent of abstract painting.Nancy Spector\r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nPablo Picasso was still living in Barcelona when the 1900 Worlds Fair drew him to Paris for the first time. During the course of his two-month stay he immersed himself in art galleries as well as the bohemian cafes, night-clubs, and dance halls of Montmartre. Le Moulin de la Galette, his first Parisian painting, reflects his fascination with the lusty decadence and gaudy glamour of the famous dance hall, where bourgeois patrons and prostitutes rubbed shoulders. Picasso had yet to develop a unique style, but Le Moulin de la Galette is nonetheless a startling production for an artist who had just turned 19.Parisian night life, teeming with uninhibited hedonism and vulgarity, was a popular theme in late-19th- and early 20th-century painting; artists such as Edgar Degas and Edouard Manet documented this enticing, ribald nocturnal realm. None was a more skilled chronicler or sympathetic observer of the demimonde than Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, whose numerous paintings and graphics from the late 1880s and early 1890s of pleasure palaces and their roguish patrons were an early and important influence on Picasso. Reproductions of his expressive paintings appeared in French newspapers that circulated in Barcelona and were well known to Picasso before he came to Paris, but the firsthand experience of these canvases and the decadent culture they portrayed increased his admiration for Toulouse-Lautrec and the tradition in which they were painted. In Le Moulin de la Galette, Picasso adopted the position of a sympathetic and intrigued observer of the spectacle of entertainment, suggesting its provocative appeal and artificiality. In richly vibrant colors, much brighter than any he had previously used, he captured the intoxicating scene as a dizzying blur of fashionable figures with expressionless faces.Jan Avgikos\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nExcept for its relatively small size, The Fourteenth of July (Le quatorze juillet) is an ideal counterpart to Le Moulin de la Galette (autumn 1900) and illustrates the extremes of style, mood, and traditions that leavened Pablo Picassos imagination during his heady early years, roughly 1900 to 1907, in Paris. The space created in Le Moulin de la Galette draws us forward; in The Fourteenth of July all seems to hurtle toward us. In the earlier painting, color is contained within clearly outlined and relatively small areas; here it explodes as freely as the firecrackers set off by the festive crowd. But the composition, far from being cheerfully scattered, is masterfully disciplined. The figures streaming toward us at the lower left are counterbalanced by the wedge-shaped crowd on the right and the steady beat of the stepped rooflines in back. Picasso emphasizes the counterpoint of the two groups by making nearly all the figures on the right blend into a blur of colors (primarily red and blue) while the figures on the left are treated with far more individuality. Many of the faces on the left are limned with heavy black outlines, and those in the foreground have recognizable features and even a certain level of expression. The man in a white shirt with his chin supported on his fist makes a sullen impression similar in mood (and in technique as well) to Honore Daumiers The Third-Class Carriage (Le wagon de troisieme classe, ca. 186264). Throughout the group of the left, Picasso has highlighted the red and blue with contrasting patches of white, yellow, green, pink, and pale blue. This relatively modest painting encompasses both the general cheer of official holidays as well as the mournful exceptions that are the inevitable concomitant of public festivals. Like Edouard Manet in his The Rue Mosnier with Flags (La rue Mosnier avec drapeaux, 1878), which also depicts a national celebration, Picasso adds a throb of melancholy amid the gay celebrations. \nFred Licht\n",

Degas was from a privileged background, born of a well-to-do family in Paris. After studying law briefly, he turned to art in 1855, attending the Ecole des Beaux-Arts for a time. While he became associated with the Impressionists, Degas belonged to a slightly older generation of artists, which is apparent in the naturalist style of his early portraits and interiors. But, his quintessential works date from the Impressionist decades of the 1870s and 1880s. Like his cohorts, he cast his gaze upon Pariss electrifying society of spectacle, painting scenes of the cafe-concert, the opera, and the races. He also looked to those living on the fringes of this world: alienated people drinking absinthe, laundresses, milliners, and prostitutes. Perhaps, most recognizable are his ballerinas, seen in dance classes, at rest, rehearsing, and performing.Degass formal investigations, however, remained paramount, and his subjects, who often seem caught unaware from unusual angles in awkward poses, are vehicles for these explorations. Blurred action and the dramatic cropping of figures or forms reveal conventions adopted from photography (which he also practiced), signaling the instantaneity that the Impressionists embraced. The cropping, together with his incongruous compositional constructions, was also influenced by the nonillusionistic treatment of space and form of Japanese prints, which had gained popularity in France during the 1860s.In the mid-1880s, his vision began to fail and the more forgiving medium of pastel became increasingly important to Degas, who fully exploited its soft, blurred contours and coloristic effects. Likewise, the medium of sculpture allowed Degas to use his hands as his eyes in modeling the pliant wax. These sculpted studies of motion parallel contemporaneous examinations of locomotion by photographer Eadweard Muybridge, whose photographs Degas knew.

    "description": "\nDescription\nImages of labor abound in late-19th- and early 20th-century French art. From Jean-Francois Millets sowers and Gustave Courbets stone breakers to Berthe Morisots wet nurses and Edgar Degass dancers and milliners, workers were often idealized and portrayed as simple, robust souls who, because of their identification with the earth, with sustenance, and with survival, symbolized a state of blessed innocence. Perhaps no artist depicted the plight of the underclasses with greater poignancy than Picasso, who focused almost exclusively on the disenfranchised during his Blue Period (190104), known for its melancholy palette of predominantly blue tones and its gloomy themes. Living in relative poverty as a young, unknown artist during his early years in Paris, Picasso no doubt empathized with the laborers and beggars around him and often portrayed them with great sensitivity and pathos. Woman Ironing, painted at the end of the Blue Period in a lighter but still bleak color scheme of whites and grays, is Picassos quintessential image of travail and fatigue. Although rooted in the social and economic reality of turn-of-the-century Paris, the artists expressionistic treatment of his subjecthe endowed her with attenuated proportions and angular contoursreveals a distinct stylistic debt to the delicate, elongated forms of El Greco. Never simply a chronicler of empirical facts, Picasso here imbued his subject with a poetic, almost spiritual presence, making her a metaphor for the misfortunes of the working poor.Picassos attention soon shifted from the creation of social and quasi-religious allegories to an investigation of space, volume, and perception, culminating in the invention of Cubism. His portrait Fernande with a Black Mantilla is a transitional work.

    "description": "\nDescription\nImages of labor abound in late-19th- and early 20th-century French art. From Jean-Francois Millets sowers and Gustave Courbets stone breakers to Berthe Morisots wet nurses and Edgar Degass dancers and milliners, workers were often idealized and portrayed as simple, robust souls who, because of their identification with the earth, with sustenance, and with survival, symbolized a state of blessed innocence. Perhaps no artist depicted the plight of the underclasses with greater poignancy than Picasso, who focused almost exclusively on the disenfranchised during his Blue Period (190104), known for its melancholy palette of predominantly blue tones and its gloomy themes. Living in relative poverty as a young, unknown artist during his early years in Paris, Picasso no doubt empathized with the laborers and beggars around him and often portrayed them with great sensitivity and pathos. Woman Ironing, painted at the end of the Blue Period in a lighter but still bleak color scheme of whites and grays, is Picassos quintessential image of travail and fatigue. Although rooted in the social and economic reality of turn-of-the-century Paris, the artists expressionistic treatment of his subjecthe endowed her with attenuated proportions and angular contoursreveals a distinct stylistic debt to the delicate, elongated forms of El Greco. Never simply a chronicler of empirical facts, Picasso here imbued his subject with a poetic, almost spiritual presence, making her a metaphor for the misfortunes of the working poor.Picassos attention soon shifted from the creation of social and quasi-religious allegories to an investigation of space, volume, and perception, culminating in the invention of Cubism. His portrait Fernande with a Black Mantilla is a transitional work. Still somewhat expressionistic and romantic, with its subdued tonality and lively brushstrokes, the picture depicts his mistress Fernande Olivier wearing a mantilla, which perhaps symbolizes the artists Spanish origins. The iconic stylization of her face and its abbreviated features, however, foretell Picassos increasing interest in the abstract qualities and solidity of Iberian sculpture, which would profoundly influence his subsequent works.

    "description": "\nDescription\nGeorges Braque exhibited his work publicly for the first time in March 1906 at the Salon des Independants in Paris. The seven paintings he showed therewhich he later destroyedwere done in a style that combined naturalistic color with Impressionist brushstrokes. At the exhibitors' opening, he met Andre Derain and Henri Matisse, whose work was considerably more advanced than his. Derain showed three forceful pictures at that Salon, and Matisse exhibited his revolutionary Le Bonheur de vivre (The Joy of Life, 190506). These brightly colored and vigorously painted Fauve works disquieted Braque and gave him much to think about when he returned home to Le Havre later that spring.In June 1906 Braque and his fellow Havrais painter Emile-Othon Friesz traveled to Antwerp, one of the most active ports in Europe, where Friesz had worked the previous summer. The city was in some ways like a larger version of Le Havre, so it offered the advantage of providing familiar motifs while being foreign enough to give them the feeling of being abroad. This sense of displacement may well have encouraged them to take greater liberties in their paintings. They stayed on the left bank of the Scheldt River; Landscape near Antwerp (Paysage pres d'Anvers, 1906) is set on the dunes there. On the opposite bank, we can see one of the large commercial buildings and some of the smaller houses along the embankment. Near the center of the painting is the brightly colored spar of a sailboat, and in the distance off to the right are the more elaborate masts of a group of schooners.The color scheme reflects Braque's interest in the chromatic boldness of Fauve painting. If this and related works can be said to have initiated Braque's Fauve period, it is not only because of their imaginative color, but also because of the emphasis that Braque gave to the patterning of forms on the surface of the canvas. A good deal of the canvas ground is left showing, and there is no evidence of preliminary pencil drawing. Rather, the work was executed following Paul Cezanne's practice of painting and drawing at the same time. The wedgelike form of the water has the interesting effect of seeming to follow a one-point perspective into deep space while at the same time asserting itself very strongly as a finely designed flat shape. This tension between surface and depth is maintained by the dotted accents of color in the water: they articulate the depth of the area near the mound of earth, but at the same time they strongly restate the surface of the picture. In its finely balanced color harmonies and inventive brushwork, and in the attention that Braque gave to its underlying structure, Landscape near Antwerp anticipates the more fully realized paintings that he would produce at L'Estaque the following fall.Jack Flam\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nClaude Monets preponderant role in the development of Impressionism tends to overshadow the fact that his views of Venice, made in the first decade of the twentieth century, were directly contemporaneous with one of the most crucial moments in the history of Modernism: Pablo Picassos passage to Cubism in 190708. Similarly, it is easy to forget that Monets Venetian paintings succeeded by just a couple of years the full-fledged explosion of colors that took place at the hands of Andre Derain, Henri Matisse, and Maurice de Vlaminck during their short-lived Fauve episode in 190506. Arguably, Monets high-pitched and color-saturated views of Venice owe more to Derains paintings of London of 190506 (such as Big Ben, 1905, Musee dart Moderne de Troyes) than to his own early Impressionist scenes of that city, made in 187071. Reciprocally, these paintings by Derain had been prompted by Monets views of the Thames, begun in 1899 and exhibited at the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris in 1904. These mutual interactions, which paved the way toward the series of views of Venice, situate Monets artistic production at the dawn of the twentieth century within a broad Modernist canonrather than in a languishing and aging Impressionist idiom.Of the three dozen paintings that Monet produced in Venice in 1908, twenty-nine were exhibited for the first time as a seriesor, more accurately, as a group of seriesat the gallery Bernheim-Jeune in Paris from May 28 to June 8, 1912. Monets exhibition was hailed as a triumph by most critics, who did not fail to draw a connection between his work and early modernism. Guillaume Apollinaire, the poet, art critic, and great champion of Cubism, was laudatory about Monet. To Apollinaires eye, Cubism was a pure, lucid art that did not attempt to transmit a visual perception of any object, but to give an idea, i.e., the objective truth of that object.1 It was around this same notion of truthfulness that Apollinaire praised Monets views of Venice, writing that this concern for truth led the viewer to understand Venice apart from its mythical status and reduced to its reality: canals seen through mist or haze. The artists views of the city are animated by his desire to get down to the bare essentials of what he selected to look at. Venice was, for him, a return to basic materialsstones, light, water, misteach interacting with the other to produce a mosaic of suffused iridescent hues that saturate the entire surface of the canvas. Never before had Venice been so severely stripped of all its mythical attributes; never had the materiality of the air and the haze and their colors coalesced into something as realas truthfulas they did in Monets paintings.Joachim Pissarro1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nHenri Rousseau endured the art-historical misfortune of being a working-class late bloomerhe was a Sunday painter who only began to paint seriously in his 40swith what seemed to his critics little natural talent. His unsentimental, haunting images nonetheless drew the attention of a literary and artistic coterie hungry for fresh recruits. How did Rousseau, whose style still commands belittling adjectives such as naive and simple, escape relegation to the margins of art history? It was, as the writer Andre Malraux has pointed out, the former toll clerks friendship with a legion of well-established masters that has by and large guaranteed his place in the history of Modern art. During his lifetime Rousseau became something of a sensation within the relatively small Parisian art scene. His astonishing works were celebrated by Guillaume Apollinaire, Alfred Jarry, and Pablo Picasso, and he came to be considered a major force by artists such as Max Beckmann, Vasily Kandinsky, and Fernand Leger only a few years after his paupers death.To the extent that he had limited official success while he lived, Rousseau can be said to have invented himselfhe barged uninvited into exhibitions and dinner parties alike, assuming the posture of an honored guestjust as he invented images unlike anything around him. Canvases such as Artillerymen and The Football Players have been interpreted as Rousseaus quirky attempts to depict modern times, whether with a dapper military company as in the former example, or with the four natty enthusiasts of a new sport, rugby, in the latter. It is to his credit that we still have no adequate words to describe a painting in which rugby players look like pajama-clad twins, or one in which 14 identical handlebar mustaches succeed in delivering a spirited image of an artillery battery.Cornelia Lauf\r\n        ",

The rider is featured in many woodcuts, temperas, and oils, from its first appearance in the artists folk-inspired paintings, executed in his native Russia at the turn of the century, to his abstracted landscapes made in Munich during the early 1910s. The horseman was also incorporated into the cover designs for Kandinskys theoretical manifesto of 1911, On the Spiritual in Art, and the contemporaneous Blue Rider Almanac, which he coedited with Franz Marc.In 1909, the year he completed Blue Mountain, Kandinsky painted no less than seven other canvases with images of riders. In that year his style became increasingly abstract and expressionistic and his thematic concerns shifted from the portrayal of natural events to apocalyptic narratives. By 1910 many of the artists abstract canvases shared a common literary source, the Revelation of Saint John the Divine; the rider came to signify the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, who will bring epic destruction after which the world will be redeemed. In both Sketch for Composition II and Improvisation 28 (second version) Kandinsky depictedthrough highly schematized meanscataclysmic events on one side of the canvas and the paradise of spiritual salvation on the other. In the latter painting, for instance, images of a boat and waves (signaling the global deluge), a serpent, and, perhaps, cannons emerge on the left, while an embracing couple, shining sun, and celebratory candles appear on the right.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nFor more than a decade after graduating from art school in 1897, Piet Mondrian created naturalistic drawings and paintings that reflect a succession of stylistic influences including academic realism, Dutch Impressionism, and Symbolism. During this period and intermittently until the mid-1920s Mondrian created more than a hundred pictures of flowers. Reflecting years later on his attraction to the subject, he wrote, I enjoyed painting flowers, not bouquets, but a single flower at a time, in order that I might better express its plastic structure. The heavy crooked line of Chrysanthemum suggests Mondrians debt to Post-Impressionism, specifically the work of Vincent van Gogh. In 1909 Mondrian became interested in theosophy, a type of philosophical mysticism that seeks to disclose the concealed essences of reality. I too find flowers beautiful in their exterior beauty, he wrote a few years later, yet there is hidden within a deeper beauty.Mondrian was inspired by Paul Cezannes method of breaking down compositional elements into facets of color. In Still Life with Gingerpot I Mondrian began to employ such avant-garde techniques as passage (brushwork that continues beyond the designated edges of objects) and a generally looser handling of paint. Although muted, the palette of Still Life with Gingerpot I repeats the buoyant blues and roses of Mondrians earlier works, as well as their more naturalistic style of representation, exemplified by the retention of traditional perspective and the coherent integrity of the components of the still life such as the glass and saucepan.Still Life with Gingerpot II takes the artists first depiction of this motif to a much greater level of abstraction. The grid framework now interpolates the objects on the tabletop, and no vestiges of the glassware, stacked canvases, or window frame of the earlier composition remain. Mondrians works of this period are characterized by a strong central motif (here the gingerpot) around which the rest of the picture revolves in a symmetrical fashion. While in later paintings Mondrian developed a more dispersed field, his overarching concern for balance and order remained constant.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWhen Georges Braque abandoned a bright Fauve palette and traditional perspective in 1908, it was the inspiration of Paul Cezanne's geometrized compositions that led him to simplified faceted forms, flattened spatial planes, and muted colors. By the end of that year, Braque and Pablo Picasso, who first met in 1907, began to compare the results of their techniques and it became obvious to both artists that they had simultaneously and independently invented a revolutionary style of painting, later dubbed \"Cubism\" by Guillaume Apollinaire. During the next few years the new style blossomed with stunning rapidity from its initial formative stage to high Analytic Cubism. The hallmarks of this advanced phase, so-called for the \"breaking down\" or \"analysis\" of form and space, are seen in an extraordinary pair of pendant works, Violin and Palette (Violon et palette, 190910) and Piano and Mandola (Piano et mandore, 190910).Objects are still recognizable in the paintings, but are fractured into multiple facets, as is the surrounding space with which they merge. The compositions are set into motion as the eye moves from one faceted plane to the next, seeking to differentiate forms and to accommodate shifting sources of light and orientation. In Violin and Palette, the segmented parts of the violin, the sheets of music, and the artist's palette are vertically arranged, heightening their correspondence to the two-dimensional surface. Ironically, Braque depicted the nail at the top of the canvas in an illusionistic manner, down to the very shadow it cast, thus emphasizing the contrast between traditional and Cubist modes of representation. The same applies to the naturalistic candle in Piano and Mandola, which serves as a beacon of stability in an otherwise energized composition of exploding crystalline forms: the black-and-white piano keys all but disembodied; the sheets of music virtually disintegrated; the mandola essentially decomposed.\"When fragmented objects appeared in my painting around 1909,\" Braque later explained, \"it was a way for me to get as close as possible to the object as painting allowed.\"1 If the appeal of still life was its implied tactile qualities, as Braque noted, then musical instruments held even more significance in that they are animated by one's touch.

    "description": "\nDescription\nGroup in Crinolines is a transitional work in Vasily Kandinskys career, indicating a shift from his early fairy-tale pictures to highly abstracted images. Though painted in Munich two years after Kandinsky lived and worked in Paris from 1906 to 1907, this canvas attests to his appreciation of modern French art. The plein-air social gathering of men and women dressed in Biedermeier fashion is reminiscent of Manets portrait of leisure life, Music in the Tuileries Gardens (1862). Kandinsky admired Manets work for what he construed to be an emphasis on painting itself rather than a mimetic translation of the empirical world. While the content of Group in Crinolines may resemble that of 19th-century Impressionist scenes, its brilliant, radical color scheme is clearly Fauvist in inspiration. During his stay in Paris, Kandinsky exhibited at the Salon dAutomne of 1906 in which Matisse and the Fauves were prominently featured. He pronounced Matisse to be one of the greatest of the modern French painters in his 1911 treatise On the Spiritual in Art.1Kandinsky painted a second version of Group in Crinolines, which was included in the first exhibition of the Neue Kunstlervereinigung Munchen in 1909. In 1911 Kandinsky painted Pastorale (Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York), a canvas similar in theme to, but formally more abstract than, Group in Crinolines. Kandinsky recast the semirealistic, though idyllic, image of formally attired people of Group of Crinolines into a highly stylized utopian landscape in Pastorale.Nancy Spector1. Kenneth C.

    "description": "\nDescription\nCubism, which developed in the crucial years from 1907 to 1914, is widely regarded as the most innovative and influential artistic style of the 20th century. A decisive moment in its development occurred during the summer of 1911, when Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso painted side by side in Ceret, in the French Pyrenees, each artist producing paintings that are difficultsometimes virtually impossibleto distinguish from those of the other.Picassos still life Carafe, Jug, and Fruit Bowl, painted two summers before, shows an earlier stage of this style. Surfaces are broken into sharply defined planes but are not yet complexly fragmented; forms still retain an illusion of volume; and perspective, though dramatically shortened, is not obliterated. At its climax, Braque and Picasso brought Analytic Cubism almost to the point of complete abstraction. Among such works is Picassos Accordionist, a baffling composition that one of its former owners mistook for a landscape because of the inscription Ceret on the reverse. With diligence, one can distinguish the general outlines of the seated accordionist, denoted by a series of shifting vertically aligned triangular planes, semicircular shapes, and right angles; the centrally located folds of the accordion and its keys; and, in the lower portion of the canvas, the volutes of an armchair. But Picassos elusive references to recognizable forms and objects cannot always be precisely identified and, as the Museum of Modern Arts founding director Alfred H. Barr, Jr. observed, the mysterious tension between painted image and reality remains.In Landscape at Ceret, another canvas painted that summer, patches of muted earthy color, schematized stairways, and arched window configurations exist as visual clues that must be pieced together. For this painting, as with all Cubist works, the total image must be thought as much as seen.Jan Avgikos\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMoving between the extremes of minute domestic interiors and monumental, tapestry-like decorative canvases, French artist Edouard Vuillard persisted in emphasizing the surface of his paintings with matte multicolored patterns, muted stippling, and flattened space. Born in Cuiseaux, France, Vuillard moved to Paris in 1877, eventually attending the Academie Julian and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Over time he met several of the artists who would become, as he did, members of the Nabis (the prophets). This Post-Impressionist group, which challenged current naturalist impulses and the elitism of easel painting, pursued subject matter infused with suggestive Symbolist themes and a style characterized by intense color, synthetic two-dimensional compositions, and reductive forms, often in large-scale decorative works. Vuillard also was dubbed an Intimistalong with Nabis members such as Pierre Bonnard and Ker-Xavier Rousselbecause he culled his subject-matter from the intimate world of family life. He habitually depicted his seamstress mother (with whom he lived until her death in 1928) and his sister in claustrophobic images filled with a profusion of patterns: striped dresses, variegated fabrics, and flowered wallpaper.During the 1890s, Vuillard frequented the intellectuals, artists, and patrons associated with the avant-garde journal La revue blanche. Following its closure, in 1903, he gained a less radical, if more upper-class, set of friends and patrons. In this period, Vuillard shifted from painting psychologically charged interiors and mural-size outdoor scenes to more schematic birds-eye perspectives of Paris. In 1908, he embarked on a series of commissioned decorative panels of Place Vintimille, a typical bourgeois Parisian square that he could see from the window of his apartment. In their architectural, screenlike format, the Place Vintimille (190810) panels hearkened back to work Vuillard had done for the theater. They also denoted his ongoing adherence to the decorative aesthetics espoused by the Nabis (which had disbanded in 1899) as well as the formal language of Japanese art, exemplified by the adoption of the screen format, the depiction of asymmetrical views, and the abrupt cropping of forms. Vuillard would continue to paint decorative works for private and public spaces, along with more traditional portraits set in interiors, until the last years of his life.Vivien Greene\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nRobert Delaunay chose the view into the ambulatory of the Parisian Gothic church Saint-Severin as the subject of his first series of paintings, in which he charted the modulations of light streaming through the stained-glass windows and the resulting perceptual distortion of the architecture. The subdued palette and the patches of color that fracture the smooth surface of the floor point to the influence of Paul Cezanne as well as to the stylistic elements of Georges Braques early Cubist landscapes. Delaunay said that the Saint-Severin theme in his work marked a period of transition from Cezanne to Cubism.Delaunay explored the developments of Cubist fragmentation more explicitly in his series of paintings of the Eiffel Tower. In these canvases, characteristic of his self-designated destructive phase, the artist presented the tower and surrounding buildings from various perspectives. Delaunay chose a subject that allowed him to indulge his preference for a sense of vast space, atmosphere, and light, while evoking a sign of modernity and progress. Like the soaring vaults of Gothic cathedrals, the Eiffel Tower is a uniquely French symbol of invention and aspiration. Many of Delaunays images of this structure and the surrounding city are views from a window framed by curtains. In Eiffel Tower (painted in 1911, although it bears the date 1910) the buildings bracketing the tower curve like drapery.The artists attraction to windows and window views, linked to the Symbolists use of glass panes as metaphors for the transition from internal to external states, culminated in his Simultaneous Windows series. (The series derives its name from the French scientist Michel-Eugene Chevreuls theory of simultaneous contrasts of color, which explores how divergent hues are perceived at once.) Delaunay stated that these works began his constructive phase, in which he juxtaposed and overlaid translucent contrasting complementary colors to create a synthetic, harmonic composition. Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a poem about these paintings and coined the word Orphism to describe Delaunays endeavor, which he believed was as independent of descriptive reality as was music (the name derives from Orpheus, the mythological lyre player). Although Simultaneous Windows (2nd Motif, 1st Part) contains a vestigial green profile of the Eiffel Tower, it is one of the artists last salutes to representation before his leap to complete abstraction.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

In the latter painting, for instance, images of a boat and waves (signaling the global deluge), a serpent, and, perhaps, cannons emerge on the left, while an embracing couple, shining sun, and celebratory candles appear on the right.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlthough he moved to Paris at a young age, Frantisek Kupkas Bohemian origins, mysticism, and eccentric personality kept him at a distance from the avant-garde circles of the artistic capital. An individualist, he rejected association with any artistic school or trend, but his paintings aggressive palette and dependence on color as a means of faceting form and conveying meaning show undeniable affinities with Fauvism and the work of Henri Matisse, as well as with Orphism, Robert Delaunays color-based brand of Cubism. A devoted mystic, Kupka spent his life in search of a transcendental other reality, or fourth dimension. One of the first non-objective artists, he extended his clairvoyant practice to his art as well, by uniting a metaphysical investigation of the human body and nature with daring color and abstract form.Theosophya synthesis of philosophy, religion, and scienceguided Kupkas holistic approach to art. His paintings draw on a variety of sources, including ancient myths, color theory, and contemporary scientific developments. The invention of radiography at the turn of the century was especially significant for Kupka, whose search for an alternative dimension through a kind of painterly X-ray vision is captured in his monumental Planes by Colors, Large Nude. In this work, Kupka rendered the figure of his wife, Eugenie, in vivid shades of purple, green, yellow, and blue, devising an innovative modeling technique based on color, not line or shade, that sections her body into tonal planes in such a way that her inner form is made visible. This unveiling of the unseen is crucial, for Kupka believed that it is only through the senses, through physical experience, that we can reach an extrasensory, metaphysical dimension and thereafter achieve an intuitive understanding of the universal scheme underlying existence.Kupka painted The Colored One ten years after Planes by Colors, Large Nude. By then he had adopted a more boldly abstract mode of figural representation. (He would never abandon subject matter altogether, however, unlike pure abstractionists such as Piet Mondrian.) The Colored One also depicts a female nude, this one lying on her back with legs stretched upward, cradling a radiant yellow sun. Swirling forms outlined in concentrated colors convey the dominant theme in Kupkas work: the organic connections that intertwine human beings with the rest of nature and the cosmos.Bridget Alsdorf\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn March 1909, the collector Sergei Shchukin commissioned Henri Matisse to paint decorative panels for his Moscow home. That summer, the artist stayed at Cavaliere, a small town on the Cote dAzur in France. There, he posed a model, whom he had brought from Paris, outdoors and painted several works from life. Nude in a Forest (Nu dans un paysage ensoleille) is almost certainly one of these. The small pink figure, arms at her sides and head inclined to the left, stands centered on the canvas like the central figure in Paul Cezannes Three Bathers (Trois baigneuses, 187982), which Matisse owned. The nude is framed and echoed by tree trunks, her feet nearly encircled by tan and pale yellow, representing a sunlit patch of ground. A sliver of warm blue sky points directly at the top of the models head. Space in the painting is deliberately flat; despite the avenue of tree trunks in a perspectival formation and perhaps some coloristic indications, no real feeling of recession into depth is achieved. The figure and her surroundings remain on the surface. Thus pushed forward and emphasized by formal devices, the rosy body of the relatively tiny nude is not lost among the more assertive blues, greens, yellows, and earth tones of the setting.\nAlthough more naturalistic in its hues and details, this casually painted sketch anticipates the simplified forms and patterning of flat color developed further in Dance (La danse) and Music (La musique), the monumental canvases for Shchukins house that were completed in 1910. While the formal innovations of Dance and Musicbold color, schematic articulation of the figures, and flat treatment of spaceensure their position as influential paradigms of early modern art, the overt subject of nude figures in nature connects these works to a painting tradition that extends back to the Renaissance. Matisse himself has essayed this form before, most notably in The Joy of Life (Bonheur de vivre, 190506). The studies painted at Cavaliere relate even more directly to a third panel of the Shchukin commission that Matisse had originally planned; a watercolor sketch for this proposed third painting features women bathing and standing in a landscape. The zone of blue behind the model in the Guggenheim painting may indicate a body of water like that seen both in other works executed that summer in Cavaliere.\nJoseph R. Wolin\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nEdgar Degas's penetrating and sometimes disturbing depictions of late 19th-century Parisian society are as much innovative explorations of movement and pictorial space as they are portrayals of contemporary life. Degas was from a privileged background, born of a well-to-do family in Paris. After studying law briefly, he turned to art in 1855, attending the Ecole des Beaux-Arts for a time. While he became associated with the Impressionists, Degas belonged to a slightly older generation of artists, which is apparent in the naturalist style of his early portraits and interiors. But, his quintessential works date from the Impressionist decades of the 1870s and 1880s. Like his cohorts, he cast his gaze upon Paris's electrifying society of spectacle, painting scenes of the cafe-concert, the opera, and the races. He also looked to those living on the fringes of this world: alienated people drinking absinthe, laundresses, milliners, and prostitutes. Perhaps, most recognizable are his ballerinas, seen in dance classes, at rest, rehearsing, and performing.Degas's formal investigations, however, remained paramount, and his subjects, who often seem caught unaware from unusual angles in awkward poses, are vehicles for these explorations. Blurred action and the dramatic cropping of figures or forms reveal conventions adopted from photography (which he also practiced), signaling the instantaneity that the Impressionists embraced. The cropping, together with his incongruous compositional constructions, was also influenced by the non-illusionistic treatment of space and form of Japanese prints, which had gained popularity in France during the 1860s.In the mid-1880s, his vision began to fail and the more forgiving medium of pastel became increasingly important to the artist, who fully exploited its soft, blurred contours and coloristic effects. Likewise, the medium of sculpture allowed Degas to use his hands as his eyes in modeling the pliant wax. These sculpted studies of motion parallel contemporaneous examinations of locomotion by photographer Eadweard Muybridge, whose photographs Degas knew. Both Dancers in Green and Yellow and Seated Woman, Wiping Her Left Side date from this period. While each work represents a certain type of exploited lower-class womanballerinas often relied upon the patronage of their wealthy, male admirers, while the nude woman washing in a prosaic pose was a prostitutethese works are primarily examples of his lifelong interest in gesture and movement. His deteriorating eyesight eventually forced Degas to cease making art sometime between 1910 and 1912.\n",

After moving to Munich to study painting in 1896, he began to create picturesque, open-air oil sketches of his surroundings. For example, the house depicted in Munich (Munchen, ca. 190102) is typical of a small group of houses still standing in the vicinity of Kandinskys first residence in the city. He continued this practice between the years of 1903 and 1908, during which he traveled extensively between Germany and Russia. The scene depicted in AmsterdamView from the Window (AmsterdamBlick aus dem Fenster, 1904) is a neat encapsulation of the niceties of Amersterdam: the view is from an upper window of the American Hotel on the Leidseplein, showing the bridge over the Singel gracht, the towers of the Lido, the Vondelpark, and the Park Hotel. Fishing Boats, Sestri (Fischerboote, Sestri, 1905) and Pond in the Park (Parkteich, ca. 1906) represent the artists impressions of other cities and landscapes that he visited during this period. Such works reveal Kandinskys strong interest in the tradition of capturing light and the life of cities evident in Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, as well as his love of vibrant and expressive color.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMoving between the extremes of minute domestic interiors and monumental, tapestry-like decorative canvases, French artist Edouard Vuillard persisted in emphasizing the surface of his paintings with matte multicolored patterns, muted stippling, and flattened space. Born in Cuiseaux, France, Vuillard moved to Paris in 1877, eventually attending the Academie Julian and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Over time he met several of the artists who would become, as he did, members of the Nabis (the prophets). This Post-Impressionist group, which challenged current naturalist impulses and the elitism of easel painting, pursued subject matter infused with suggestive Symbolist themes and a style characterized by intense color, synthetic two-dimensional compositions, and reductive forms, often in large-scale decorative works. Vuillard also was dubbed an Intimistalong with Nabis members such as Pierre Bonnard and Ker-Xavier Rousselbecause he culled his subject-matter from the intimate world of family life. He habitually depicted his seamstress mother (with whom he lived until her death in 1928) and his sister in claustrophobic images filled with a profusion of patterns: striped dresses, variegated fabrics, and flowered wallpaper.During the 1890s, Vuillard frequented the intellectuals, artists, and patrons associated with the avant-garde journal La revue blanche. Following its closure, in 1903, he gained a less radical, if more upper-class, set of friends and patrons. In this period, Vuillard shifted from painting psychologically charged interiors and mural-size outdoor scenes to more schematic birds-eye perspectives of Paris. In 1908, he embarked on a series of commissioned decorative panels of Place Vintimille, a typical bourgeois Parisian square that he could see from the window of his apartment. In their architectural, screenlike format, the Place Vintimille (190810) panels hearkened back to work Vuillard had done for the theater. They also denoted his ongoing adherence to the decorative aesthetics espoused by the Nabis (which had disbanded in 1899) as well as the formal language of Japanese art, exemplified by the adoption of the screen format, the depiction of asymmetrical views, and the abrupt cropping of forms. Vuillard would continue to paint decorative works for private and public spaces, along with more traditional portraits set in interiors, until the last years of his life.Vivien Greene\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWhen Georges Braque abandoned a bright Fauve palette and traditional perspective in 1908, it was the inspiration of Paul Cezanne's geometrized compositions that led him to simplified faceted forms, flattened spatial planes, and muted colors. By the end of that year, Braque and Pablo Picasso, who first met in 1907, began to compare the results of their techniques and it became obvious to both artists that they had simultaneously and independently invented a revolutionary style of painting, later dubbed \"Cubism\" by Guillaume Apollinaire. During the next few years the new style blossomed with stunning rapidity from its initial formative stage to high Analytic Cubism. The hallmarks of this advanced phase, so-called for the \"breaking down\" or \"analysis\" of form and space, are seen in an extraordinary pair of pendant works, Violin and Palette (Violon et palette, 190910) and Piano and Mandola (Piano et mandore, 190910).Objects are still recognizable in the paintings, but are fractured into multiple facets, as is the surrounding space with which they merge. The compositions are set into motion as the eye moves from one faceted plane to the next, seeking to differentiate forms and to accommodate shifting sources of light and orientation. In Violin and Palette, the segmented parts of the violin, the sheets of music, and the artist's palette are vertically arranged, heightening their correspondence to the two-dimensional surface. Ironically, Braque depicted the nail at the top of the canvas in an illusionistic manner, down to the very shadow it cast, thus emphasizing the contrast between traditional and Cubist modes of representation. The same applies to the naturalistic candle in Piano and Mandola, which serves as a beacon of stability in an otherwise energized composition of exploding crystalline forms: the black-and-white piano keys all but disembodied; the sheets of music virtually disintegrated; the mandola essentially decomposed.\"When fragmented objects appeared in my painting around 1909,\" Braque later explained, \"it was a way for me to get as close as possible to the object as painting allowed.\"1 If the appeal of still life was its implied tactile qualities, as Braque noted, then musical instruments held even more significance in that they are animated by one's touch. Like the rhythms and harmonies that are the life of musical instruments, dynamic spatial movement is the essence of Braque's lyrical Cubist paintings.Jan Avgikos1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nRobert Delaunay chose the view into the ambulatory of the Parisian Gothic church Saint-Severin as the subject of his first series of paintings, in which he charted the modulations of light streaming through the stained-glass windows and the resulting perceptual distortion of the architecture. The subdued palette and the patches of color that fracture the smooth surface of the floor point to the influence of Paul Cezanne as well as to the stylistic elements of Georges Braques early Cubist landscapes. Delaunay said that the Saint-Severin theme in his work marked a period of transition from Cezanne to Cubism.Delaunay explored the developments of Cubist fragmentation more explicitly in his series of paintings of the Eiffel Tower. In these canvases, characteristic of his self-designated destructive phase, the artist presented the tower and surrounding buildings from various perspectives. Delaunay chose a subject that allowed him to indulge his preference for a sense of vast space, atmosphere, and light, while evoking a sign of modernity and progress. Like the soaring vaults of Gothic cathedrals, the Eiffel Tower is a uniquely French symbol of invention and aspiration. Many of Delaunays images of this structure and the surrounding city are views from a window framed by curtains. In Eiffel Tower (painted in 1911, although it bears the date 1910) the buildings bracketing the tower curve like drapery.The artists attraction to windows and window views, linked to the Symbolists use of glass panes as metaphors for the transition from internal to external states, culminated in his Simultaneous Windows series. (The series derives its name from the French scientist Michel-Eugene Chevreuls theory of simultaneous contrasts of color, which explores how divergent hues are perceived at once.) Delaunay stated that these works began his constructive phase, in which he juxtaposed and overlaid translucent contrasting complementary colors to create a synthetic, harmonic composition. Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a poem about these paintings and coined the word Orphism to describe Delaunays endeavor, which he believed was as independent of descriptive reality as was music (the name derives from Orpheus, the mythological lyre player). Although Simultaneous Windows (2nd Motif, 1st Part) contains a vestigial green profile of the Eiffel Tower, it is one of the artists last salutes to representation before his leap to complete abstraction.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

The rider is featured in many woodcuts, temperas, and oils, from its first appearance in the artists folk-inspired paintings, executed in his native Russia at the turn of the century, to his abstracted landscapes made in Munich during the early 1910s. The horseman was also incorporated into the cover designs for Kandinskys theoretical manifesto of 1911, On the Spiritual in Art, and the contemporaneous Blue Rider Almanac, which he coedited with Franz Marc.In 1909, the year he completed Blue Mountain, Kandinsky painted no less than seven other canvases with images of riders. In that year his style became increasingly abstract and expressionistic and his thematic concerns shifted from the portrayal of natural events to apocalyptic narratives. By 1910 many of the artists abstract canvases shared a common literary source, the Revelation of Saint John the Divine; the rider came to signify the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, who will bring epic destruction after which the world will be redeemed. In both Sketch for Composition II and Improvisation 28 (second version) Kandinsky depictedthrough highly schematized meanscataclysmic events on one side of the canvas and the paradise of spiritual salvation on the other. In the latter painting, for instance, images of a boat and waves (signaling the global deluge), a serpent, and, perhaps, cannons emerge on the left, while an embracing couple, shining sun, and celebratory candles appear on the right.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlthough he moved to Paris at a young age, Frantisek Kupkas Bohemian origins, mysticism, and eccentric personality kept him at a distance from the avant-garde circles of the artistic capital. An individualist, he rejected association with any artistic school or trend, but his paintings aggressive palette and dependence on color as a means of faceting form and conveying meaning show undeniable affinities with Fauvism and the work of Henri Matisse, as well as with Orphism, Robert Delaunays color-based brand of Cubism. A devoted mystic, Kupka spent his life in search of a transcendental other reality, or fourth dimension. One of the first non-objective artists, he extended his clairvoyant practice to his art as well, by uniting a metaphysical investigation of the human body and nature with daring color and abstract form.Theosophya synthesis of philosophy, religion, and scienceguided Kupkas holistic approach to art. His paintings draw on a variety of sources, including ancient myths, color theory, and contemporary scientific developments. The invention of radiography at the turn of the century was especially significant for Kupka, whose search for an alternative dimension through a kind of painterly X-ray vision is captured in his monumental Planes by Colors, Large Nude. In this work, Kupka rendered the figure of his wife, Eugenie, in vivid shades of purple, green, yellow, and blue, devising an innovative modeling technique based on color, not line or shade, that sections her body into tonal planes in such a way that her inner form is made visible. This unveiling of the unseen is crucial, for Kupka believed that it is only through the senses, through physical experience, that we can reach an extrasensory, metaphysical dimension and thereafter achieve an intuitive understanding of the universal scheme underlying existence.Kupka painted The Colored One ten years after Planes by Colors, Large Nude. By then he had adopted a more boldly abstract mode of figural representation. (He would never abandon subject matter altogether, however, unlike pure abstractionists such as Piet Mondrian.) The Colored One also depicts a female nude, this one lying on her back with legs stretched upward, cradling a radiant yellow sun. Swirling forms outlined in concentrated colors convey the dominant theme in Kupkas work: the organic connections that intertwine human beings with the rest of nature and the cosmos.Bridget Alsdorf\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAs it was for many literary and artistic figures of the day, the Eiffel Tower became a symbol of modernity for Robert Delaunay. In its capacity as a radio tower, it embodied the international communication Delaunay envisioned breaking down boundaries and transforming Europe into a global community. He apparently first painted the tower in celebration of his engagement to Sonia Terk in 1909 and would make it the subject of at least thirty works over the next few years and again in the 1920s.In their limited palette and simple blocklike forms, Delaunays first treatments of the Eiffel Tower show the influence of Georges Braque and Paul Cezanne. The more dynamic representation of Eiffel Tower with Trees signals a shift in the artists style. Delaunay showed the tower from several viewpoints at once, suggesting the movement of the eye through space and time and expressing a Simultanist vision. By introducing the element of time, the artist was able to synthesize several impressions of the tower, capturing the full perceptual experience that Delaunay believed was the key to inner awareness. It is significant that this painting was executed when he was away from Paris, working from memory.Taking advantage of the vast space the tower inhabits, Delaunay retraced the motion of the eye as it follows the trajectory of the structure up to the sky and back down again. As the eye moves from the tree in the foreground to the distant tip of the tower, and follows the curved branch across the face of the building and travels down the column of clouds, the tower begins to swing back and forth between foreground and background, shifting between its position as an autonomous three-dimensional object and its part as an element of pattern in the picture surface as a whole.1 These optical effects become even more apparent in Delaunays later works from the Window series, which led him to a higher level of abstraction.Eiffel Tower with Trees marks the beginning of Delaunays destructive phase: the solid form in his earlier works becomes fragmented and begins to crumble, though, unlike the objects of the Cubists investigations, the tower here still remains distinguishable from the surrounding space. This works shows the beginnings of the artists use of light to permeate and fracture solid form, splintering his subject into a kaleidoscope of shattered elements. As Delaunays study of the energy and immateriality of light became more intense, his works began to express more clearly the artists belief that light is the essence of all beingthe only realityand our perception of it the path to harmony.Susan Cross1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nTwo of Frantisek Kupkas earliest purely abstract compositions are Amorpha, Warm Chromatic of 191112 and Amorpha, Fugue in Two Colors of 191112. The present pastel study reveals an early stage in the formal evolution of both of these paintings. In 1911 Kupka strove to eliminate objective subject matter from his paintings. His development toward abstraction is evident in his work of 1909 to 1911 in his interpretations of motion and of the light and color of Gothic stained-glass windows. The Peggy Guggenheim pastel relates to a series of studies that followed a naturalistic painting of 190809 of his stepdaughter Andree playing naked with a red-and-blue ball in the garden of their home. More than fifty studies led Kupka from conventional representation of this subject to the abstract formulations of the paintings of 1912. In a note on one of the pencil drawings of Little Girl with Ball, Kupka details his frustrations: Here I am only dissecting surfaces. The atmospheric copenetration is yet to be found. As long as there is a distinction in color between ground and flesh, I will fall back into the postcard photograph.In the Peggy Guggenheim study, Kupka articulated the girls motion by depicting the continuous penetration of the atmosphere by the ball. A curving brown body shape guides the ball through the blue path of its trajectory. This action occurs on a light green background plane, which suggests the three-dimensional space of the garden. Such residue of naturalistic color is abandoned in culminating versions of the study, such as Amorpha, Fugue in Two Colors, which are conceived in blue, red, black, and white. Kupka discerned a musical parallel to these abstract forms in the rhythmic patterns of the fugue, where the sounds evolve like veritable physical entities, intertwine, come and go.1 Kupkas paintings of this period are not simple or formulaic abstractions from ultimate sources in nature, but are rather pictorial syntheses of the artists formal ideas.Elizabeth C.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn March 1909, the collector Sergei Shchukin commissioned Henri Matisse to paint decorative panels for his Moscow home. That summer, the artist stayed at Cavaliere, a small town on the Cote dAzur in France. There, he posed a model, whom he had brought from Paris, outdoors and painted several works from life. Nude in a Forest (Nu dans un paysage ensoleille) is almost certainly one of these. The small pink figure, arms at her sides and head inclined to the left, stands centered on the canvas like the central figure in Paul Cezannes Three Bathers (Trois baigneuses, 187982), which Matisse owned. The nude is framed and echoed by tree trunks, her feet nearly encircled by tan and pale yellow, representing a sunlit patch of ground. A sliver of warm blue sky points directly at the top of the models head. Space in the painting is deliberately flat; despite the avenue of tree trunks in a perspectival formation and perhaps some coloristic indications, no real feeling of recession into depth is achieved. The figure and her surroundings remain on the surface. Thus pushed forward and emphasized by formal devices, the rosy body of the relatively tiny nude is not lost among the more assertive blues, greens, yellows, and earth tones of the setting.\nAlthough more naturalistic in its hues and details, this casually painted sketch anticipates the simplified forms and patterning of flat color developed further in Dance (La danse) and Music (La musique), the monumental canvases for Shchukins house that were completed in 1910. While the formal innovations of Dance and Musicbold color, schematic articulation of the figures, and flat treatment of spaceensure their position as influential paradigms of early modern art, the overt subject of nude figures in nature connects these works to a painting tradition that extends back to the Renaissance. Matisse himself has essayed this form before, most notably in The Joy of Life (Bonheur de vivre, 190506). The studies painted at Cavaliere relate even more directly to a third panel of the Shchukin commission that Matisse had originally planned; a watercolor sketch for this proposed third painting features women bathing and standing in a landscape. The zone of blue behind the model in the Guggenheim painting may indicate a body of water like that seen both in other works executed that summer in Cavaliere.\nJoseph R. Wolin\n",

When he moved from Russia to Paris in the summer of 1910, the artist took with him several of these paintings depicting the life and customs of his native Vitebsk. During the next year he reworked them and also painted new compositions with similar motifs, infused with nostalgia for his homeland, but now adapted according to techniques and concepts he acquired from exposure to current French art.Nondescriptive, saturated color is used in Rain in combination with assertive areas of white and black to produce a highly ornamental and vivid surface. Chagalls use of color was influenced by that of Henri Matisse and Robert Delaunay, whose work he saw almost immediately upon his arrival in Paris. The breaking up of some areas of the composition into shaded planes, for example the roof of the house and the left foreground, has its source in Cubism, though this device is handled somewhat randomly.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nRobert Delaunay chose the view into the ambulatory of the Parisian Gothic church Saint-Severin as the subject of his first series of paintings, in which he charted the modulations of light streaming through the stained-glass windows and the resulting perceptual distortion of the architecture. The subdued palette and the patches of color that fracture the smooth surface of the floor point to the influence of Paul Cezanne as well as to the stylistic elements of Georges Braques early Cubist landscapes. Delaunay said that the Saint-Severin theme in his work marked a period of transition from Cezanne to Cubism.Delaunay explored the developments of Cubist fragmentation more explicitly in his series of paintings of the Eiffel Tower. In these canvases, characteristic of his self-designated destructive phase, the artist presented the tower and surrounding buildings from various perspectives. Delaunay chose a subject that allowed him to indulge his preference for a sense of vast space, atmosphere, and light, while evoking a sign of modernity and progress. Like the soaring vaults of Gothic cathedrals, the Eiffel Tower is a uniquely French symbol of invention and aspiration. Many of Delaunays images of this structure and the surrounding city are views from a window framed by curtains. In Eiffel Tower (painted in 1911, although it bears the date 1910) the buildings bracketing the tower curve like drapery.The artists attraction to windows and window views, linked to the Symbolists use of glass panes as metaphors for the transition from internal to external states, culminated in his Simultaneous Windows series. (The series derives its name from the French scientist Michel-Eugene Chevreuls theory of simultaneous contrasts of color, which explores how divergent hues are perceived at once.) Delaunay stated that these works began his constructive phase, in which he juxtaposed and overlaid translucent contrasting complementary colors to create a synthetic, harmonic composition. Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a poem about these paintings and coined the word Orphism to describe Delaunays endeavor, which he believed was as independent of descriptive reality as was music (the name derives from Orpheus, the mythological lyre player). Although Simultaneous Windows (2nd Motif, 1st Part) contains a vestigial green profile of the Eiffel Tower, it is one of the artists last salutes to representation before his leap to complete abstraction.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1911, Marcel Duchamp, the great iconoclast of 20th-century art, was still adhering to the conventions of easel painting, formal composition, narrative structure, and individual inspiration. His formative years were bracketed by studies at the Academie Julien in Paris in 190405 and participation in the artistic circle known as the Puteaux Group, which gathered at the home of his older brothers and fellow artists, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Jacques Villon, after 1910. During this period, Duchamp moved rapidly through a succession of Modernist styles before renouncing painting altogether in 1913 in favor of an art that privileged the intellectual over the optical.Prior to this conversion, which would radically alter the development of Western art, Duchamp frequently painted the members of his family. A relatively realistic canvas from 1910 depicts his brothers engrossed in a game of chess in their garden while his two sisters look on. The significantly more abstracted painting Sonata (1911), is a portrait of the artists mother and sisters as a musical ensemble; their fragmented and interlocking bodies echoing Cubisms dissolution and rearrangement of forms in space. Apropos of Little Sister similarly fractures the integrity of the figure to reinforce its interrelationship with the surrounding composition. The sitter is Magdeleine, Duchamps youngest sibling, who was 13 at the time. She is seated, reading a book by candlelight; her attenuated limbs and curving spine form a sinuous S-curve that reverberates in the loosely painted environment around her.Toward the end of 1911, Duchamp returned to the theme of chess, creating a series of at least six drawings and two Cubist paintings of his brothers completely absorbed by the game. The Guggenheim drawing was produced late in the sequence, perhaps between the execution of the two canvases, given that its shades of green and tan watercolor relate to the palette of the latter painting.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1911, Marcel Duchamp, the great iconoclast of 20th-century art, was still adhering to the conventions of easel painting, formal composition, narrative structure, and individual inspiration. His formative years were bracketed by studies at the Academie Julien in Paris in 190405 and participation in the artistic circle known as the Puteaux Group, which gathered at the home of his older brothers and fellow artists, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Jacques Villon, after 1910. During this period, Duchamp moved rapidly through a succession of Modernist styles before renouncing painting altogether in 1913 in favor of an art that privileged the intellectual over the optical.Prior to this conversion, which would radically alter the development of Western art, Duchamp frequently painted the members of his family. A relatively realistic canvas from 1910 depicts his brothers engrossed in a game of chess in their garden while his two sisters look on. The significantly more abstracted painting Sonata (1911), is a portrait of the artists mother and sisters as a musical ensemble; their fragmented and interlocking bodies echoing Cubisms dissolution and rearrangement of forms in space. Apropos of Little Sister similarly fractures the integrity of the figure to reinforce its interrelationship with the surrounding composition. The sitter is Magdeleine, Duchamps youngest sibling, who was 13 at the time. She is seated, reading a book by candlelight; her attenuated limbs and curving spine form a sinuous S-curve that reverberates in the loosely painted environment around her.Toward the end of 1911, Duchamp returned to the theme of chess, creating a series of at least six drawings and two Cubist paintings of his brothers completely absorbed by the game. The Guggenheim drawing was produced late in the sequence, perhaps between the execution of the two canvases, given that its shades of green and tan watercolor relate to the palette of the latter painting. Rendered on lined stationery from Pariss Hotel Lutetia, the drawing is intimate in scale but dense with visual information. The profiles of the two players interlock above the perspectival game board; vectors radiating out from center represent the intense intellectual activity at play.

    "description": "\nDescription\nBeginning in 1902, Juan Gris contributed drawings to illustrated journals, first in his birthplace Madrid and then in Paris, where he settled in 1906. Working in an Art Nouveau style, he supported himself with his humorous and satirical drawings and caricatures. Gris resided at Le Bateau Lavoir at 13, rue Ravignan, where Pablo Picasso also lived. Witness to the birth of Cubism, Gris embraced the revolutionary approach and participated in its early evolution. In Houses in Paris (Maisons a Paris), one of at least six canvases of his Montmartre neighborhood painted in 1911, the artist experimented with tropes he learned from Picasso and Georges Braque while retaining his own sensibility and color palette. Creating severely flattened architectural spaces and rendering passages of shadow and light on their own plane, Gris applied a modern technique to the urban landscapeas Robert Delaunay and Fernand Leger were doing in their canvaseswhile drawing on his work as an illustrator for the juxtaposition of shapes, strong tonal contrasts, and overall visual rhythm of the surface.The outbreak of World War I dispersed many in Griss milieu, the artists and writers central to Cubisms development in Paris. Guillaume Apollinaire, Braque, Andre Derain, Albert Gleizes, Leger, and Louis Marcoussis, among many others entered military service from which Gris was exempt due to his Spanish citizenship. Renowned dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler who represented Gris since 1912 was forced to leave Paris for Bern, Switzerland. In November 1917 Leonce Rosenberg took up the sales of Griss work, and during the same month Gris painted Fruit Dish on a Checkered Tablecloth (Compotier et nappe a carreaux). Like other still lifes from this period, this work is particularly rich in texture and color, featuring overlapping patterns and compositional elements that reflect the artists practice in collage.Despite Cubisms break with traditional painting, such as eliminating the representation of depth in this canvas, Gris valued the conventions of painting still lifes and shunned the explorations into total abstraction that was of interest to some Cubists such as Jean Metzinger and Amedee Ozenfant. Gris admitted to studying the subjects and methods of the old mastersOzenfant called him a specialist in museumsin his effort to reconcile modern expression and historical traditions. Rooted by the still-life legacy essential to Spanish painting, Gris maintained a reverence for the object and the poetic metaphors that could be suggested by the evocative combination of these objects.Tracey Bashkoff\n",

In this captivating rural scene, figures and landscape remain readily identifiable, but color and rhythm dominate the composition. Weary of the narrative weight that fully fledged figures would hold on the painting, Kandinsky purposely left the characters of Pastorale in a blurry state. By privileging color, form, and movement over direct representation, the artist was aiming for an enhanced encounter with the work, one prompting a profound and spiritual response in the viewer. The year 1911 was important for Kandinsky, as he founded with Franz Marc the group Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) in Munich, and his canonical treatise Uber das Geistige in der Kunst.

    "description": "\nDescription\nDuring the early years of the twentieth century, a back-to-nature movement swept Germany. Artists collectives and nudist colonies sprung up in agricultural areas in the conviction that a return to the land would rejuvenate what was perceived to be an increasingly secularized, materialistic society. A seminarian and philosophy student turned artist, Franz Marc found this nature-oriented quest for spiritual redemption inspiring. His vision of nature was pantheistic; he believed that animals possessed a certain godliness that men had long since lost. People with their lack of piety, especially men, never touched my true feelings, he wrote in 1915. But animals with their virginal sense of life awakened all that was good in me. By 1907 he devoted himself almost exclusively to the representation of animals in nature. To complement this imagery, through which he expressed his spiritual ideals, Marc developed a theory of color Symbolism. His efforts to evoke metaphysical realms through specific color combinations and contrasts were similar to those of Vasily Kandinsky, with whom, in 1911, he founded the Blue Rider, a loose confederation of artists devoted to the expression of inner states.For Marc, different hues evoked gender stereotypes: yellow, a gentle, cheerful and sensual color, symbolized femininity, while blue, representing the spiritual and intellectual, symbolized masculinity. Marcs color theories and biography have been used by art historian Mark Rosenthal to interpret Yellow Cow. The frolicking yellow cow, as a symbol of the female principle, may be a veiled depiction of Maria Franck, whom Marc married in 1911. Extending this reading, Rosenthal sees the triangular blue mountains in the background as Marcs abstract self-portrait, thereby making this painting into a private wedding picture. Not all of Marcs paintings of animals are so sanguine, however. He often depicted innocent creatures in ominous scenes. Painted in 1913, The Unfortunate Land of Tyrol reflects the desolation caused by the Balkan Wars and their anticipation of pan-European battle; an Austro-Hungarian border sign included in the lower-left portion of the canvas indicates the vulnerability of this province. The cemetery and emaciated horses portend doom, but Marcs faith in the ultimate goodness of nature and the regenerative potential of war prevails: the rainbow and bird with outstretched wings reflect a promise of redemption through struggle.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nLike The Accordionist in the collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, The Poet was painted during the summer of 1911, when Pablo Picasso was working in close association with Georges Braque in the French Pyrenees town of Ceret. Similar in style and composition to Braques contemporaneous Man with a Guitar (Collection The Museum of Modern Art, New York), this canvas epitomizes the moment in the development of Analytic Cubism when the degree of abstraction was so extreme that objects in the painting are almost unrecognizable.As the title indicates, it is the human form that has been visually dissected and reconstructed as an architecture of rectilinear and curvilinear elements. Despite the elusiveness of the visual clues, the viewer can detect a densely articulated central pyramidal figure fused coloristically and texturally with the less detailed ground. The small circle at the upper center of the canvas penetrated by the acme of a triangular plane becomes an eye when associated with the longer, broader plane of a possible nose and the crescents of a probable mustache. Once this recognition occurs, a complete image can be reconstituted by the inference of chin, pipe, neck, attenuated torso, elbows, and chair arms.Picasso presents multiple views of each object, as if he had moved around it, and synthesizes them into a single compound image. The fragmentation of the image encourages a reading of abstract rather than representational form. The imagined volumes of figure and object dissolve into non-objective organizations of line, plane, light, and color. Interpenetrating facets of forms floating in a shallow, indeterminate space are defined and shaded by luminous, hatched, almost Neo-Impressionist brushstrokes. The continuity of certain lines through these facets creates an illusion of a system of larger planes that also float in this indefinite space yet are securely anchored within an architectonic structure. The chromatic sobriety characteristic of works by Picasso and Braque of this period corresponds with the cerebral nature of the issues they address.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAfter Marc Chagall moved to Paris from Russia in 1910, his paintings quickly came to reflect the latest avant-garde styles. In Paris Through the Window, Chagalls debt to the Orphic Cubism of his colleague Robert Delaunay is clear in the semitransparent overlapping planes of vivid color in the sky above the city. The Eiffel Tower, which appears in the cityscape, was also a frequent subject in Delaunays work. For both artists it served as a metaphor for Paris and perhaps modernity itself. Chagalls parachutist might also refer to contemporary experience, since the first successful jump occurred in 1912. Other motifs suggest the artists native Vitebsk. This painting is an enlarged version of a window view in a self-portrait painted one year earlier, in which the artist contrasted his birthplace with Paris. The Janus figure in Paris Through the Window has been read as the artist looking at once westward to his new home in France and eastward to Russia. Chagall, however, refused literal interpretations of his paintings, and it is perhaps best to think of them as lyrical evocations, similar to the allusive plastic poetry of the artists friends Blaise Cendrars (who named this canvas) and Guillaume Apollinaire.Years after Chagall painted The Soldier Drinks he stated that it developed from his memory of tsarist soldiers who were billeted with families during the 190405 Russo-Japanese war. The enlisted man in the picture, with his right thumb pointing out the window and his left index finger pointing to the cup, is similar to the two-faced man in Paris Through the Window in that both figuratively mediate between dual worldsinterior versus exterior space, past and present, the imaginary and the real. In paintings such as these it is clear that the artist preferred the life of the mind, memory, and magical Symbolism over realistic representation.In Green Violinist Chagall evoked his homeland. The artists nostalgia for his own work was another impetus in creating this painting, which is based on earlier versions of the same subject. His cultural and religious legacy is illuminated by the figure of the violinist dancing in a rustic village. The Chabad Hasidim of Chagalls childhood believed it possible to achieve communion with God through music and dance, and the fiddler was a vital presence in ceremonies and festivals.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThis painting, which Marcel Duchamp identified as a self-portrait, was probably begun during December of 1911 in Neuilly, while he was exploring ideas for the controversial Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 of 1912. In Nude (Study), Sad Young Man on a Train his transitory though acute interest in Cubism is manifested in the subdued palette, emphasis on the flat surface of the picture plane, and in the subordination of representational fidelity to the demands of the abstract composition.Duchamps primary concern in this painting is the depiction of two movements, that of the train in which we observe the young man smoking and that of the lurching figure itself. The forward motion of the train is suggested by the multiplication of the lines and volumes of the figure, a semitransparent form through which we can see windows, themselves transparent and presumably presenting a blurred, moving landscape. The independent sideways motion of the figure is represented by a directionally contrary series of repetitions. These two series of replications suggest the multiple images of chronophotography, which Duchamp acknowledged as an influence, and the related ideas of the Italian Futurists, of which he was at least aware by this time. Here he uses the device not only to illustrate movement, but also to integrate the young man with his murky surroundings, which with his swaying, drooping pose contribute to the air of melancholy. Shortly after the execution of this and similar works, Duchamp lost interest in Cubism and developed his eccentric vocabulary of mechanomorphic elements that foreshadowed aspects of Dada.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

That year marked the culmination of Analytic Cubism in the work of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque as well as the maturation of Fernand Legers idiosyncratic Cubist style, as manifested in his lively painting The Smokers. All three artists were inspired by Paul Cezanne in their quest for a means by which to accurately describe three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional canvas. By breaking the represented figures or items into series of splintered planes and rendering them againstor withina similarly faceted background, they created an entirely integrated space in which field and object interpenetrate one another. Of the three painters, Leger developed a vocabulary of more precisely delineated formshis fragmented units are larger, arcs predominate, and color prevails.In both The Smokers and Nude Model in the Studio the curving, overlapping planes describe the corporeal forms of each paintings subject while articulating an allover, rhythmically patterned surface. The resulting oscillation between volumetric body and dynamic space owes as much to Futurist aesthetics as to Analytic Cubism. By 1913 Leger had pushed his abstracting grammar to its logical extreme in a series of nonobjective paintings entitled Contrast of Forms. Premised on the visual disparity between discrete geometric volumes, the series presents assorted calibrations of cylindrical, cubic, and planar units. As variations on a theme, each composition of alternating solids and voids offers a different play of light and shadow. The Guggenheims canvas Contrast of Forms accentuates the linear armature and abbreviated modeling of the shifting geometric shapes. With these thoroughly abstract images, Legers explorations of the Cubist idiom approached those of Robert Delaunay, whose Simultaneous Windows and brilliantly colored circular motifs of 1913 neared complete detachment from empirical reality. For Leger, however, this foray into total nonobjectivity was only temporary, as he would soon revive his penchant for figurative subjects.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAccording to Constantin Brancusi's own testimony, his preoccupation with the image of the bird as a plastic form began as early as 1910. With the theme of the Maiastra (191018), he initiated a series of about thirty sculptures of birds.The word maiastra means \"master\" or \"chief\" in Brancusi's native Romanian, but the title refers specifically to a magically beneficent, dazzlingly plumed bird in Romanian folklore. Brancusi's mystical inclinations and his deeply rooted interest in peasant superstition make the motif an apt one. The golden plumage of the Maiastra is expressed in the reflective surface of the bronze; the bird's restorative song seems to issue from within the monumental puffed chest, through the arched neck, out of the open beak. The heraldic, geometric aspect of the figure contrasts with details such as the inconsistent size of the eyes, the distortion of the beak aperture, and the cocking of the head slightly to one side. The elevation of the bird on a saw-tooth base lends it the illusion of perching. The subtle tapering of form, the relationship of curved to hard-edge surfaces, and the changes of axis tune the sculpture so finely that the slightest alteration from version to version reflects a crucial decision in Brancusi's development of the theme.Seven other versions of Maiastra have been identified and located: three are marble and four bronze. The Peggy Guggenheim example apparently was cast from a reworked plaster (now lost but visible in a 1955 photograph of Brancusi's studio).1 This was probably also the source for the almost identical cast in the collection of the Des Moines Art Center.Lucy Flint1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nWhen Constantin Brancusi moved to Paris from his native Romania in 1904, he was introduced to Auguste Rodin, the French master sculptor who was then at the height of his career. He invited Brancusi to join his atelier as an apprentice, but the younger artistwith the confidence, stubbornness, and independence of youthdeclined, claiming that \"nothing grows in the shade of a tall tree.\" Brancusi rejected Rodin's 19th-century emphasis on theatricality and accumulation of detail in favor of radical simplification and abbreviation; he suppressed all decoration and explicit narrative referents in an effort to create pure and resonant forms. His goal was to capture the essence of his subjectswhich included birds in flight, fish, penguins, and a kissing coupleand render them visible with minimal formal means.Brancusi often depicted the human head, another favorite subject, as a unitary ovoid shape separate from the body. When placed on its side, it evokes images of repose. Some of Brancusi's streamlined oval heads, whose forms recall Indian fertility sculptures in their fusion of egglike and phallic shapes, suggest the miracle of creation.Brancusi's marble Muse (La muse, 1912) is a subtle monument to the aesthetic act and to the myth that woman is its inspiration. The finely chiseled and smoothly honed head is poised atop a sinuous neck, the curve of which is counterbalanced by a fragmentary arm pressed against the ear. The facial features, although barely articulated, embody the proportions of classical beauty. As in the sculptor's Mlle Pogany, also of 1912, the subject's hair is coiffed in a bun at the base of the neck. But while Mlle Pogany is the image of a particular woman, The Muse is the embodiment of an ideal.Nancy Spector\n",

Characteristic of this period are the oval format, which frees the canvas from the stringencies of corners, the appearance of letters within the image, and the use of imitation wood grain as trompe loeil (a technique Georges Braque introduced into the Cubist repertory). The image is paler and less strongly articulated than that of Pablo Picassos The Poet of the previous summer; the structure of planes is more compact and produces a shallower picture space. The planes, because they are more consistently parallel to the picture plane than before, suggest the flat surfaces of papier colle. Braques incorporation of sand into certain areas of his pigment, an innovation of this transitional period, enhances the differentiation of surfaces created by the variations of brushstrokes and increases the subtleties of coloration. The use of sand accords with Braques conviction that tactile qualities define space. Despite this emphasis on materiality the image remains evanescent. The paradoxical combination of tangible presence and elusive, palpitating abstraction is embodied in the contrasting handling of clarinet and guitar: the clarinet is shown almost complete, the guitar is fragmented into pieces that emerge here and there throughout the composition.Lucy Flint\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nRobert Delaunay chose the view into the ambulatory of the Parisian Gothic church Saint-Severin as the subject of his first series of paintings, in which he charted the modulations of light streaming through the stained-glass windows and the resulting perceptual distortion of the architecture. The subdued palette and the patches of color that fracture the smooth surface of the floor point to the influence of Paul Cezanne as well as to the stylistic elements of Georges Braques early Cubist landscapes. Delaunay said that the Saint-Severin theme in his work marked a period of transition from Cezanne to Cubism.Delaunay explored the developments of Cubist fragmentation more explicitly in his series of paintings of the Eiffel Tower. In these canvases, characteristic of his self-designated destructive phase, the artist presented the tower and surrounding buildings from various perspectives. Delaunay chose a subject that allowed him to indulge his preference for a sense of vast space, atmosphere, and light, while evoking a sign of modernity and progress. Like the soaring vaults of Gothic cathedrals, the Eiffel Tower is a uniquely French symbol of invention and aspiration. Many of Delaunays images of this structure and the surrounding city are views from a window framed by curtains. In Eiffel Tower (painted in 1911, although it bears the date 1910) the buildings bracketing the tower curve like drapery.The artists attraction to windows and window views, linked to the Symbolists use of glass panes as metaphors for the transition from internal to external states, culminated in his Simultaneous Windows series. (The series derives its name from the French scientist Michel-Eugene Chevreuls theory of simultaneous contrasts of color, which explores how divergent hues are perceived at once.) Delaunay stated that these works began his constructive phase, in which he juxtaposed and overlaid translucent contrasting complementary colors to create a synthetic, harmonic composition. Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a poem about these paintings and coined the word Orphism to describe Delaunays endeavor, which he believed was as independent of descriptive reality as was music (the name derives from Orpheus, the mythological lyre player). Although Simultaneous Windows (2nd Motif, 1st Part) contains a vestigial green profile of the Eiffel Tower, it is one of the artists last salutes to representation before his leap to complete abstraction.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThough Robert Delaunay had virtually discarded representational imagery by the spring of 1912 when he embarked on the Windows theme, vestigial objects endure in this series. Here, as in Simultaneous Windows 2nd Motif, 1st Part (Collection Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York) of the same moment, the centralized ghost of a green Eiffel Tower alludes to his enthusiasm for modern life.Analytic Cubism inspired Delaunays fragmentation of form, oval format, and organization of the pictures space as a grid supporting intersecting planes. However, unlike the monochromatic, tactile planes of Cubism, those of Delaunay are not defined by line and modeling, but by the application of diaphanous, prismatic color. Delaunay wrote in 1913: Line is limitation. Color gives depthnot perspectival, not successive, but simultaneous depthas well as form and movement.1 As in visual perception of the real world, perception of Delaunays painting is initially fragmentary, the eye continually moving from one form to others related by hue, value, tone, shape, or direction. As focus shifts, expands, jumps, and contracts in unending rhythms, one senses the fixed borders of the canvas and the tight interlocking of its contents. Because identification of representational forms is not necessary while the eye moves restlessly, judgments about the relative importance of parts are not made and all elements can be perceived as equally significant. The harmony of the pictorial reality provides an analogy to the concealed harmony of the world. At the left of the canvas Delaunay suggests glass, which, like his chromatic planes, is at once transparent, reflective, insubstantial, and solid. Glass may allude as well to the metaphor of art as a window on reality.Lucy Flint\n",

The rider is featured in many woodcuts, temperas, and oils, from its first appearance in the artists folk-inspired paintings, executed in his native Russia at the turn of the century, to his abstracted landscapes made in Munich during the early 1910s. The horseman was also incorporated into the cover designs for Kandinskys theoretical manifesto of 1911, On the Spiritual in Art, and the contemporaneous Blue Rider Almanac, which he coedited with Franz Marc.In 1909, the year he completed Blue Mountain, Kandinsky painted no less than seven other canvases with images of riders. In that year his style became increasingly abstract and expressionistic and his thematic concerns shifted from the portrayal of natural events to apocalyptic narratives. By 1910 many of the artists abstract canvases shared a common literary source, the Revelation of Saint John the Divine; the rider came to signify the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, who will bring epic destruction after which the world will be redeemed. In both Sketch for Composition II and Improvisation 28 (second version) Kandinsky depictedthrough highly schematized meanscataclysmic events on one side of the canvas and the paradise of spiritual salvation on the other. In the latter painting, for instance, images of a boat and waves (signaling the global deluge), a serpent, and, perhaps, cannons emerge on the left, while an embracing couple, shining sun, and celebratory candles appear on the right.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMikhail Larionov was not only a painter but also an organizer of exhibitions, a stylistic innovator, and the author of three Rayist manifestos. Rayism was a short-lived movement invented by Larionov, who along with his companion Natalia Goncharova, were its primary practitioners. Glass (Steklo, 1912) and other Rayist works first appeared in the exhibition Mir iskusstva (World of Art), which opened in Moscow in December 1912 and traveled to St. Petersburg and Kiev in 1913. In 1913, Larionov published a essay entitled \"Luchistskaya zhivopis\" (\"Rayist Painting\") in which he outlined his theoriesbased on ideas about vision and perceptionfor painting \"the sum of rays reflected from the object.\"1 In his conceptualization, Rayist painting, by capturing the play of light on its subject, mimics the act of seeing: \"Rayism erases the barriers that exist between the picture's surface and nature.\" Translating light rays into echoing lines of color, Rayism shares Cubism's analysis of form, Futurism's emphasis on dynamism, and Orphism's exploration of optic principles.\nLarionov considered Glass to have been his first fully Rayist work. The 1909 date inscribed on the surface of this canvas is thought to have been added by the artist in 1914 when the work was brought to Paris for exhibition. The work depicts five tumblers, a goblet, and two bottles such that their essential forms are retained, and lines and vectors of color represent light refracted by the surface of these vessels. The Russian title, Steklo (glass), refers to the substance glass, rather than to glass as an individual object made from it. As early as 1913, a reviewer of Larionov's and Goncharova's work observed that Larionov was not painting a still life but \"simply 'glass' as a universal condition of glass with all its manifestations and propertiesfragility, ease in breaking, sharpness, transparency, brittleness, ability to make sounds, i.e., the sum of all the sensations, obtainable from glass.\"\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe paintings of the Russian avant-garde have, in general, elicited two types of interpretation: one focuses on issues of technique and style; the other concentrates on social and political issues. The former method is usually applied to Kazimir Malevichs early paintings, grounded as they are in the forms of Cubism, Futurism, and other contemporaneous art movements; the latter largely avoids Malevich in favor of more politically engaged artists such as El Lissitzky, Aleksandr Rodchenko, and Vladimir Tatlin.From the formalists standpoint, Morning in the Village after Snowstorm is, in its mastery of complex colors and shapes, a perfect example of the newly created Russian style, Cubo-Futurism. The figures have been called a continuation of the genre types Malevich portrayed in his Neo-primitive paintings, their depiction seemingly reliant on Fernand Legers work, which Malevich could have known from an exhibition in Moscow in February 1912 or through reproductions. This phase in Malevichs career has been seen as his formidable stopover on his journey toward abstraction and the development of Suprematism.But to ignore the political and social dimensions of Malevichs art would be a disservice. Malevich came from humble circumstances and it is clear in autobiographical accounts that vivid memories of his country childhood compensated for his lack of a formal art education. Morning in the Village after Snowstorm demonstrates that his hard-won skills as a sophisticated painter were rooted in an unmistakably Russian experience. If art can be said to augur the future, then Malevichs repeated decisionon the brink of the October Revolutionto depict peasants cannot have been merely coincidental.Cornelia Lauf\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nArt historian and critic Michel Seuphor proclaimed that 1912 was perhaps the most beautiful date in the whole history of painting in France. That year marked the culmination of Analytic Cubism in the work of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque as well as the maturation of Fernand Legers idiosyncratic Cubist style, as manifested in his lively painting The Smokers. All three artists were inspired by Paul Cezanne in their quest for a means by which to accurately describe three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional canvas. By breaking the represented figures or items into series of splintered planes and rendering them againstor withina similarly faceted background, they created an entirely integrated space in which field and object interpenetrate one another. Of the three painters, Leger developed a vocabulary of more precisely delineated formshis fragmented units are larger, arcs predominate, and color prevails.In both The Smokers and Nude Model in the Studio the curving, overlapping planes describe the corporeal forms of each paintings subject while articulating an allover, rhythmically patterned surface. The resulting oscillation between volumetric body and dynamic space owes as much to Futurist aesthetics as to Analytic Cubism. By 1913 Leger had pushed his abstracting grammar to its logical extreme in a series of nonobjective paintings entitled Contrast of Forms. Premised on the visual disparity between discrete geometric volumes, the series presents assorted calibrations of cylindrical, cubic, and planar units. As variations on a theme, each composition of alternating solids and voids offers a different play of light and shadow. The Guggenheims canvas Contrast of Forms accentuates the linear armature and abbreviated modeling of the shifting geometric shapes. With these thoroughly abstract images, Legers explorations of the Cubist idiom approached those of Robert Delaunay, whose Simultaneous Windows and brilliantly colored circular motifs of 1913 neared complete detachment from empirical reality. For Leger, however, this foray into total nonobjectivity was only temporary, as he would soon revive his penchant for figurative subjects.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

Carrousel Pierrot (1913) and Medrano II (191314) are souvenirs of this heady time. None of Archipenko's colleagues would have missed the allusions in these works to the Cirque Medrano (which many artists frequented), the vogue for puppetry, or the jesters in Picasso's paintings. Harlequins and saltimbanques were traditional stand-ins for the artistic persona; they also offered a unique package of shapes and colors for formal resolution. Carrousel Pierrot fits into Archipenko's lifelong fascination with the possibilities of polychromy and the abstract figure in the round. Reminiscing about the origin of Carrousel Pierrot, Archipenko later recalled that he was inspired by a festival where \"dozens of carrousels with horses, swings, gondolas and airplanes imitate the rotation of the earth.\" Medrano II is almost anomalous within Archipenko's oeuvre. Although it relates to the later \"sculpto-paintings\" for its crossover between two disciplines, the work is the only extant example of the theme of a figure in motion, with which Archipenko experimented in two other worksMedrano I (Juggler)",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAfter Marc Chagall moved to Paris from Russia in 1910, his paintings quickly came to reflect the latest avant-garde styles. In Paris Through the Window, Chagalls debt to the Orphic Cubism of his colleague Robert Delaunay is clear in the semitransparent overlapping planes of vivid color in the sky above the city. The Eiffel Tower, which appears in the cityscape, was also a frequent subject in Delaunays work. For both artists it served as a metaphor for Paris and perhaps modernity itself. Chagalls parachutist might also refer to contemporary experience, since the first successful jump occurred in 1912. Other motifs suggest the artists native Vitebsk. This painting is an enlarged version of a window view in a self-portrait painted one year earlier, in which the artist contrasted his birthplace with Paris. The Janus figure in Paris Through the Window has been read as the artist looking at once westward to his new home in France and eastward to Russia. Chagall, however, refused literal interpretations of his paintings, and it is perhaps best to think of them as lyrical evocations, similar to the allusive plastic poetry of the artists friends Blaise Cendrars (who named this canvas) and Guillaume Apollinaire.Years after Chagall painted The Soldier Drinks he stated that it developed from his memory of tsarist soldiers who were billeted with families during the 190405 Russo-Japanese war. The enlisted man in the picture, with his right thumb pointing out the window and his left index finger pointing to the cup, is similar to the two-faced man in Paris Through the Window in that both figuratively mediate between dual worldsinterior versus exterior space, past and present, the imaginary and the real. In paintings such as these it is clear that the artist preferred the life of the mind, memory, and magical Symbolism over realistic representation.In Green Violinist Chagall evoked his homeland. The artists nostalgia for his own work was another impetus in creating this painting, which is based on earlier versions of the same subject. His cultural and religious legacy is illuminated by the figure of the violinist dancing in a rustic village. The Chabad Hasidim of Chagalls childhood believed it possible to achieve communion with God through music and dance, and the fiddler was a vital presence in ceremonies and festivals.Jennifer Blessing\r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nGiorgio de Chiricos enigmatic works of 1911 to 1917 provided a crucial inspiration for the Surrealist painters. The dreamlike atmosphere of his compositions results from irrational perspective, the lack of a unified light source, the elongation of shadows, and a hallucinatory focus on objects. Italian piazzas bounded by arcades or classical facades are transformed into ominously silent and vacant settings for invisible dramas. The absence of event provokes a nostalgic or melancholy mood as if one senses the wake of a momentous incident; if one feels the imminence of an act, a feeling of anxiety ensues.De Chirico remarked that every object has two appearances: one, the current one, which we nearly always see and which is seen by people in general; the other, a spectral or metaphysical appearance beheld only by some individuals in moments of clairvoyance and metaphysical abstraction, as in the case of certain bodies concealed by substances impenetrable by sunlight yet discernible, for instance, by x-ray or other powerful artificial means.1 Traces of concealed human presences appear in the fraught expanse of this work. One is the partly concealed equestrian monument often identified as Carlo Marochettis 1861 statue of King Carlo Alberto in Turin,2 which also appears in the background of de Chiricos The Departure of the Poet of 1914. In addition, in the left foreground, overpainting barely conceals two figures (or statues), one of which resembles a shrouded mythological hero by the 19th-century Swiss painter Arnold Bocklin. The true protagonist, however, is the crenellated tower; in its imposing centrality and rotundity it conveys a virile energy that fills the pictorial space.Lucy Flint1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nNatalia Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov, her collaborator and companion for more than 60 years, experimented with contemporary French stylistic trends before developing a Neo-primitive vocabulary inspired by indigenous Russian folk art. In late 1912 the two artists fashioned a fusion of Cubo-Futurism and Orphism known as Rayism. Cats, painted shortly thereafter, exemplifies the new style.Using intersecting vectors of color to depict refracted light rays, Rayist works recreate the surface play of light on objects. This perceptual approach to painting was based on scientific discoveries concerning the nature of vision, advances that had also influenced Neo-Impressionist color theories, the Cubist analysis of form, and the Futurist emphasis on dynamic lines. The nationalistic strain apparent in Italian Futurist manifestos also pervades Rayist tracts, in which the Russian theory is posited as a unique synthetic achievement of the East. In the preface to the catalogue of her 1913 Moscow retrospective exhibition, Goncharova wrote: For me the East means the creation of new forms, an extending and deepening of the problems of color. This will help me to express contemporaneityits living beautybetter and more vividly.Cats, which appears to represent two black felines with a tabby in between, illustrates the Rayist view that objects may serve as points of departure for explorations on the canvas. Goncharova used darts of color to suggest the effects of light on the cats shiny coats and the way that adjacent surfaces reflect neighboring hues. The dynamic slashes of black and white evoke the energized, machine-inspired compositions of the Futurists.The artists brilliant color recalls Robert Delaunays exuberant depictions of the Eiffel Tower as well as Russian woodblock prints and painted trays. Cats also suggests the richly hued integration of animals and their environment that Franz Marc was developing contemporaneously in his own synthesis of Cubism and Futurism. Yet unlike Marc and other German Expressionist painters, Rayist painters did not seek to express spiritual goals through their art.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nFrom 1908 Vasily Kandinsky often stayed in the town of Murnau in upper Bavaria, where his companion Gabriele Munter bought a house in 1909. The landscapes inspired by these Alpine surroundings developed from the flattened, densely colored views of 1908 to the luminous, antimaterial dream visions of 1913, such as this canvas and the closely related Landscape with Red Spots, No. 1 (Collection Museum Folkwang, Essen).The motif of the church in a landscape recurs often in Kandinskys paintings of 190813. In examples of 190809 the particular design of the Murnau church makes identification possible, though the local topography may not be accurately reflected. By 1911 there is little specifying detail, and the tower, which serves to divide the composition, has taken on a generalized, columnar appearance. In Landscape with Red Spots, No. 2 the tower is replaced by a mysterious elongated vertical form that seems to continue beyond the canvas edge into another realm. Like the nineteenth-century German Romantic painters, Kandinsky presents the landscape as an exalted, spiritualized vision. He achieves the sublimity of the image by freeing color from its descriptive function to reveal its latent expressive content. The chromatic emphasis is on the primary colors, applied thinly over a white ground. The focal point, the red spot that inspires the pictures title, bears out Kandinskys appraisal of red as an expanding color that pulses forward toward the viewer, in contrast to cooler colors, particularly blue, that recede. Kandinsky indicates the naturalistic content of subject matter with abbreviated signs, emphasizing the purely pictorial aspects of color and form, and thus is able to dematerialize the objective world.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

That year marked the culmination of Analytic Cubism in the work of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque as well as the maturation of Fernand Legers idiosyncratic Cubist style, as manifested in his lively painting The Smokers. All three artists were inspired by Paul Cezanne in their quest for a means by which to accurately describe three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional canvas. By breaking the represented figures or items into series of splintered planes and rendering them againstor withina similarly faceted background, they created an entirely integrated space in which field and object interpenetrate one another. Of the three painters, Leger developed a vocabulary of more precisely delineated formshis fragmented units are larger, arcs predominate, and color prevails.In both The Smokers and Nude Model in the Studio the curving, overlapping planes describe the corporeal forms of each paintings subject while articulating an allover, rhythmically patterned surface. The resulting oscillation between volumetric body and dynamic space owes as much to Futurist aesthetics as to Analytic Cubism. By 1913 Leger had pushed his abstracting grammar to its logical extreme in a series of nonobjective paintings entitled Contrast of Forms. Premised on the visual disparity between discrete geometric volumes, the series presents assorted calibrations of cylindrical, cubic, and planar units. As variations on a theme, each composition of alternating solids and voids offers a different play of light and shadow. The Guggenheims canvas Contrast of Forms accentuates the linear armature and abbreviated modeling of the shifting geometric shapes. With these thoroughly abstract images, Legers explorations of the Cubist idiom approached those of Robert Delaunay, whose Simultaneous Windows and brilliantly colored circular motifs of 1913 neared complete detachment from empirical reality. For Leger, however, this foray into total nonobjectivity was only temporary, as he would soon revive his penchant for figurative subjects.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nLike Vasily Kandinsky and other artists associated with Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), Franz Marc searched for ways to reflect inner spiritual and emotional states through art. Marcs approach was oriented toward nature, founded on the pantheistic belief that animals possessed a certain godliness that men had long since lost. He completed Stables, the last major work based on his favorite subject, the horse, by the end of 1913. During the course of the year, Marc had become increasingly interested in abstract pictorial modes to express universal aspects of existence. Rather than portraying the natural world from the point of view of the individual animal, Marc now saw his subjects as part of a larger unified field and treated them in terms of the overall structure of the composition. In Stables, the images of horse and stables are almost indistinguishable. The artist arranged a group of five red, blue, and white horses within a framework of parallel and crossing diagonals. Massed on the picture plane, the horses are transformed into flat colored shapes. The curvilinear patterns of the animals tails and the shifting planes of vivid, light-filled colors suggest the influence of the Futurists and Robert Delaunay, whom Marc had met during a trip to Paris in 1912.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nDuring the early years of the twentieth century, a back-to-nature movement swept Germany. Artists collectives and nudist colonies sprung up in agricultural areas in the conviction that a return to the land would rejuvenate what was perceived to be an increasingly secularized, materialistic society. A seminarian and philosophy student turned artist, Franz Marc found this nature-oriented quest for spiritual redemption inspiring. His vision of nature was pantheistic; he believed that animals possessed a certain godliness that men had long since lost. People with their lack of piety, especially men, never touched my true feelings, he wrote in 1915. But animals with their virginal sense of life awakened all that was good in me. By 1907 he devoted himself almost exclusively to the representation of animals in nature. To complement this imagery, through which he expressed his spiritual ideals, Marc developed a theory of color Symbolism. His efforts to evoke metaphysical realms through specific color combinations and contrasts were similar to those of Vasily Kandinsky, with whom, in 1911, he founded the Blue Rider, a loose confederation of artists devoted to the expression of inner states.For Marc, different hues evoked gender stereotypes: yellow, a gentle, cheerful and sensual color, symbolized femininity, while blue, representing the spiritual and intellectual, symbolized masculinity. Marcs color theories and biography have been used by art historian Mark Rosenthal to interpret Yellow Cow. The frolicking yellow cow, as a symbol of the female principle, may be a veiled depiction of Maria Franck, whom Marc married in 1911. Extending this reading, Rosenthal sees the triangular blue mountains in the background as Marcs abstract self-portrait, thereby making this painting into a private wedding picture. Not all of Marcs paintings of animals are so sanguine, however. He often depicted innocent creatures in ominous scenes. Painted in 1913, The Unfortunate Land of Tyrol reflects the desolation caused by the Balkan Wars and their anticipation of pan-European battle; an Austro-Hungarian border sign included in the lower-left portion of the canvas indicates the vulnerability of this province. The cemetery and emaciated horses portend doom, but Marcs faith in the ultimate goodness of nature and the regenerative potential of war prevails: the rainbow and bird with outstretched wings reflect a promise of redemption through struggle.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

Tableau No. 2/Composition No. VII, painted a year after his arrival in 1912, exemplifies Mondrians regard for the new technique. With a procedure indebted to high Analytic Cubism, Mondrian broke down his motifin this case a treeinto a scaffolding of interlocking black lines and planes of color; furthermore, his palette of close-valued ocher and gray tones resembles Cubist canvases. Yet Mondrian went beyond the Parisian Cubists degree of abstraction: his subjects are less recognizable, in part because he eschewed any suggestion of volume, and, unlike the Cubists, who rooted their compositions at the bottom of the canvas in order to depict a figure subject to gravity, Mondrians scaffolding fades at the paintings edges. In works such as Composition 8, based on studies of Parisian building facades, Mondrian went even further in his refusal of illusionism and the representation of volume.During the war years, Mondrian continued to move toward greater abstraction, rejecting diagonal lines and decreasing his reliance on his favored subjectstrees, seascapes, and architecture. Composition, which developed from studies of a church, is among the last of his works that can be traced to an observable source. Canvases like this make it clear that Mondrians interest lay foremost in coming to terms with the two-dimensionality of the painted surface. For this work, the artist designed a strip frame (now lost), which he said prevented the sensation of depth created by traditional carved frames.The inexorable consistency and internal logic of his solutions hint at a larger conceptual principle, which is outlined in great depth in the artists extensive theoretical writings. Like many pioneers of abstraction, Mondrians impetus was largely spiritual. He aimed to distill the real world to its pure essence, to represent the dichotomies of the universe in eternal tension. To achieve this, he privileged certain principlesstability, universality, and spiritualitythrough the yin/yang balancing of horizontal and vertical strokes. His philosophical framework was grounded in the Neoplatonic and Tantric-inspired texts of authors connected to the Theosophical Society, the Dutch branch of which had counted Mondrian as a member since 1909.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

Carrousel Pierrot (1913) and Medrano II (191314) are souvenirs of this heady time. None of Archipenko's colleagues would have missed the allusions in these works to the Cirque Medrano (which many artists frequented), the vogue for puppetry, or the jesters in Picasso's paintings. Harlequins and saltimbanques were traditional stand-ins for the artistic persona; they also offered a unique package of shapes and colors for formal resolution. Carrousel Pierrot fits into Archipenko's lifelong fascination with the possibilities of polychromy and the abstract figure in the round. Reminiscing about the origin of Carrousel Pierrot, Archipenko later recalled that he was inspired by a festival where \"dozens of carrousels with horses, swings, gondolas and airplanes imitate the rotation of the earth.\" Medrano II is almost anomalous within Archipenko's oeuvre. Although it relates to the later \"sculpto-paintings\" for its crossover between two disciplines, the work is the only extant example of the theme of a figure in motion, with which Archipenko experimented in two other worksMedrano I (Juggler)",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn late 1912 to early 1913 Giacomo Balla turned from a depiction of the splintering of light to the exploration of movement and, more specifically, the speed of racing automobiles. This led to an important series of studies in 191314. The choice of automobile as symbol of abstract speed recalls Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's notorious statement in his first Futurist manifesto, published on February 20, 1909, in Le Figaro in Paris, only a decade after the first Italian car was manufactured: \"The world's splendor has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed. . . . A roaring automobile . . . that seems to run on shrapnel, is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace.\"\nIt has been proposed that Abstract Speed + Sound (191314) was the central section of a narrative triptych suggesting the alteration of landscape by the passage of a car through the atmosphere.1 The related Abstract Speed (Velocita + paesaggio, 1913) and Abstract SpeedThe Car Has Passed (1913) would have been the flanking panels. Indications of sky and a single landscape are present in the three paintings; the interpretation of fragmented evocations of the car's speed varies from panel to panel. The Peggy Guggenheim work is distinguished by crisscross motifs, representing sound, and a multiplication of the number of lines and planes.\nThe original frames of all three panels were painted with continuations of the forms and colors of the compositions, implying the overflow of the paintings' reality into the spectator's own space. Many other studies and variations by Balla on the theme of a moving automobile in the same landscape exist.Lucy Flint1.

Recurrent motifs in the sequence are the plaster bust with dark glasses, the mannequin, and the fish mold on an obelisk. These objects, bearing no evident relationships to one another, are compressed here into a narrow vertical format that creates a claustrophobic and enigmatic space.As in The Red Tower, the use of inanimate forms imitating or alluding to human beings has complex ramifications. The sculpture at the lower left is a painted representation of a plaster cast from a stone, marble, or metal bust by an imaginary, or at present unidentified, sculptor. The character portrayed could be mythological, historical, symbolical, or fictional. The fish is a charcoal drawing of a metal mold that could produce a baked cast of a fish made with an actual fish. The fish has additional connotations as a religious symbol, and the hooklike graphic sign toward which its gaping mouth is directed has its own cryptic allusiveness. The mannequin is a simplified cloth cast of a human figurea mold on which clothing is shaped to conform to the contours of a person. Each object, though treated as solid and static, dissolves in multiple significations and paradoxes. Such amalgams of elusive meaning in Giorgio de Chiricos strangely intense objects compelled the attention of the Surrealists.Lucy Flint\r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nRaymond Duchamp-Villon began work on the plaster original of The Horse, a composite image of an animal and machine, in 1914, finishing it on leaves from military duty in the fall. It was preceded by numerous sketches and by several other versions initiated in 1913. The original conception did not include the machine and was relatively naturalistic, as is evident in the early states of the small Horse and Rider of 1914. Duchamp-Villon then developed an increasingly dynamic, smooth-surfaced, and geometric synthesis of horse and machine. The Peggy Guggenheim version is highly abstract and parts of the horses physiognomy are replaced by machine elements. Nonetheless, echoes of the original pose remain. As in the second state of Horse and Rider (Collection Judith Riklis, New York), the animal appears to be gathering its hooves, summoning strength to jump. Duchamp-Villon closely observed the dynamics of the movement of horses during his experience in the cavalry; he also studied the subject in the late nineteenth-century photographic experiments of Eadweard Muybridge and Etienne-Jules Marey.With a handful of other sculptors, such as Alexander Archipenko, Umberto Boccioni, and Constantin Brancusi, Duchamp-Villon overturned conventional representation of form to suggest instead its inner forces. He associated these forces with the energy of the machine. The visual movement of the pistons, wheels, and shafts of this sculpture turns a creature of nature into a poised mechanical dynamo. The fusion of the horse, traditional symbol of power, and the machine that was replacing it reflects the emerging awareness of the new technological age.The entire series was cast in bronze after the artists death.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

These collaged papers cover the entire surface of the canvas, simultaneously forming an abstract composition and serving as a multilayered support for naturalistic details.The dynamism of the picture derives from the tension between horizontals, verticals, and thrusting diagonals. Gris presents the table as if it were viewed from several vantage points at once, demonstrating that a diagonal can be understood as a horizontal perceived from an oblique angle, and also suggesting the movement of the observer or artist around objects. The telescoping of a number of viewpoints in a single image produces the illusion of a spatial dislocation of the objects themselves. Dissected parts of the bottle of rum, recognizable by correspondence of shape or by labeling, float beside, below, or above the drawing of the complete bottle. These paper cutouts, at once more tangible and more fragmented than the shadowy outline, confuse ones perceptions of the bottles presence.Gris confounds expectations of the nature of materials.

In their manifesto, they declared: We wish to establish our freedom of action and life against well-established older forces. Taking their cue from the French Post-Impressionists and Fauves, they chose their subjects from the world around them, depicting city life, friends, landscapes, and music halls. Disparaging the studied classicism of academic painting, they filled their art with emotional energy rendered in acrid colors and with frenzied brushstrokes, thus defining the signature style of German Expressionism.Gerda, Half-Length Portrait was painted after Kirchner had moved to Berlin and Die Brucke had disbanded. The stylized pose and angularity of the figure set within a radically foreshortened background are typical of the artists mature style. The rough-hewn features of her face also call to mind Kirchners interest in African masks. The intensity of the composition, the combined result of a harsh palette and sketchlike drawing, is made more dynamic by the highly abstract space surrounding the figure. The seductive, confrontational pose of the subject, the dancer Gerda Schilling (who was the older sister of the artists future common-law wife), has an affinity with Kirchners psychologically charged Berlin streetscapes of prostitutes and bourgeois life.After World War I Kirchner suffered from medical problems that occasioned his resettlement to the Swiss countryside. There, living in relative seclusion, he shifted to painting landscapes and other nature scenes invested with a mystical aura. In 1938 (the year after the Nazis included his work in the Entartete Kunst [Degenerate Art] exhibition), despondent and in failing health, Kirchner took his own life.Matthew Drutt\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWhen Mondrian saw Cubist paintings by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso at a 1911 exhibition in Amsterdam, he was inspired to go to Paris. Tableau No. 2/Composition No. VII, painted a year after his arrival in 1912, exemplifies Mondrians regard for the new technique. With a procedure indebted to high Analytic Cubism, Mondrian broke down his motifin this case a treeinto a scaffolding of interlocking black lines and planes of color; furthermore, his palette of close-valued ocher and gray tones resembles Cubist canvases. Yet Mondrian went beyond the Parisian Cubists degree of abstraction: his subjects are less recognizable, in part because he eschewed any suggestion of volume, and, unlike the Cubists, who rooted their compositions at the bottom of the canvas in order to depict a figure subject to gravity, Mondrians scaffolding fades at the paintings edges. In works such as Composition 8, based on studies of Parisian building facades, Mondrian went even further in his refusal of illusionism and the representation of volume.During the war years, Mondrian continued to move toward greater abstraction, rejecting diagonal lines and decreasing his reliance on his favored subjectstrees, seascapes, and architecture. Composition, which developed from studies of a church, is among the last of his works that can be traced to an observable source. Canvases like this make it clear that Mondrians interest lay foremost in coming to terms with the two-dimensionality of the painted surface. For this work, the artist designed a strip frame (now lost), which he said prevented the sensation of depth created by traditional carved frames.The inexorable consistency and internal logic of his solutions hint at a larger conceptual principle, which is outlined in great depth in the artists extensive theoretical writings. Like many pioneers of abstraction, Mondrians impetus was largely spiritual. He aimed to distill the real world to its pure essence, to represent the dichotomies of the universe in eternal tension. To achieve this, he privileged certain principlesstability, universality, and spiritualitythrough the yin/yang balancing of horizontal and vertical strokes. His philosophical framework was grounded in the Neoplatonic and Tantric-inspired texts of authors connected to the Theosophical Society, the Dutch branch of which had counted Mondrian as a member since 1909.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nPiet Mondrian first treated the theme of the sea in naturalistic works of 190911, during lengthy sojourns in the village of Domburg on the coast of Dutch Zeeland. He assimilated and adapted the Cubism of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in Paris soon after his arrival there in the winter of 191112. He returned to the Netherlands in the summer of 1914 and probably in the following war years worked on the studies of the sea that culminated in the Pier and Ocean paintings of 1917.The oval format and grid structure used in these works are devices derived from Cubism. They serve respectively to resolve the problem of the compositional interference of the corners and to organize and unify the pictures elements. For Mondrian the horizontal-vertical arrangement did not have an exclusively pictorial function, as it did for the Cubists, but carried mystical implications. He viewed the horizontal and vertical as basic oppositional principles that could interact to produce a union symbolizing a state of universal harmony.Although Mondrians source exists in the natural world, in the motion of waves and their contact with breakwaters, the signs for this source have been reduced to their most essential pictorial form. The strokes are determined by their structural function rather than their descriptive potential, and there is no sense of perspectival recession despite the atmospheric texture of the gouache highlighting. This highlighting evokes the reflection of light on water and also defines planar surfaces. As Mondrian developed the theories of Neo-Plasticism, these suggestions of natural phenomena disappeared.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAfter fragmenting representational form almost to the point of extinction in 1911, the following year Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque reintroduced more legible imagery, usually derived from the environment of studio or cafe. Without abandoning all devices of Analytic Cubism, they developed a new idiom, referred to as Synthetic Cubism, in which they built their compositions with broader, flatter, and chromatically more varied planes. In the summer of 1912 Braque produced the first papier colle, in which cut paper is glued to the support and used as a compositional element. In the present example Picassos pasted papers include printed materiala piece of wallpaper and the January 1, 1914, issue of Lacerba, a Futurist magazine founded in Florence in 1913. These elements mimic their functions in the external world and therefore introduce a new level of reality into the picture. The printed papers appear to be integrated into the pictorial space rather than lying flat on the surface. A transparent plane outlined in chalk appears to penetrate the newspaper and the guitar seems to cast a shadow on it; the actual physical presence of the wallpaper is similarly contradicted by the addition of drawing.The treatment of other collaged papers multiplies meaning. In the case of the pipe or table leg, the cutout itself defines the contour of the object and is modeled accordingly with chalk. Penciled indications of other objects, such as the guitar or glass, ignore the shape of the pasted paper, which acts as both a support and a compositional element. The opacity of the collage materials is refuted and the transparency of the object depicted is upheld when Picasso discloses parts of the guitar behind the glass. On the other hand, a piece of Lacerba remains visible through the guitar, which in reality is opaque. Not only does each object have a multiple nature, but its relations in space to other objects are changeable and contradictory. The table assuredly occupies a space between the wall and the picture plane; its collaged corner overlaps a portion of wallpaper and its visible leg obscures part of a baseboard molding. Yet the depth of this space is indeterminate, as the tabletop has reared up so that it is parallel to the picture plane. The respective situations in space of the still-life subjects are equally equivocalthe silhouette of the bottle of Vieux Marc simultaneously obscures and is obscured by the guitar.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nToward the end of 1913, after he left Paris for Pienza and Rome, Gino Severini traveled to coastal Anzio for reasons of health. It was after arriving there that he executed Sea=Dancer. This painting, in which the sea and a figure are equated, illustrates his notions of plastic analogies as outlined in a manifesto he prepared for his solo exhibition at the Marlborough Gallery in London in 1913. According to Severini, the environment is optically determined and hence fluid, and the human figure is merely a part, albeit an inseparable part, of that metamorphic reality. In this canvas and others the cadences of the swirling motion of the dance and the dancers costume are compared with those of the seas movement. The large curling planes are stippled with brilliant staccato dabs of paint that cause all surfaces to vibrate as if with light. As in many other Futurist paintings, the image spills over onto the frame. The divisionist brushstroke derives from Giacomo Balla and ultimately from the Neo-Impressionists, particularly Georges Seurat. Works such as Sea=Dancer may have a specific source in Seurats Le Chahut of 188990.1The play of cylindrical and flat planes in this painting brings to mind the contemporaneous Cubism of Fernand Leger, though the color is closer to the prismatic hues of Robert Delaunay. However, the absence of outline and the dissolution of volume distinguish Severinis work. During this period Severinis analogies of forms divest objects of their usual identities; later in 1914 he would produce entirely non-objective compositions.Lucy Flint1. Alfred H.

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe 1911 Salon des Independantsin which Robert Delaunay, Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, and others presented paintings in an idiom that Guillaume Apollinaire would later term Cubistwas met with derision by critics and public alike. In an effort to deflect the outcry that followed, Gleizes and Metzinger published Du Cubisme in 1912. This important early treatise on Cubism stressed a conceptual approach to the translation of objects into the plastic realm, one in which surface appearances are sacrificed to the processes of thought.Unlike Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, who historically have been promoted as the main arbiters of Cubism, Gleizes abandoned Cubisms first, analytic phase and strove to create a synthetic art, one incorporating the social values that had preoccupied him since the days of the Abbaye de Creteil, a utopian community of artists and writers he helped establish in 1906. In rejecting what he perceived as Picassos and Braques Impressionism of form and dissection of the subject, Gleizes embraced a style that attempted to capture the subject in its absolute order and truth. With its broad, overlapping planes of brilliant color, Portrait of an Army Doctor embodies the second synthetic phase of Cubism.This painting dates from 191415, during which time Gleizes served a second stint in the military. While Gleizes was stationed in Toul, his commanding officeran admirer of his workmade arrangements so that Gleizes could continue to paint while fulfilling his military obligation. That at least eight studies for the painting survive is no surprise, given that Gleizess artistic inclinations were accommodated by the regimental surgeon, in whose home he painted. With ample opportunity to observe and study his subject, Gleizes worked through these studies to resolve the compositional harmony of the painting, inflecting an otherwise staid genre with a circular rhythm. Gleizes experienced increasing frustration toward the end of the 1910s as the avant-garde embraced Dada, an anarchic enterprise that ran counter to his quest for social values in art. He began to focus increasingly on the compositional harmonies of his subjectsevident early on in works such as Portrait of an Army Doctorin the belief that rhythmic harmonies were more universal and hence superior to subjective responses. In the early 1930s, together with Jean Arp, Delaunay, Jean Helion, and others, he founded the Abstraction-Creation group in order to advance pure abstraction. Tellingly, his works from the 1930s on promote plastic values to the exclusion of discernible subject matter, resulting in lyric explorations of pure form and color. J. Fiona Ragheb\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nUmberto Boccioni turned to sculpture in 1912 after publishing his manifesto on the subject on April 11 of that year. The Futurist aesthetic platform as articulated in this document advocates the use of various materials in a single work, the rejection of closed form, and the suggestion of the interpenetration of form and the environment through the device of intersecting planes. In Dynamism of a Speeding Horse + Houses (Dinamismo di un cavallo in corso + case, 191415), Boccioni assembled wood, cardboard, and metal, with painted areas showing a Futurist handling of planes influenced by the Cubism of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Ironically, his intention of preserving \"unique forms\" caught in space and time is mocked by the perishability of his materialsthe work has been considerably restored and continues to present conservation problems.Boccioni, like Raymond Duchamp-Villon, made studies of horses from nature before developing the motif into a nonspecific symbol of the modern age. This fully evolved symbol appears in Boccioni's painting The City Rises (La citta che sale, 1910). In Dynamism of a Speeding Horse + Houses he used the horse to demonstrate his observation that the nature of vision produces the illusion of a fusing of forms. When the distance between a galloping horse and a stationary house is visually imperceptible, horse and house appear to merge into a single changing form. Sculptures such as the present example are concerned with the apparent compression of space as an object traverses it, and with the nature of the object's redefinition by that space.In 1913 and 1914 Boccioni made many drawings and watercolors related to the present work that explore the relationship between a galloping horse and a group of houses in close proximity.

The Dresden-based group, part of the larger German Expressionist movement, developed an aesthetic style defined by agitated, coarse lines and intense, blunt colors. Their intention was to wage battle against the constricting forces of bourgeois culture, which they associated with mediocrity, corruption, and weakness. Kirchners emphasis on self-empowerment and absolute freedom from convention was manifested in his early art by the predominance of erotic subject matter. The female nudecrudely rendered as primitive and submissiveserved him and his colleagues as a sign of male domination and virility.Artillerymen, painted two years after Die Bruckes dissolution, marked a change in subject matter. The picture depicts an assembly of naked male soldiers, overseen by a clothed military official. Their attenuated bodies are compressed into an airless, low-ceilinged chamber. Created after Kirchner had been drafted into the German army in 1914 and subsequently released on the grounds of mental instability, this image suggests the artists sense of overwhelming vulnerability. The naked, showering soldiers are powerless as individuals; their wills have been subjected to the rigidity and anonymity of military life. The view that Artillerymen represents Kirchners horror of the war (and fear for his own life) is corroborated in a more overtly autobiographical painting from the same period, Self-Portrait as Soldier. In this oft-reproduced work, a gaunt uniformed Kirchner presents his own severed arm to the viewer, an allusion to the terror of artistic impotence and, ultimately, of death. The presence of a nude female model behind him extends the metaphor to include the possibility of castration, the fear of which would be particularly powerful given Kirchners conflation of sexual prowess, cultural liberation, and aesthetic achievement.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the Vienna of 1914, a woman having an abortion was cause for scandal, even within the confines of the relatively open-minded art world. When such a woman was the widow of a famous composer, unwed, and carrying on two love affairs simultaneously, her decision would alarm even the most sympathetic souls. Thus it is that the agonized knight errant of Oskar Kokoschkas painting is to this day read as an expression of the artists pain over the death of an unborn child and the crumbling of his relationship with the fascinating, and quite unrepentant, Alma Mahler.The central figure appears to be a self-portrait of Kokoschka, clad in the armor of a medieval knight. He lies errant, or lost, in a stormy landscape, his two attributesa winged bird-man and a sphinxlike womanin close proximity. The bird-man has been interpreted either as the figure of death or another self-portrait, while the sphinx-woman has been seen as a stand-in for Mahler. A funereal sky bears the letters E S, which probably refer to Christs lament, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani (My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?) As if the self-equivalence with chivalry and the martyred Christ were not enough, the agitated brushwork and disturbing composition convince us of Kokoschkas spiritual discomfort.If we look at Knight Errant within the context of Austrian art and compare it to the measured and ornate works of Hans Makart or even Gustav Klimt, Kokoschkas radicality emerges clearly. In what was still fin-de-siecle Vienna, Knight Errant was a notable exception for the immediacy of its imagery, which seemed to come more from the realm of psychoanalysis than from contemporary artistic trends. Indeed, Alma Mahlers first husband, Gustav, had consulted Sigmund Freud about his marriage, and the famous couple was apparently versed in psychoanalytic principles. But perhaps Kokoschka was equally influenced by his admiration for Baroque allegorical and literary motifs. Whatever their source, his emotion-charged images stem from a turbulently personal interpretation of Expressionism.Cornelia Lauf\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1915 Francis Picabia abandoned his exploration of abstract form and color to adopt a new machinist idiom that he used until about 1923. Unlike Robert Delaunay or Fernand Leger, who saw the machine as an emblem of a new age, he was attracted to machine shapes for their intrinsic visual and functional qualities. He often used mechanomorphic images humorously as substitutes for human beings; for example, in Here, This is Stieglitz, 1915, the photographer Alfred Stieglitz is portrayed as a camera. In Very Rare Picture on the Earth a self-generating, almost symmetrical machine is presented frontally, clearly silhouetted against a flat, impassive background. Like Picabias own Amorous Parade of 1917 or Marcel Duchamps The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even of 191523, the present work might be read as the evocation of a sexual event in mechanical terms. This dispassionate view of sex is consonant with the antisentimental attitudes that were to characterize Dada. The work has also been interpreted as representing an alchemical processor, in part because of the coating of the two upper cylinders with gold and silver leaf respectively.1Not only is Very Rare Picture on the Earth one of Picabias earliest mechanomorphic works, but it has been identified as his first collage.2 Its mounted wooden forms and integral frame draw attention to the work as objectthe picture is not really a picture, making it very rare indeed. Thus, an ironic note is added to the humorous pomposity of the inscription at upper left.Lucy Flint1. Ulf Linde, et al. Francis Picabia, exh. cat.

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe artists of the Russian avant-garde were distinguished from their Western counterparts in many ways, particularly in the extraordinary number of women in their ranks who were responsible for discovering new bases of artistic creation. Liubov Popova was among the most important of these early pioneers. Her development as an artist was encouraged through private lessons and frequent travel, which brought her into contact with a broad range of historical examples, from Italian Renaissance art and Russian medieval icons to Cubism and other Western vanguard styles. In 1912 she went to Paris with fellow painter Nadezhda Udaltsova to study painting at the Academie de la Palette under Andre Dunoyer de Segonzac, Henri Le Fauconnier, and Jean Metzinger. There she mastered the Cubist idiom and was probably exposed to Italian Futurism, the two styles that would dominate her paintings of the next three and a half years.After returning to Moscow in 1913, she quickly emerged as one of the primary exponents of Russian Cubo-Futurism, an amalgam of the faceted planarity of Cubism and the formal energy of Futurist art. Birsk was completed near the end of her involvement with this style. Its crystalline structure is formally reminiscent of the views of houses in lEstaque painted by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso in 1908, but the vibrant palette attests to Popovas sustained interest in Russian folk and decorative art. Birsk, one of the few landscapes from this stage of Popovas career, was begun during a summer visit to the home of her former governess, who lived near the Ural Mountains in the small town of the paintings title.The painting on the reverse of the same canvas, entitled Portrait of a Woman, shows Popova undertaking a subject that consistently occupied her during 1915: a figure situated in a Cubist-inspired composition. Although this work retains some representational elements, Popovas gradual move away from representation is evident in her forceful application of an abstract visual vocabulary. By the end of 1916 Popova was completely devoted to abstraction, joining Kazimir Malevichs Supremus group and creating paintings composed solely of dynamic geometric forms. These experiments in texture, rhythm, density, and colorwhich she called painterly architectonicsbecame the basis of her textile and theater designs of the 1920s. Like many of her Russian colleagues, Popova would ultimately renounce painting as obsolete and concern herself with the applied arts, which became synonymous with building a new society after the October Revolution.Matthew Drutt\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAfter moving from Rome to Paris in 1906, Gino Severini came into close contact with Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso, and the other leading artists of the avant-garde capital, while staying in touch with his compatriots who remained in Italy. In 1910 he signed the Futurist Painting: Technical Manifesto with four other Italian artists, Giacomo Balla, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carra, and Luigi Russolo, who wanted their paintings to express the energy and speed of modern life.In this painting of a train moving through the countryside, Severini split the landscape in order to impart a sense of the momentary fractured images that characterize our perception of a speeding object. The clash of intense contrasting colors suggests the noise and power of the train, which the Futurists admired as an emblem of vitality and potency.Severinis paintingslike Futurist work in generalare informed by the legacy of Cubism, building on the Cubists deconstruction of the motif, their collage technique, and their incorporation of graphic signs. But the Futurists interest in depicting motion, use of bright expressive color, and politically inspired dedication to bridging the gap between art and life departed decisively from Cubist aesthetic practice, which focused on the rarefied world of the studio, investigating formal issues through often-somber portraits and still lifes.Severini painted this canvas in the midst of World War I while living in Igny, outside Paris. Years later he recalled the circumstances: Next to our hovel, trains were passing day and night, full of war materiel, or soldiers, and wounded. During 1915 he created many canvases in which he attempted to evoke war in paint, culminating in his January 1916 First Futurist Exhibition of Plastic Art of the War. This exhibition, held in Paris, included Red Cross Train Passing a Village. Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the mid-1910s, Brancusi began creating sculptures made from salvaged oak beams he had obtained from demolition contractors in Paris. Having been driven away from handicraft techniques during his academic training, Brancusi was inspired to revisit them through this new encounter with an old materialold wood,\" as he referred to it.1 For Brancusi, wood exacted a tendency toward Expressionism, resulting in unique carved objects. While his stone and metal sculptures represent archetypal forms, such as embracing figures and birds in flight, individual works in wood suggest specific characters or spiritual entities.Watchdog (Chien de garde, 1916) is often designated as the base for The Sorceress (La sorciere, 191624), a piece carved from walnut and interpreted as a flying witch common to Romanian folktales. Never clarifying the visual sources for his designs, Brancusi preferred instead to promote an air of mystery surrounding their origins. Although scholars have widely debated the extent to which Brancusi's work was inspired by African sculpture and Romanian folk carvings, it is clear that he was acutely responsive to \"primitivizing\" influences early in his career. Paul Gauguin's technique of direct carving to emulate the raw quality of indigenous Tahitian art inspired Brancusi to experiment with more daring approaches to sculpture than his academic training had previously prescribed.Brancusi's sculptures often rest atop hand-carved bases that contain geometric designs and are at times highly decorated, possessing their own sculptural qualities. The stacked forms of the object and its base simultaneously maintain identities as separate works of art and as entire structures. Here, Watchdog can both stand alone as an independent sculpture and, with the addition of a limestone wedge, act as a counterpart for The Sorceress. 1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nKazimir Malevich proposed the reductive, abstract style of Suprematism as an alternative to earlier art forms, which he considered inappropriate to his own time. He observed that the proportions of forms in art of the past corresponded with those of objects in nature, which are determined by their function. In opposition to this he proposed a self-referential art in which proportion, scale, color, and disposition obey intrinsic, nonutilitarian laws. Malevich considered his non-objective forms to be reproductions of purely affective sensations that bore no relation to external phenomena. He rejected conventions of gravity, clear orientation, horizon line, and perspective systems.Malevichs units are developed from the straight line and its two-dimensional extension, the plane, and are constituted of contrasting areas of unmodeled color, distinguished by various textural effects. The diagonal orientation of geometric forms creates rhythms on the surface of the canvas. The overlapping of elements and their varying scale relationships within a white ground provide a sense of indefinitely extensive space. Though the organization of the pictorial forms does not correspond with that of traditional subjects, there are various internal regulatory principles. In the present work a magnetic attraction and repulsion seem to dictate the slow rotational movement of parts.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nHenri Matisse often painted the same subject in versions that range from relatively realistic to more abstract or schematic. At times the transition from realism to abstraction could be enacted in a single canvas, as is the case with The Italian Woman, the first of many portraits Matisse painted of a professional Italian model named Laurette. The purposefully visible pentimenti and labored convergence of lines bear witness to his perpetual struggle to reach that state of condensation of sensations which constitutes a picture. Matisse was not interested in capturing momentary impressions; he strove to create an enduring conception.From the earlier state of the portrait, which depicts a heavier woman, Matisse pared down Laurettes image, in the process making her less corporeal and more ethereal. Using the conventions of religious paintinga frontal pose, introspective countenance, and flat back-ground devoid of any indication of locationhe created an icon of Woman. The emphatic eyes and brow, elongated nose, and pursed lips of her schematic face resemble an African mask, implying that Matisse, like so many Modern artists, equated the idea of Woman with the foreign, exotic, and primitive; he continued in this vein, posing the same model with a turban and a mantilla.The spatial ambiguity of this portraitthe way the arms appear flat while the background overtakes a shoulder, for examplereveals Matisses relationship to Paul Cezanne via the bolder experiments of Cubism. In a 1913 portrait of his wife, Matisse had played with the distinctions between volume and plane by including a flattened scarf that wraps around her arm. This treatment anticipates the shawl-like background of The Italian Woman. These paintings recall Cezannes series of portraits of Madame Cezanne (one of which was owned by Matisse) both formally and iconographically, although Matisses images are more radically schematized and distilled.The austerity of color and severe reduction of The Italian Woman is characteristic of Matisses work from 1914 to 1918. The art historian Pierre Schneider has suggested that these elements embody the artists response to the devastation of World War I.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWhen Mondrian saw Cubist paintings by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso at a 1911 exhibition in Amsterdam, he was inspired to go to Paris. Tableau No. 2/Composition No. VII, painted a year after his arrival in 1912, exemplifies Mondrians regard for the new technique. With a procedure indebted to high Analytic Cubism, Mondrian broke down his motifin this case a treeinto a scaffolding of interlocking black lines and planes of color; furthermore, his palette of close-valued ocher and gray tones resembles Cubist canvases. Yet Mondrian went beyond the Parisian Cubists degree of abstraction: his subjects are less recognizable, in part because he eschewed any suggestion of volume, and, unlike the Cubists, who rooted their compositions at the bottom of the canvas in order to depict a figure subject to gravity, Mondrians scaffolding fades at the paintings edges. In works such as Composition 8, based on studies of Parisian building facades, Mondrian went even further in his refusal of illusionism and the representation of volume.During the war years, Mondrian continued to move toward greater abstraction, rejecting diagonal lines and decreasing his reliance on his favored subjectstrees, seascapes, and architecture. Composition, which developed from studies of a church, is among the last of his works that can be traced to an observable source. Canvases like this make it clear that Mondrians interest lay foremost in coming to terms with the two-dimensionality of the painted surface. For this work, the artist designed a strip frame (now lost), which he said prevented the sensation of depth created by traditional carved frames.The inexorable consistency and internal logic of his solutions hint at a larger conceptual principle, which is outlined in great depth in the artists extensive theoretical writings. Like many pioneers of abstraction, Mondrians impetus was largely spiritual. He aimed to distill the real world to its pure essence, to represent the dichotomies of the universe in eternal tension. To achieve this, he privileged certain principlesstability, universality, and spiritualitythrough the yin/yang balancing of horizontal and vertical strokes. His philosophical framework was grounded in the Neoplatonic and Tantric-inspired texts of authors connected to the Theosophical Society, the Dutch branch of which had counted Mondrian as a member since 1909.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe artists of the Russian avant-garde were distinguished from their Western counterparts in many ways, particularly in the extraordinary number of women in their ranks who were responsible for discovering new bases of artistic creation. Liubov Popova was among the most important of these early pioneers. Her development as an artist was encouraged through private lessons and frequent travel, which brought her into contact with a broad range of historical examples, from Italian Renaissance art and Russian medieval icons to Cubism and other Western vanguard styles. In 1912 she went to Paris with fellow painter Nadezhda Udaltsova to study painting at the Academie de la Palette under Andre Dunoyer de Segonzac, Henri Le Fauconnier, and Jean Metzinger. There she mastered the Cubist idiom and was probably exposed to Italian Futurism, the two styles that would dominate her paintings of the next three and a half years.After returning to Moscow in 1913, she quickly emerged as one of the primary exponents of Russian Cubo-Futurism, an amalgam of the faceted planarity of Cubism and the formal energy of Futurist art. Birsk was completed near the end of her involvement with this style. Its crystalline structure is formally reminiscent of the views of houses in lEstaque painted by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso in 1908, but the vibrant palette attests to Popovas sustained interest in Russian folk and decorative art. Birsk, one of the few landscapes from this stage of Popovas career, was begun during a summer visit to the home of her former governess, who lived near the Ural Mountains in the small town of the paintings title.The painting on the reverse of the same canvas, entitled Portrait of a Woman, shows Popova undertaking a subject that consistently occupied her during 1915: a figure situated in a Cubist-inspired composition. Although this work retains some representational elements, Popovas gradual move away from representation is evident in her forceful application of an abstract visual vocabulary. By the end of 1916 Popova was completely devoted to abstraction, joining Kazimir Malevichs Supremus group and creating paintings composed solely of dynamic geometric forms. These experiments in texture, rhythm, density, and colorwhich she called painterly architectonicsbecame the basis of her textile and theater designs of the 1920s. Like many of her Russian colleagues, Popova would ultimately renounce painting as obsolete and concern herself with the applied arts, which became synonymous with building a new society after the October Revolution.Matthew Drutt\r\n        ",

This drawing is preparatory to his most successful painting in this style, The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself with Her Shadows of 1916 (Collection The Museum of Modern Art, New York), the subject of which was inspired by a vaudeville dancer whose movement he wished to suggest in a series of varying poses.1 Man Rays interest in frozen sequential movement may derive from the experiments in photography he initiated about this time.The particularized features of the figures in this drawing are eliminated to produce two-dimensional patterned forms that are silhouetted against black oval shadows. The dancer is accompanied not only by her shadow but also by music, concisely indicated by the voluted head of an instrument at the lower right of the support, the strings across the bottom, and the music stand at left. The position of her feet on the strings, which may double as a stave, may be meant to convey a specific sequence of notes, as if the dancer were indeed accompanying herself musically. It seems likely that this drawing represents the first stage in the conception of the painting. In the canvas the three positions of the dancer are superimposed and appear at the top of the composition, with the greater part of the field occupied by her distorted, enlarged, and vividly colored cutout shadows.Lucy Flint1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe subject of Egon Schieles portrait is Johann Harms, his father-in-law. The painting demonstrates Schieles sympathy for the 73-year-old man, a retired machinist with the Austrian railway. Although a family portrait, it conveys a somber monumentality. With a stateliness that transcends its subject, the painting is reminiscent of papal portraits by Raphael or Titian. The work is known as the first in a series of painterly portraits, as opposed to earlier canvases that Schiele executed in a more graphic style.Schiele designed the chair in the painting for his studio and used it several times for portraits. As a prop, it allowed the artist to push his subjects toward the picture plane, flattening and enlarging the contours of their bodies. The chair also recalls the furniture in Vincent van Goghs paintings of his own bedroom; its handcrafted style reminds us of the importance of the decorative arts in Vienna at this time.Schiele painted the portrait two years before his death from influenza. It is an example of his mature style and goes far in abolishing fixed notions of Austrian Expressionism as only an art of angst. It also demonstrates that Schiele could successfully depart from his well-known fascination with the physical and psychic dimensions of sexuality. In 1916, after initial difficulties in his marriage to Edith Harms, Schiele was beginning to enjoy a sense of domestic happiness that would lead to other intimate family portraits. Schieles fondness for Johann Harms carried beyond this portraitafter the old mans death in 1917, Schiele made a death mask of his father-in-law.Cornelia Lauf\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlbert Gleizes, a self-trained Cubist painter renowned for his pioneering writings on Cubism, worked in his fathers industrial-design workshop, but soon began to paint in a late Impressionist style. After four years in the French army, Gleizes became a life-long opponent of militarism and created an association of artists that contested its influence through theater and poetry. In 1906 he cofounded the short-lived utopian community Abbaye de Creteil with other like-minded painters, musicians, and writers.As Gleizess compositions grew more linear, he found inspiration in the subject matter and simplified forms of such painters as Henri Le Fauconnier, whom he met at the 1909 Salon dAutomne. In 1910 he participated in the Salon des Independants and established important ties with Robert Delaunay, Fernand Leger, and Jean Metzinger. Upon seeing Pablo Picassos and Georges Braques Cubist work in 1911, he wrote articles that led to the 1912 publication of Du Cubisme (On Cubism), a major treatise cowritten with Metzinger. Eventually, he advocated for two distinct schools, that of Picasso and Braque and that of the Salon Cubists, which included himself, Leger, and Metzinger.With the outbreak of World War I, Gleizes reenlisted in the army. The experience led to the development of his spiritual identity and a strong belief in pacifism. A major work from this period is Portrait of an Army Doctor (Portrait dun medecin militaire, 191415), commissioned by the doctor at his garrison. A forceful composition of geometric and semicircular interlocking planes, only the white triangles of the surgeons gown suggest the subjects identity. Also during 1915 and 1917, Gleizes made two seminal visits to New York, where he was indelibly impressed by the citys skyline and energy. The architecture of the Brooklyn Bridge inspired a series of images celebrating this feat of modernity. In On Brooklyn Bridge (Sur Brooklyn Bridge, 1917), concentric forms and stark diagonals dynamically interlock, suggesting the bridges complex engineering. It was also during this time that Gleizes had his first solo exhibition in Europe.By 1927, Gleizes had moved to the country and established the art colony Moly-Sabata, espousing a return to agriculture and manual crafts. He remained involved with the Parisian art world, however, and in 1930 was associated with the group Cercle et Carre (Circle and Square, which was later absorbed by Abstraction-Creation [Abstraction-Creation], an international forum for abstract painting). In 1934 he abandoned strict nonrepresentational painting for figurative murals. With the outbreak of World War II, he joined the Roman Catholic Church and turned to religious subjects.Karole Vail\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nBeginning in 1902, Juan Gris contributed drawings to illustrated journals, first in his birthplace Madrid and then in Paris, where he settled in 1906. Working in an Art Nouveau style, he supported himself with his humorous and satirical drawings and caricatures. Gris resided at Le Bateau Lavoir at 13, rue Ravignan, where Pablo Picasso also lived. Witness to the birth of Cubism, Gris embraced the revolutionary approach and participated in its early evolution. In Houses in Paris (Maisons a Paris), one of at least six canvases of his Montmartre neighborhood painted in 1911, the artist experimented with tropes he learned from Picasso and Georges Braque while retaining his own sensibility and color palette. Creating severely flattened architectural spaces and rendering passages of shadow and light on their own plane, Gris applied a modern technique to the urban landscapeas Robert Delaunay and Fernand Leger were doing in their canvaseswhile drawing on his work as an illustrator for the juxtaposition of shapes, strong tonal contrasts, and overall visual rhythm of the surface.The outbreak of World War I dispersed many in Griss milieu, the artists and writers central to Cubisms development in Paris. Guillaume Apollinaire, Braque, Andre Derain, Albert Gleizes, Leger, and Louis Marcoussis, among many others entered military service from which Gris was exempt due to his Spanish citizenship. Renowned dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler who represented Gris since 1912 was forced to leave Paris for Bern, Switzerland. In November 1917 Leonce Rosenberg took up the sales of Griss work, and during the same month Gris painted Fruit Dish on a Checkered Tablecloth (Compotier et nappe a carreaux). Like other still lifes from this period, this work is particularly rich in texture and color, featuring overlapping patterns and compositional elements that reflect the artists practice in collage.Despite Cubisms break with traditional painting, such as eliminating the representation of depth in this canvas, Gris valued the conventions of painting still lifes and shunned the explorations into total abstraction that was of interest to some Cubists such as Jean Metzinger and Amedee Ozenfant. Gris admitted to studying the subjects and methods of the old mastersOzenfant called him a specialist in museumsin his effort to reconcile modern expression and historical traditions. Rooted by the still-life legacy essential to Spanish painting, Gris maintained a reverence for the object and the poetic metaphors that could be suggested by the evocative combination of these objects.Tracey Bashkoff\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nDuring the summer of 1923 Joan Miro began painting The Tilled Field, a view of his familys farm in Montroig, Catalonia. Although thematically related to his earlier quasi-realistic, Fauvist-colored rural views, such as Prades, The Village, this painting is the first example of Miros Surrealist vision. Its fanciful juxtaposition of human, animal, and vegetal forms and its array of schematized creatures constitute a realm visible only to the minds eye, and reveal the great range of Miros imagination. While working on the painting he wrote, I have managed to escape into the absolute of nature. The Tilled Field is thus a poetic metaphor that expresses Miro's idyllic conception of his homeland, where, he said, he could not conceive of the wrongdoings of mankind.The complex iconography of The Tilled Field has myriad sources, and attests to Miros long-standing interest in his artistic heritage. The muted, contrasting tones of the painting recall the colors of Catalan Romanesque frescoes, while the overt flatness of the paintingspace is suggested by three horizontal bands indicating sky, sea, and earthand the decorative scattering of multicolored animals throughout were most likely inspired by medieval Spanish tapestries. These lively creatures are themselves derived from Catalan ceramics, which Miro collected and kept in his studio. The stylized figure with a plow has its source in the prehistoric cave paintings of Altamira, which Miro knew well. Even the enormous eye peering through the foliage of the pine tree, and the eye-covered pine cone beneath it, can be traced to examples of early Christian art, in which the wings of angels were bedecked with many tiny eyes. Miro found something alive and magical in all things: the gigantic ear affixed to the trunk of the tree, for example, reflects his belief that every object contains a living soul.Miros spirited depiction of The Tilled Field also has political content. The three flagsFrench, Catalan, and Spanishrefer to Catalonias attempts to secede from the central Spanish government. Primo de Rivera, who assumed Spains dictatorship in 1923, instituted strict measures, such as banning the Catalan language and flag, to repress Catalan separatism. By depicting the Catalan and French flags together, across the border post from the Spanish flag, Miro announced his allegiance to the Catalan cause.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

Inspired by Paul Gauguins directly carved sculptures, which were exhibited in a retrospective that year, Constantin Brancusi, Andre Derain, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso began to make archaizing stone and wood sculptures. Brancusi, with whom Modigliani developed a close friendship, exerted a strong influence on the Italian; this is particularly obvious in his attempts at carving between the years 1909 and 1915, when he made idol-like heads and caryatids with monumental and simplified forms.Modiglianis sculptural concerns were translated into paint in Jeanne Hebuterne with Yellow Sweater, in which he portrayed his young companion as a kind of fertility goddess. With her highly stylized narrow face and blank eyes she has the serene countenance of a deity, and the artists emphasis on massive hips and thighs mimics the focus of ancient sculptures that fetishize reproduction. Both this work and Nude, with their simplified, elongated oval faces, gracefully attenuated noses, and button mouths, suggest the artists interest in African masks.Modigliani painted the human figure almost exclusively and created at least 26 reclining female nudes. Although the impact of Modernist practice on his art was great, he was also profoundly concerned with tradition; the poses of Nude and similar works echo precursors by Titian, Goya, and Velazquez. Nevertheless, Modiglianis figures differ significantly in the level of raw sensuality they transmit. His nudes have often been considered lascivious, even pornographic, in part because they are depicted with body hair, but perhaps also due to the artists reputation for debauchery. His nickname, Modi, rhymes with the French word maudit (accursed), a name he very likely acquired because of his lifestyle. Modigliani died of tuberculosis and complications probably brought on by substance abuse and hard living. The tragic fact that Jeanne Hebuterne, pregnant with their second child, committed suicide the next day has only contributed to the infusion of romantic speculation concerning Modiglianis work.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

Working closely together, the group stressed the need for abstraction and simplification. Subject matter was excluded from their works; composition was constructed on the principle of the straight line, rectangle, or cube; and the palette was reduced to the primary colors, black, gray, and white. They extended these principles to all the artsarchitecture, graphic and industrial design, painting, and sculpture. \nComposition XI, which van Doesburg painted in early 1918, features a series of rectangular planes floating on the surface of the canvas.

    "description": "\nDescription\nMax Ernst came to artistic maturity during one of the most fractious periods in European history. Both politically and culturally, the second decade of the 20th century was a tumultuous period which brought major change to Europe: World War I broke out, the Russian empire collapsed, and avant-garde organizations proliferated in the arts. In Germany, where Ernst was born to an amateur painter and his wife in 1891, the journal Der Sturm began publication in 1910 and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) group was formed in Munich in 1911. These and many other manifestations of the avant-garde provided the impetus for Ernst's rejection of the academic tradition represented by his father's paintings.\nErnst was conscripted into the military as an artillery engineer during World War I and was twice wounded, yet managed to pursue his artistic interests throughout the course of the war, exhibiting in Berlin at the Der Sturm gallery in 1916. The following year, he published \"Vom Werden der Farbe\" (\"On the Origins of Colour\"), an article that paid tribute to Marc Chagall, Robert Delaunay, and Vasily Kandinsky, reflecting Ernst's aesthetic interests at the time. Landscape (Stadt mit Tieren, ca. 191416) similarly represents a synthesis of artistic idioms gleaned from his peers: the pictorial logic invokes a Cubist idiom, while the palette and animal forms recall the paintings of Heinrich Campendonk and Franz Marc.\nWhile Landscape predates Ernst's involvement with Cologne Dada in the late 1910s and the Surrealist movement in the 1920s, the startling juxtapositions and fantastic imagery foreshadow this later work. Active among the Surrealists, who plumbed the recesses of the mind and the world of dreams for their imagery, Ernst would develop his own highly personal iconography, including the man with the bowler hat and the bird seen in this painting. The former has been interpreted as a reference to his father, while the latter evolved into the artist's alter ego \"Loplop\" and appeared frequently throughout Ernst's oeuvre. The prominent eyespresaging the Surrealist fascination with visioncompound the ambiguity of the canvas: they appear frontally in the profiles of the animals in the foreground and are partially obscured in the landscape below the figure with the bowler hat. Resistant to ready interpretation, this painting is perhaps best understood in terms of Louis Aragon's comment that \"Max Ernst's thought must be grasped at that point where, with a bit of color, some sketching, he tries to acclimate the specter he has just hurled into an alien landscape, or at that point where he places in the new arrival's hand an object the other cannot touch.\"1\nJ.

Nevertheless, it is virtually impossible to confuse a work by Klee with one by any other artist, even though many have emulated his idiosyncratic, enigmatic art. So accepted was his work that Klee was embraced over the years by the Blue Rider group, the European Dada contingent, the Surrealists, and the Bauhaus faculty, with whom he taught for a decade in Weimar and Dessau.As part of the early 20th-century avant-garde, Klee formulated a personal abstract pictorial language. His vocabulary, which oscillates freely between the figurative and the nonrepresentational, communicates through a unique symbology that is more expressive than descriptive. Klee conveyed his meanings through an often whimsical fusion of form and text, frequently writing the titles to his works on the mats upon which they are mounted and including words within the images themselves. Such is the case with The Bavarian Don Giovanni, in which Klee indicated his admiration for the Mozart opera as well as for certain contemporary sopranos, while hinting at his own amorous pursuits. A veiled self-portrait, the figure climbing the ladder is surrounded by five womens names, an allusion to the operatic scene in which Don Giovannis servant Leporello recites a list of his masters 2,065 love affairs. Citing Klees confession that his infatuations changed with every soubrette at the opera, art historian K. Porter Aichele has identified the Emma and Theres of the watercolor as the singers Emma Carelli and Therese Rothauser. The othersCenzl, Kathi, and Marirefer to models with whom Klee had fleeting romantic interludes.Although much of Klees work is figurative, compositional design nearly always preceded narrative association. The artist often transformed his experiments in tonal value and line into visual anecdotes. Red Balloon, for example, is at once a cluster of delicately colored, floating geometric shapes and a charming cityscape. Runner at the Goal is an essay in simultaneity; overlapping and partially translucent bars of color illustrate the consecutive gestures of a figure in motion. The flailing arms and sprinting legs add a comic touch to this figure, on whose forehead the number one promises a winning finish.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

Responsive to the technological advances and assertive advertising that followed World War I, he embarked on his mechanical period with works such as Men in the City and the related The City of 191929 (Collection Philadelphia Museum of Art).In the urban themes of this period the human figure becomes as de-individualized and mechanized as the environment it occupies. Leger is able to express the rhythmic energy of contemporary life by finding its pictorial equivalent. Form, color, and shape are considered primarily for their plastic values and are given equal emphasis. They confront one another in a multitude of relations, creating single images that capture simultaneous sensations. Confusion of parts does not result, because Leger distributes planes evenly and builds his compositions with blocky areas of flat, easily read, unmixed color and clear and incisive outline. He conveys a sense of depth through overlapping planes and changes in scale rather than with modeling. Legers simple, varied, and clear pictorial elements, like ideal machines, efficiently produce effects of maximum power.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

A self-styled congenial anarchist, Picabia, along with his colleague Marcel Duchamp, brought Dada to the New York art world in 1915, the same year he began making his enigmatic machinist portraits, such as The Child Carburetor, which had an immediate and lasting effect on American art. The Child Carburetor is based on an engineers diagram of a Racing Claudel carburetor, but the descriptive labels that identify its various mechanical elements establish a correspondence between machines and human bodies; the composition suggests two sets of male and female genitals. Considered within the context created by Duchamps contemporaneous work The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (191523), as art historian William Camfield has observed, The Child Carburetor, with its bride that is a kind of motor operated by love gasoline, also becomes a love machine. Its forms and inscriptions abound in sexual analogies, but because the mechanical elements are nonoperative or impotent, the sexual act is not consummated. Whether the implication can be drawn that procreation is an incidental consequence of sexual pleasure, or simply that this child machine has not yet sufficiently matured to its full potential, remains unclear. Picabia stressed the psychological possibilities of machines as metaphors for human sexuality, but he refused to explicate them. Beneath the humor of his witty pictograms and comic references to copulating anthropomorphic machines lies the suggestion of a critiquealways formulated in a punning fashiondirected against the infallibility of science and the certainty of technological progress. The Child Carburetor and Picabias other quirky, though beautifully painted, little machines (which he continued to make until 1922) are indeed fallible. If they are amusingly naive as science fictions or erotic machines, they are also entirely earnest in placing man at the center of Picabias universe, albeit a mechanical one.Jan Avgikos\r\n        ",

The artists collages, of which he produced more than 2,000, and his large-scale reliefs known as Merzbilder are kaleidoscopic, sometimes whimsical accretions of humble found materialtram tickets, ration coupons, postage stamps, beer labels, candy wrappers, newspaper clippings, fabric swatches, rusty nails, and the likethat bespeak the flux of contemporary society. In his early collages, such as Merz 163, with Woman Sweating and Merz 199, Schwitters subjected his bits of flotsam to an organizing principle resembling the vertical scaffolding of Analytic Cubism, thus transforming the diverse components into formal elements. Embedded in each collage, however, are hints of narrative.Merzbild 5B (Picture-Red-Heart-Church) contains many such abbreviated clues, which suggest that Schwitters was not the neutral, disengaged artist described by some historians. The graphic motifsa red heart, a simple church, and the number 69can all be found in Schwitterss Dadaesque line drawings dating from the same year, which contain elements that are possibly autobiographical. Their reappearance in this collaged construction suggests the artists dedication to his subject matter. The work also harbors specifically political intimations: it includes the partially concealed front page of the German newspaper Hannoverischer Kurier dated February 4, 1919 and describing the overthrow of the short-lived socialist republic of Bremen in a bloody insurrection led by conservative forces. Although Schwitters was not directly involved in this conflict, his acquaintance Ludwig Baumer, of whom he created a Merz portrait in 1920, was a leading advocate of proletarian liberation. Baumers politicized, utopian aspirations were analogous, in a sense, to Schwitterss optimistic embrace of Merz as an aesthetic metaphor for free will. The artist even applied his strategy of accumulation to his own home, creating the fantastic, multicomponent, fully sculptural Merzbau in the interior of his house.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

The following year they continued elaborating their theoretical program, which promulgated a new plastic order of reductivist, non-objective art. In his painting van Doesburg followed Mondrians example by systematically divesting his imagery of figurative references and reducing pictorial elements to colors and geometric forms in oppositional relationships. In so doing, he hoped to express a universal reality underlying the capriciously changeable appearances of nature.This work of 1919 demonstrates van Doesburgs lingering attachment to what he disdainfully referred to as the brown world of Cubism. Reluctant to diffuse the composition, he structures monochromatic, modulated planes around a central axis and allows the lower corners to recede, thereby suggesting a Cubist oval. According to the dogma of the white world of Neo-Plasticism, the focus should be moved from the center of the canvas to its periphery; the rectangle should not be construed as a discrete plane but as a shape passively resulting from the intersection of lines and given substance by color. However, Composition in Gray (Rag-time) incorporates aspects of the Neo-Plastic aesthetic that distinguish its style from Analytic Cubism. For example, the edges of its planes have been regularized and contoured and do not penetrate or overlap one another. Despite the illusion of bowing in individual planes, they have been organized with architectural clarity as a rhythmic composition that is essentially flat and frontal.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

It belongs to a series of about fifty works dating from 191920, based on diagrams of scientific instruments, in which Max Ernst used printers plates to reproduce preexisting images. The impressions, once altered by traditional coloristic and modeling effects, occupy a position between found object and artistic product, like his collages.In both subject and style the series can be compared with Francis Picabias mechanomorphic drawings and paintings. Ernst shared with Picabia an interest in typography, printed images, and language; many of the forms in the present work can be read as letters. They function as well to describe a mechanical structure that can be seen as a symbol of sexual activity, like Picabias Very Rare Picture on the Earth and his The Child Carburetor, 1919 (Collection Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York), or Marcel Duchamps The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, 191523. Ernsts machine is a fantasized solution to the psychological pressures of sexual performance, as announced in the humorously heroic inscription at the bottom of the sheet: Little machine constructed by minimax dadamax in person for fearless pollination of female suckers at the beginning of the change of life and for other such fearless functions. The right side of the machine seems to comprise a miniature laboratory for the production of semen, which is indicated as a red drop that courses through passageways to the left side of the apparatus. The drop finally issues from the yellow faucet, accompanied by a whimsically self-assured and cheerful Bonjour. Alternatively, the machine can be seen as a combination of male and female halves.

An individualist, he rejected association with any artistic school or trend, but his paintings aggressive palette and dependence on color as a means of faceting form and conveying meaning show undeniable affinities with Fauvism and the work of Henri Matisse, as well as with Orphism, Robert Delaunays color-based brand of Cubism. A devoted mystic, Kupka spent his life in search of a transcendental other reality, or fourth dimension. One of the first non-objective artists, he extended his clairvoyant practice to his art as well, by uniting a metaphysical investigation of the human body and nature with daring color and abstract form.Theosophya synthesis of philosophy, religion, and scienceguided Kupkas holistic approach to art. His paintings draw on a variety of sources, including ancient myths, color theory, and contemporary scientific developments. The invention of radiography at the turn of the century was especially significant for Kupka, whose search for an alternative dimension through a kind of painterly X-ray vision is captured in his monumental Planes by Colors, Large Nude. In this work, Kupka rendered the figure of his wife, Eugenie, in vivid shades of purple, green, yellow, and blue, devising an innovative modeling technique based on color, not line or shade, that sections her body into tonal planes in such a way that her inner form is made visible. This unveiling of the unseen is crucial, for Kupka believed that it is only through the senses, through physical experience, that we can reach an extrasensory, metaphysical dimension and thereafter achieve an intuitive understanding of the universal scheme underlying existence.Kupka painted The Colored One ten years after Planes by Colors, Large Nude. By then he had adopted a more boldly abstract mode of figural representation. (He would never abandon subject matter altogether, however, unlike pure abstractionists such as Piet Mondrian.) The Colored One also depicts a female nude, this one lying on her back with legs stretched upward, cradling a radiant yellow sun. Swirling forms outlined in concentrated colors convey the dominant theme in Kupkas work: the organic connections that intertwine human beings with the rest of nature and the cosmos.Bridget Alsdorf\r\n        ",

In the 1920s, while living in Germany, he became an important influence on both the Dutch De Stijl group and the artists of the German Bauhaus.Like Malevich, Lissitzky believed in a new art that rejected traditional pictorial structure, centralized compositional organization, mimesis, and perspectival consistency. In this work the ladder of vividly colored forms seems to be floating through indeterminate space. Spatial relationships are complicated by the veil of white color that divides these forms from the major gray diagonal. The linkage of elements is not attributable to a mysterious magnetic pull, as in Malevichs untitled painting of ca. 1916, but is indicated in a literal way by the device of a connecting threadlike line.

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe monumental oak King of Kings (Le roi des rois, 1938) was originally intended to stand in Brancusi's Temple of Meditation, a private sanctuary commissioned in 1933 by the Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar of Indore. Although never realized, the templeconceived as a windowless chamber (save for a ceiling aperture) with interior reflecting pool, frescoes of birds, and an underground entrancewould have embodied the concerns most essential to Brancusi's art: the idealization of aesthetic form; the integration of architecture, sculpture, and furniture; and the poetic evocation of spiritual thought.Wood elicited from Brancusi a tendency toward Expressionism, resulting in unique carved objects. While his sculptures executed in stone or metal represent archetypal forms, such as birds in flight and sleeping figures, individual works in wood suggest specific characters or spiritual entities. For example, King of Kings may be interpreted as Brancusi's attempt to translate the power of Eastern religion into sculptural form. The work's original title was Spirit of Buddha (L'esprit du Bouddha), and Brancusi is known to have been familiar with Buddhism through the writings of the Tibetan philosopher Milarepa.Although the extent to which Brancusi's work was inspired by African sculpture and Romanian folk carvings has been widely debated among scholars, it is clear that he was acutely responsive to \"primitivizing\" influences early in his career. Paul Gauguin's technique of direct carving to emulate the raw quality of indigenous Tahitian art inspired Brancusi to experiment with more daring approaches to sculpture than his academic training had previously allowed. Gauguin's aesthetic most likely prompted Brancusi to study tribal art, evident in the serrated patterns typical of African carvings on the bottom portion of Adam and Eve (Adam et Eve, 1921) as well as on the sides of King of Kings. The overt sexual references in the former work may also have been inspired by so-called primitive fetishes.Sculptural sources from Brancusi's native country are also abundant: prototypes for the sequential designs of King of Kings have been found in Romanian vernacular architecture such as wooden gate posts and chiseled ornamental pillars. The Sorceress (La sorciere, 191624), pictured with Watchdog (Chien de garde, 1916), has been interpreted as the flying witch described in Romanian peasant tales. Brancusi never clarified the visual sources for his designs, preferring instead to promote an air of mystery surrounding the origins of his vision.Nancy Spector\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nNaum Gabo became a leading exponent of Constructivismwhich viewed space as a continuum rather than a monolithic volumeafter returning to Russia following the Revolution of 1917. Born Naum Neemia Pevsner and younger brother of artist Antoine Pevsner, he had originally trained to be an engineer. While traveling in Europe, he studied building techniques and observed emerging modernist currents, both inspiring him to become a sculptor. In 1920, five years after he created and signed his first construction as Gabo, he and Pevsner published in Moscow the  \"Realisticheskii manifest\" (\"Realistic Manifesto\"), which articulated their theories on Constructivism and solidified Gabos role as a pioneer of modern sculpture.\nGabo considered Column (ca. 1923), of which several versions exist, to be significant to his artistic development. For him, the work represented the height of his search for an image which would fuse the sculptural element with the architectural element into one unit. Originally intended as a maquette for a monument that was never built, it was made after Gabo had immigrated to Germany. Rather than carving it out of a single block, he built Column up into space by means of a rational geometric vocabulary. The result is a virtually symmetrical sculpture composed of transparent and intersecting vertical planes, exposing the works axial center.\nLinear Construction in Space No. 1 (ca. 194546) further emphasizes Gabos predilection for modern building supplies, as opposed to traditional ones like marble, clay, or bronze. The rigid Perspex frame with stretched nylon filaments, a design that characterizes Gabos later spherical works, again creates the illusion of continuous depth. This work too exists in several reconstructions executed after the initial template, like the version now at the Guggenheim Museum. Gabos duplication of forms and insistence on everyday materials is akin to the methodical processes of industrial production.\nUltimately, utopian ideals underscore Gabos Constructivist works. Rejecting the past and freeing art from the imitation of nature, he believed that his sculptures helped build more perfected social and spiritual life. His plastic sculptures are not just literally transparent in surface quality. In dematerializing mass and surface, he also meant to provide a conduit to a new realitya universal reality. Strongly influenced by fellow artist Vasily Kandinsky, who promoted the spiritual nature of art making, Gabo aimed to produce objects that appeal more to our minds and our feelings than to our crude physical senses.\nMegan Fontanella\n",

He observed that the proportions of forms in art of the past corresponded with those of objects in nature, which are determined by their function. In opposition to this he proposed a self-referential art in which proportion, scale, color, and disposition obey intrinsic, nonutilitarian laws. Malevich considered his non-objective forms to be reproductions of purely affective sensations that bore no relation to external phenomena. He rejected conventions of gravity, clear orientation, horizon line, and perspective systems.Malevichs units are developed from the straight line and its two-dimensional extension, the plane, and are constituted of contrasting areas of unmodeled color, distinguished by various textural effects. The diagonal orientation of geometric forms creates rhythms on the surface of the canvas. The overlapping of elements and their varying scale relationships within a white ground provide a sense of indefinitely extensive space. Though the organization of the pictorial forms does not correspond with that of traditional subjects, there are various internal regulatory principles. In the present work a magnetic attraction and repulsion seem to dictate the slow rotational movement of parts.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWhen Amedeo Modigliani moved from Italy to Paris in 1906, the leading artists of the avant-garde were exploring the forms and construction of primitive objects. Inspired by Paul Gauguins directly carved sculptures, which were exhibited in a retrospective that year, Constantin Brancusi, Andre Derain, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso began to make archaizing stone and wood sculptures. Brancusi, with whom Modigliani developed a close friendship, exerted a strong influence on the Italian; this is particularly obvious in his attempts at carving between the years 1909 and 1915, when he made idol-like heads and caryatids with monumental and simplified forms.Modiglianis sculptural concerns were translated into paint in Jeanne Hebuterne with Yellow Sweater, in which he portrayed his young companion as a kind of fertility goddess. With her highly stylized narrow face and blank eyes she has the serene countenance of a deity, and the artists emphasis on massive hips and thighs mimics the focus of ancient sculptures that fetishize reproduction. Both this work and Nude, with their simplified, elongated oval faces, gracefully attenuated noses, and button mouths, suggest the artists interest in African masks.Modigliani painted the human figure almost exclusively and created at least 26 reclining female nudes. Although the impact of Modernist practice on his art was great, he was also profoundly concerned with tradition; the poses of Nude and similar works echo precursors by Titian, Goya, and Velazquez. Nevertheless, Modiglianis figures differ significantly in the level of raw sensuality they transmit. His nudes have often been considered lascivious, even pornographic, in part because they are depicted with body hair, but perhaps also due to the artists reputation for debauchery. His nickname, Modi, rhymes with the French word maudit (accursed), a name he very likely acquired because of his lifestyle. Modigliani died of tuberculosis and complications probably brought on by substance abuse and hard living. The tragic fact that Jeanne Hebuterne, pregnant with their second child, committed suicide the next day has only contributed to the infusion of romantic speculation concerning Modiglianis work.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMax Ernst came to artistic maturity during one of the most fractious periods in European history. Both politically and culturally, the second decade of the 20th century was a tumultuous period which brought major change to Europe: World War I broke out, the Russian empire collapsed, and avant-garde organizations proliferated in the arts. In Germany, where Ernst was born to an amateur painter and his wife in 1891, the journal Der Sturm began publication in 1910 and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) group was formed in Munich in 1911. These and many other manifestations of the avant-garde provided the impetus for Ernst's rejection of the academic tradition represented by his father's paintings.\nErnst was conscripted into the military as an artillery engineer during World War I and was twice wounded, yet managed to pursue his artistic interests throughout the course of the war, exhibiting in Berlin at the Der Sturm gallery in 1916. The following year, he published \"Vom Werden der Farbe\" (\"On the Origins of Colour\"), an article that paid tribute to Marc Chagall, Robert Delaunay, and Vasily Kandinsky, reflecting Ernst's aesthetic interests at the time. Landscape (Stadt mit Tieren, ca. 191416) similarly represents a synthesis of artistic idioms gleaned from his peers: the pictorial logic invokes a Cubist idiom, while the palette and animal forms recall the paintings of Heinrich Campendonk and Franz Marc.\nWhile Landscape predates Ernst's involvement with Cologne Dada in the late 1910s and the Surrealist movement in the 1920s, the startling juxtapositions and fantastic imagery foreshadow this later work. Active among the Surrealists, who plumbed the recesses of the mind and the world of dreams for their imagery, Ernst would develop his own highly personal iconography, including the man with the bowler hat and the bird seen in this painting. The former has been interpreted as a reference to his father, while the latter evolved into the artist's alter ego \"Loplop\" and appeared frequently throughout Ernst's oeuvre. The prominent eyespresaging the Surrealist fascination with visioncompound the ambiguity of the canvas: they appear frontally in the profiles of the animals in the foreground and are partially obscured in the landscape below the figure with the bowler hat. Resistant to ready interpretation, this painting is perhaps best understood in terms of Louis Aragon's comment that \"Max Ernst's thought must be grasped at that point where, with a bit of color, some sketching, he tries to acclimate the specter he has just hurled into an alien landscape, or at that point where he places in the new arrival's hand an object the other cannot touch.\"1\nJ.

    "description": "\nDescription\nLittle Machine . . . was executed in Cologne the year Dada was established there. It belongs to a series of about fifty works dating from 191920, based on diagrams of scientific instruments, in which Max Ernst used printers plates to reproduce preexisting images. The impressions, once altered by traditional coloristic and modeling effects, occupy a position between found object and artistic product, like his collages.In both subject and style the series can be compared with Francis Picabias mechanomorphic drawings and paintings. Ernst shared with Picabia an interest in typography, printed images, and language; many of the forms in the present work can be read as letters. They function as well to describe a mechanical structure that can be seen as a symbol of sexual activity, like Picabias Very Rare Picture on the Earth and his The Child Carburetor, 1919 (Collection Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York), or Marcel Duchamps The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, 191523. Ernsts machine is a fantasized solution to the psychological pressures of sexual performance, as announced in the humorously heroic inscription at the bottom of the sheet: Little machine constructed by minimax dadamax in person for fearless pollination of female suckers at the beginning of the change of life and for other such fearless functions. The right side of the machine seems to comprise a miniature laboratory for the production of semen, which is indicated as a red drop that courses through passageways to the left side of the apparatus. The drop finally issues from the yellow faucet, accompanied by a whimsically self-assured and cheerful Bonjour. Alternatively, the machine can be seen as a combination of male and female halves. The female (at the right) is dowdy and angular; the more brilliantly colored male (at the left) fearlessly points away from her.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlthough he moved to Paris at a young age, Frantisek Kupkas Bohemian origins, mysticism, and eccentric personality kept him at a distance from the avant-garde circles of the artistic capital. An individualist, he rejected association with any artistic school or trend, but his paintings aggressive palette and dependence on color as a means of faceting form and conveying meaning show undeniable affinities with Fauvism and the work of Henri Matisse, as well as with Orphism, Robert Delaunays color-based brand of Cubism. A devoted mystic, Kupka spent his life in search of a transcendental other reality, or fourth dimension. One of the first non-objective artists, he extended his clairvoyant practice to his art as well, by uniting a metaphysical investigation of the human body and nature with daring color and abstract form.Theosophya synthesis of philosophy, religion, and scienceguided Kupkas holistic approach to art. His paintings draw on a variety of sources, including ancient myths, color theory, and contemporary scientific developments. The invention of radiography at the turn of the century was especially significant for Kupka, whose search for an alternative dimension through a kind of painterly X-ray vision is captured in his monumental Planes by Colors, Large Nude. In this work, Kupka rendered the figure of his wife, Eugenie, in vivid shades of purple, green, yellow, and blue, devising an innovative modeling technique based on color, not line or shade, that sections her body into tonal planes in such a way that her inner form is made visible. This unveiling of the unseen is crucial, for Kupka believed that it is only through the senses, through physical experience, that we can reach an extrasensory, metaphysical dimension and thereafter achieve an intuitive understanding of the universal scheme underlying existence.Kupka painted The Colored One ten years after Planes by Colors, Large Nude. By then he had adopted a more boldly abstract mode of figural representation. (He would never abandon subject matter altogether, however, unlike pure abstractionists such as Piet Mondrian.) The Colored One also depicts a female nude, this one lying on her back with legs stretched upward, cradling a radiant yellow sun. Swirling forms outlined in concentrated colors convey the dominant theme in Kupkas work: the organic connections that intertwine human beings with the rest of nature and the cosmos.Bridget Alsdorf\r\n        ",

Trained as an engineer and possessing a more pragmatic temperament than that of his mentor, Lissitzky soon became one of the leading exponents of Constructivism. In the 1920s, while living in Germany, he became an important influence on both the Dutch De Stijl group and the artists of the German Bauhaus.Like Malevich, Lissitzky believed in a new art that rejected traditional pictorial structure, centralized compositional organization, mimesis, and perspectival consistency. In this work the ladder of vividly colored forms seems to be floating through indeterminate space. Spatial relationships are complicated by the veil of white color that divides these forms from the major gray diagonal. The linkage of elements is not attributable to a mysterious magnetic pull, as in Malevichs untitled painting of ca. 1916, but is indicated in a literal way by the device of a connecting threadlike line. The winding line changes color as it passes through the various rectangles that may serve as metaphors for different cosmic planes.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe monumental oak King of Kings (Le roi des rois, 1938) was originally intended to stand in Brancusi's Temple of Meditation, a private sanctuary commissioned in 1933 by the Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar of Indore. Although never realized, the templeconceived as a windowless chamber (save for a ceiling aperture) with interior reflecting pool, frescoes of birds, and an underground entrancewould have embodied the concerns most essential to Brancusi's art: the idealization of aesthetic form; the integration of architecture, sculpture, and furniture; and the poetic evocation of spiritual thought.Wood elicited from Brancusi a tendency toward Expressionism, resulting in unique carved objects. While his sculptures executed in stone or metal represent archetypal forms, such as birds in flight and sleeping figures, individual works in wood suggest specific characters or spiritual entities. For example, King of Kings may be interpreted as Brancusi's attempt to translate the power of Eastern religion into sculptural form. The work's original title was Spirit of Buddha (L'esprit du Bouddha), and Brancusi is known to have been familiar with Buddhism through the writings of the Tibetan philosopher Milarepa.Although the extent to which Brancusi's work was inspired by African sculpture and Romanian folk carvings has been widely debated among scholars, it is clear that he was acutely responsive to \"primitivizing\" influences early in his career. Paul Gauguin's technique of direct carving to emulate the raw quality of indigenous Tahitian art inspired Brancusi to experiment with more daring approaches to sculpture than his academic training had previously allowed. Gauguin's aesthetic most likely prompted Brancusi to study tribal art, evident in the serrated patterns typical of African carvings on the bottom portion of Adam and Eve (Adam et Eve, 1921) as well as on the sides of King of Kings. The overt sexual references in the former work may also have been inspired by so-called primitive fetishes.Sculptural sources from Brancusi's native country are also abundant: prototypes for the sequential designs of King of Kings have been found in Romanian vernacular architecture such as wooden gate posts and chiseled ornamental pillars. The Sorceress (La sorciere, 191624), pictured with Watchdog (Chien de garde, 1916), has been interpreted as the flying witch described in Romanian peasant tales. Brancusi never clarified the visual sources for his designs, preferring instead to promote an air of mystery surrounding the origins of his vision.Nancy Spector\n",

In about 1920 he turned from the production of bas-reliefs and frontalized constructions to the execution of more classically ordered, freestanding sculptures. Head of a Young Girl may have appeared originally as a drawing. However, in this bust Laurens expresses Cubist painting principles in essentially sculptural terms. The tilted surfaces and geometric volumes of the sculpture interpenetrate to constitute a compact whole. Circling the piece, the viewer perceives dramatically different aspects of the head, which provide a variety of visual experiences unexpected in a form so schematically reduced.The structuring planes of one side of the head are broad and unadorned; its edges and planar junctures form strong, uninterrupted curves and straight lines. The other side is articulated with detail; its jagged, hewn contour describing hair contrasts rhythmically with the sweeping curve of the opposite cheek. Laurens slices into the polyhedron that determines the facial planes to describe nose, upper lip, and chin at one stroke. The subtle modeling, particularly of the almond eye and simplified mouth, produces nuanced relations of light and shadow. Despite the geometric clarity of structure, the delicacy of the young girls features and her self-contained pose create a gentle, meditative quality.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

Guggenheim Museum, New York; the whereabouts of the other is presently unknown. The composition is informed by the Purist aesthetic as developed by Amedee Ozenfant and Le Corbusier in 1918. Drawing on pre-1914 Cubism, particularly the coolly rational interpretation of Juan Gris, they dismissed its subsequent evolution as too decorative and unordered. They felt that the chaos of the natural world should be dispelled by the organizing mechanisms of the human mind. This conviction became a moral imperative that Ozenfant and Le Corbusier attempted to uphold in their work.Ozenfant used the following metaphor to describe the function of rational thought: A lens concentrates the diffuse rays of the sun and creates fire by converging those rays. To converge is to refine something in nature, so as to render it more concentrated, compact, penetrative, intense: it helps to facilitate the manifestations of that phenomenon and to render it effective and useful for humanity.1 Ozenfants application of this principle to paintings such as Guitar and Bottles resulted in compositions that are lucid and geometric but somewhat dry.Lucy Flint1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nAfter World War I, a number of artists active in the international avant-garde (including French painters Andre Derain, Fernand Leger, and Henri Matisse, as well as Italians Giorgio de Chirico and Gino Severini) turned to classicism as a source for form and content. This reinterpretation of classical imagery has been described as a search for tranquility in a world destabilized by the carnage of war and the socioeconomic upheaval caused by mass industrialization. The informal name for this period, the Return to Order, comes from French poet Jean Cocteaus book Le rappel a lordre (1926), in which he discussed these developments.\nOne of Pablo Picassos early classicizing works is Olga Picasso in an Armchair (Portrait dOlga dans un fauteuil, 1917), an oil painting of his future wife, a dancer with the Ballets Russes, in a style inspired by the work of 19th-century neoclassicist Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. In Picassos static and calm composition, the figure is elegantly and ideally proportioned. Before long, however, the artist subverted his own placid style with works such as Three Bathers (Trois baigneuses, August 1920), in which he created what might at first seem like an Arcadian idyll, until one notices that the bodies of the languishing nudes are distorted. A gigantic hand and swollen arm cradle the too-small head of the reclining figure in the foreground, while the arms and legs of the seated nude are impossibly long relative to her head and torso. With these enlargements and attenuations, Picasso combined classical symmetry with its opposite, the grotesque. The liberties with form are magnified by the amount of space they takenearly the entire width and height of the pictureand their placement against three bands of almost entirely unmodulated color meant to stand for blanket, water, and sky. The insertion of such inflated forms into a shallow space conveys a monumentality of scale, regardless of the dimensions of the work itself.\nRobin Clark\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe monumental oak King of Kings (Le roi des rois, 1938) was originally intended to stand in Brancusi's Temple of Meditation, a private sanctuary commissioned in 1933 by the Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar of Indore. Although never realized, the templeconceived as a windowless chamber (save for a ceiling aperture) with interior reflecting pool, frescoes of birds, and an underground entrancewould have embodied the concerns most essential to Brancusi's art: the idealization of aesthetic form; the integration of architecture, sculpture, and furniture; and the poetic evocation of spiritual thought.Wood elicited from Brancusi a tendency toward Expressionism, resulting in unique carved objects. While his sculptures executed in stone or metal represent archetypal forms, such as birds in flight and sleeping figures, individual works in wood suggest specific characters or spiritual entities. For example, King of Kings may be interpreted as Brancusi's attempt to translate the power of Eastern religion into sculptural form. The work's original title was Spirit of Buddha (L'esprit du Bouddha), and Brancusi is known to have been familiar with Buddhism through the writings of the Tibetan philosopher Milarepa.Although the extent to which Brancusi's work was inspired by African sculpture and Romanian folk carvings has been widely debated among scholars, it is clear that he was acutely responsive to \"primitivizing\" influences early in his career. Paul Gauguin's technique of direct carving to emulate the raw quality of indigenous Tahitian art inspired Brancusi to experiment with more daring approaches to sculpture than his academic training had previously allowed. Gauguin's aesthetic most likely prompted Brancusi to study tribal art, evident in the serrated patterns typical of African carvings on the bottom portion of Adam and Eve (Adam et Eve, 1921) as well as on the sides of King of Kings. The overt sexual references in the former work may also have been inspired by so-called primitive fetishes.Sculptural sources from Brancusi's native country are also abundant: prototypes for the sequential designs of King of Kings have been found in Romanian vernacular architecture such as wooden gate posts and chiseled ornamental pillars. The Sorceress (La sorciere, 191624), pictured with Watchdog (Chien de garde, 1916), has been interpreted as the flying witch described in Romanian peasant tales. Brancusi never clarified the visual sources for his designs, preferring instead to promote an air of mystery surrounding the origins of his vision.Nancy Spector\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nPaul Klees persistent shifts in style, technique, and subject matter indicate a deliberate and highly playful evasion of aesthetic categorization. Nevertheless, it is virtually impossible to confuse a work by Klee with one by any other artist, even though many have emulated his idiosyncratic, enigmatic art. So accepted was his work that Klee was embraced over the years by the Blue Rider group, the European Dada contingent, the Surrealists, and the Bauhaus faculty, with whom he taught for a decade in Weimar and Dessau.As part of the early 20th-century avant-garde, Klee formulated a personal abstract pictorial language. His vocabulary, which oscillates freely between the figurative and the nonrepresentational, communicates through a unique symbology that is more expressive than descriptive. Klee conveyed his meanings through an often whimsical fusion of form and text, frequently writing the titles to his works on the mats upon which they are mounted and including words within the images themselves. Such is the case with The Bavarian Don Giovanni, in which Klee indicated his admiration for the Mozart opera as well as for certain contemporary sopranos, while hinting at his own amorous pursuits. A veiled self-portrait, the figure climbing the ladder is surrounded by five womens names, an allusion to the operatic scene in which Don Giovannis servant Leporello recites a list of his masters 2,065 love affairs. Citing Klees confession that his infatuations changed with every soubrette at the opera, art historian K. Porter Aichele has identified the Emma and Theres of the watercolor as the singers Emma Carelli and Therese Rothauser. The othersCenzl, Kathi, and Marirefer to models with whom Klee had fleeting romantic interludes.Although much of Klees work is figurative, compositional design nearly always preceded narrative association. The artist often transformed his experiments in tonal value and line into visual anecdotes. Red Balloon, for example, is at once a cluster of delicately colored, floating geometric shapes and a charming cityscape. Runner at the Goal is an essay in simultaneity; overlapping and partially translucent bars of color illustrate the consecutive gestures of a figure in motion. The flailing arms and sprinting legs add a comic touch to this figure, on whose forehead the number one promises a winning finish.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

After more than a decade of working with an array of graphic mediums, he turned his attention to painting. In 1911, together with his brothers Marcel Duchamp and Raymond Duchamp-Villon, he formed the Puteaux Group, a collective of Cubist artists that held meetings in Villons Puteaux studio. \nColor Perspective (Perspective coloree, 1921) is one of a number of similarly titled abstract paintings executed by Jacques Villon in the 1920s. The overlapping blocks of sharply defined forms in this composition recall both his work in the graphic arts and his early Cubist phase. Unlike most other artists of this period, for whom nonobjective art was an absolute form of expression divorced from external references, Villon often derived his abstractions from figurative studies that he worked into successively more abstract compositions. Though the paintings exact source is not known, its synthesized, polychromatic planes bear a strong resemblance to Villons contemporary series of Jockey pictures (1921), which portray a horse and rider in motion. \nIn the 1930s, as a member of the Abstraction-Creation group in Paris, Villons paintings began to combine hard-edged abstraction with curvilinear overdrawing. In his later works, Villon returned to a Cubist idiom in portraits and landscapes, occasionally superimposing figurative line drawings to create densely layered images.\nMatthew Drutt\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nVasily Kandinsky referred to the early 1920s as his cool period. From this time geometric shapes became increasingly prevalent in his work, often floating in front of or within a broad plane, as in White Cross. Here straight lines and circles offset looser, organic forms and irregularly geometric shapes. A corresponding variation of brushstroke produces highly active passages contrasting with less inflected areas. Some shapes may have their distant origins in a naturalistic vocabulary of forms. Thus, the fishlike crescent and the lancing black diagonal that crosses it, which appear also in the related Red Oval of 1920 (Collection Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York), may recall the boat with oars in earlier works. However, the motifs are stripped of their representational meaning and do not contribute to an interpretation of the whole in terms of realistic content.The title isolates a detail of the composition, the white cross at upper right, a formal consequence of the checkerboard pattern (a recurrent motif in works of this period). In this instance negative space is treated as positive form. Once the cross of the title is seen, one begins to perceive throughout the work a proliferation of others, varying in degrees of explicitness. Though Kandinsky, like Kazimir Malevich, uses it as an abstract element, the cross is an evocative, symbolic form.The viewers compulsion to read imagery literally is used to unexpected ends by Kandinsky, who includes two signs resembling the numeral 3 upended and affixed to directional arrows. The variations in direction of the resulting forms suggest the rotation of the entire canvas. The antigravitational feeling of floating forms and the placement of elements on a planar support against an indefinite background in White Cross reveal affinities with Malevichs Suprematist works.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nPaul Klees persistent shifts in style, technique, and subject matter indicate a deliberate and highly playful evasion of aesthetic categorization. Nevertheless, it is virtually impossible to confuse a work by Klee with one by any other artist, even though many have emulated his idiosyncratic, enigmatic art. So accepted was his work that Klee was embraced over the years by the Blue Rider group, the European Dada contingent, the Surrealists, and the Bauhaus faculty, with whom he taught for a decade in Weimar and Dessau.As part of the early 20th-century avant-garde, Klee formulated a personal abstract pictorial language. His vocabulary, which oscillates freely between the figurative and the nonrepresentational, communicates through a unique symbology that is more expressive than descriptive. Klee conveyed his meanings through an often whimsical fusion of form and text, frequently writing the titles to his works on the mats upon which they are mounted and including words within the images themselves. Such is the case with The Bavarian Don Giovanni, in which Klee indicated his admiration for the Mozart opera as well as for certain contemporary sopranos, while hinting at his own amorous pursuits. A veiled self-portrait, the figure climbing the ladder is surrounded by five womens names, an allusion to the operatic scene in which Don Giovannis servant Leporello recites a list of his masters 2,065 love affairs. Citing Klees confession that his infatuations changed with every soubrette at the opera, art historian K. Porter Aichele has identified the Emma and Theres of the watercolor as the singers Emma Carelli and Therese Rothauser. The othersCenzl, Kathi, and Marirefer to models with whom Klee had fleeting romantic interludes.Although much of Klees work is figurative, compositional design nearly always preceded narrative association. The artist often transformed his experiments in tonal value and line into visual anecdotes. Red Balloon, for example, is at once a cluster of delicately colored, floating geometric shapes and a charming cityscape. Runner at the Goal is an essay in simultaneity; overlapping and partially translucent bars of color illustrate the consecutive gestures of a figure in motion. The flailing arms and sprinting legs add a comic touch to this figure, on whose forehead the number one promises a winning finish.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMondrian was a member of the Dutch De Stijl movement from its inception in 1917. By the early 1920s, in line with De Stijl practice, he restricted his compositions to predominantly off-white grounds divided by black horizontal and vertical lines that often framed subsidiary blocks of individual primary colors. Tableau 2 (1922), a representative example of this period, demonstrates the artists rejection of mimesis, which he considered a reprehensibly deceptive imitation of reality.In 1918 Mondrian created his first losangique paintings, such as the later Composition No. 1: Lozenge with Four Lines (1930), by tilting a square canvas 45 degrees. Most of these diamond-shaped works were created in 1925 and 1926 following his break with the De Stijl group over Theo van Doesburgs introduction of the diagonal. Mondrian felt that in so doing van Doesburg had betrayed the movements fundamental principles, thus forfeiting the static immutability achieved through stable verticals and horizontals. Mondrian asserted, however, that his own rotated canvases maintained the desired equilibrium of the grid, while the 45-degree turn allowed for longer lines.Art historian Rosalind Krauss identifies the grid as a structure that has remained emblematic of the modernist ambition.1 She notes that of these paintings by Mondrian, whose work has become synonymous with the grid, two signal opposing generative tendencies. Composition No. 1: Lozenge with Four Lines, in which the lines intersect just beyond the picture plane (suggesting that the work is taken from a larger whole), exemplifies a centrifugal disposition of the grid; Tableau 2, whose lines stop short of the pictures edges (implying that it is a self-contained unit), evinces a centripetal tendency. Krauss argues that these dual and conflicting readings of the grid embody the central conflict of Mondriansand indeed of modernismsambition: to represent properties of materials or perception while also responding to a higher, spiritual call. The grids mythic power, Krauss asserts, is that it makes us able to think we are dealing with materialism (or sometimes science, or logic) while at the same time it provides us with a release into belief (or illusion, or fiction).Jennifer Blessing1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nEl Lissitzky was the Russian avant-gardes unofficial emissary to the West, traveling and lecturing extensively on behalf of Russias modern artists who believed that abstraction was a harbinger of utopian social values. Basing himself in Berlin and Hanover in the 1920s, Lissitzky helped produce publications and organize exhibitions promoting both Russian and Western art that shared a common vision of aesthetics steeped in technology, mass production, and social transformation.While Lissitzky was teaching architecture and graphic design at the Artistic Technical Institute in Vitebsk, his art shifted from figuration to geometric abstraction. Under the tutelage of Suprematist painter Kazimir Malevich, Lissitzky began a body of work he would later call Prouns (an acronym for Project for the Affirmation of the New in Russian). These nonobjective compositions broadened Malevichs Suprematist credo of pure painting as spiritually transcendent into an interdisciplinary system of two-dimensional, architectonic forms rendered in painted collages, drawings, and prints, with both utopian and utilitarian aspirations. Blurring the distinctions between real and abstract spacea zone that Lissitzky called the interchange station between painting and architecturethe Prouns dwell upon the formal examination of transparency, opacity, color, shape, line, and materiality, which Lissitzky ultimately extended into three-dimensional installations that transformed our experience of conventional, gravity-based space. Occasionally endowed with cryptic titles reflecting an interest in science and mathematics, these works seem engineered rather than drawn by handfurther evidence of the artists growing conviction that art was above all rational rather than intuitive or emotional.Proun (Entwurf zu Proun S.K.) is exemplary of Lissitzkys unique enterprise. One of two studies for a larger oil painting, this composition uses different mediums to suggest a range of properties for the otherwise straightforward geometric forms, which become dynamic through their suspension within a precariously balanced visual field. Like all of the Prouns, this work is a highly refined object. Thus, while they parallel certain tenets of the Russian Constructivists, who used a similarly reductive visual vocabulary and sought to merge art and life through mass production and industry, Lissitzkys Prouns lack the rough-hewn experimental nature of Contructivist objects, remaining more on the side of aesthetics than utility.Matthew Drutt\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nNaum Gabo became a leading exponent of Constructivismwhich viewed space as a continuum rather than a monolithic volumeafter returning to Russia following the Revolution of 1917. Born Naum Neemia Pevsner and younger brother of artist Antoine Pevsner, he had originally trained to be an engineer. While traveling in Europe, he studied building techniques and observed emerging modernist currents, both inspiring him to become a sculptor. In 1920, five years after he created and signed his first construction as Gabo, he and Pevsner published in Moscow the  \"Realisticheskii manifest\" (\"Realistic Manifesto\"), which articulated their theories on Constructivism and solidified Gabos role as a pioneer of modern sculpture.\nGabo considered Column (ca. 1923), of which several versions exist, to be significant to his artistic development. For him, the work represented the height of his search for an image which would fuse the sculptural element with the architectural element into one unit. Originally intended as a maquette for a monument that was never built, it was made after Gabo had immigrated to Germany. Rather than carving it out of a single block, he built Column up into space by means of a rational geometric vocabulary. The result is a virtually symmetrical sculpture composed of transparent and intersecting vertical planes, exposing the works axial center.\nLinear Construction in Space No. 1 (ca. 194546) further emphasizes Gabos predilection for modern building supplies, as opposed to traditional ones like marble, clay, or bronze. The rigid Perspex frame with stretched nylon filaments, a design that characterizes Gabos later spherical works, again creates the illusion of continuous depth. This work too exists in several reconstructions executed after the initial template, like the version now at the Guggenheim Museum. Gabos duplication of forms and insistence on everyday materials is akin to the methodical processes of industrial production.\nUltimately, utopian ideals underscore Gabos Constructivist works. Rejecting the past and freeing art from the imitation of nature, he believed that his sculptures helped build more perfected social and spiritual life. His plastic sculptures are not just literally transparent in surface quality. In dematerializing mass and surface, he also meant to provide a conduit to a new realitya universal reality. Strongly influenced by fellow artist Vasily Kandinsky, who promoted the spiritual nature of art making, Gabo aimed to produce objects that appeal more to our minds and our feelings than to our crude physical senses.\nMegan Fontanella\n",

The emphasis on geometric forms, promoted by artists such as Kazimir Malevich, Aleksandr Rodchenko, and Liubov Popova in an effort to establish a universal aesthetic language, inspired Kandinsky to expand his own pictorial vocabulary.

This conflict led him to return to Germany in 1921. In the Black Square, executed two years later, epitomizes Kandinskys synthesis of Russian avant-garde art and his own lyrical abstraction: the white trapezoid recalls Malevichs Suprematist paintings, but the dynamic compositional elements, resembling clouds, mountains, sun, and a rainbow, still refer to the landscape.In 1922 Kandinsky joined the faculty of the Weimar Bauhaus, where he discovered a more sympathetic environment in which to pursue his art. Originally premised on a Germanic, expressionistic approach to artmaking, the Bauhaus aesthetic came to reflect Constructivist concerns and styles, which by the mid-1920s had become international in scope. While there, Kandinsky furthered his investigations into the correspondence between colors and forms and their psychological and spiritual effects. In Composition 8, the colorful, interactive geometric forms create a pulsating surface that is alternately dynamic and calm, aggressive and quiet. The importance of circles in this painting prefigures the dominant role they would play in many subsequent works, culminating in his cosmic and harmonious image Several Circles.

His cultural and religious legacy is illuminated by the figure of the violinist dancing in a rustic village. The Chabad Hasidim of Chagalls childhood believed it possible to achieve communion with God through music and dance, and the fiddler was a vital presence in ceremonies and festivals.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nDuring the summer of 1923 Joan Miro began painting The Tilled Field, a view of his familys farm in Montroig, Catalonia. Although thematically related to his earlier quasi-realistic, Fauvist-colored rural views, such as Prades, The Village, this painting is the first example of Miros Surrealist vision. Its fanciful juxtaposition of human, animal, and vegetal forms and its array of schematized creatures constitute a realm visible only to the minds eye, and reveal the great range of Miros imagination. While working on the painting he wrote, I have managed to escape into the absolute of nature. The Tilled Field is thus a poetic metaphor that expresses Miro's idyllic conception of his homeland, where, he said, he could not conceive of the wrongdoings of mankind.The complex iconography of The Tilled Field has myriad sources, and attests to Miros long-standing interest in his artistic heritage. The muted, contrasting tones of the painting recall the colors of Catalan Romanesque frescoes, while the overt flatness of the paintingspace is suggested by three horizontal bands indicating sky, sea, and earthand the decorative scattering of multicolored animals throughout were most likely inspired by medieval Spanish tapestries. These lively creatures are themselves derived from Catalan ceramics, which Miro collected and kept in his studio. The stylized figure with a plow has its source in the prehistoric cave paintings of Altamira, which Miro knew well. Even the enormous eye peering through the foliage of the pine tree, and the eye-covered pine cone beneath it, can be traced to examples of early Christian art, in which the wings of angels were bedecked with many tiny eyes. Miro found something alive and magical in all things: the gigantic ear affixed to the trunk of the tree, for example, reflects his belief that every object contains a living soul.Miros spirited depiction of The Tilled Field also has political content. The three flagsFrench, Catalan, and Spanishrefer to Catalonias attempts to secede from the central Spanish government. Primo de Rivera, who assumed Spains dictatorship in 1923, instituted strict measures, such as banning the Catalan language and flag, to repress Catalan separatism. By depicting the Catalan and French flags together, across the border post from the Spanish flag, Miro announced his allegiance to the Catalan cause.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nPaul Klees vacation in Sicily during the summer of 1924 provided him with the subjects for several watercolors that capture the color, light, and mood of a specific geographical location and cast of characters. This portrait and that of Frau R. on a Journey to the South, also of 1924 (present whereabouts unknown), are good-natured caricatures of what might be two prim northern ladies whose absurd hats insufficiently shield them from the intensity of the Mediterranean sun.The registers that break Frau R. into horizontal sections do not so rigidly stratify Frau P.; her hat dips at a jaunty angle. The vivid, warm color that thickens and thins atmospherically over the surface of the page is incised with simplified graphic contours. The black smudges on the surface result from the use of a transfer technique often employed by Klee in this period. In this technique, one side of a sheet of paper was coated with black oil and laid against a blank support. Then a drawing was placed on top of these two layers and its lines traced with a stylus, transferring the outline to the lower sheet.1 Finally, watercolor was added.The heart shape on Frau P.s chest appears frequently in Klees work, sometimes as a mouth, nose, or torso. The motif bridged the organic and inorganic worlds for the artist by symbolizing life forces while serving as a mediating form between circle and rectangle.2Lucy Flint1. See J.

    "description": "\nDescription\nLaszlo Moholy-Nagys utopian view that the transformative powers of art could be harnessed for collective social reforma tenet embedded in much Modernist theoryreflected his early association with the leftist Hungarian group MA (Today), a coalition of artists devoted to the fusion of art and political activism. It was also tied to his long-standing affiliation with the Bauhaus, the German artistic and educational community founded by Walter Gropius and dedicated to the development of a universally accessible design vocabulary. With his Bauhaus colleagues, who included Josef Albers, Vasily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and Oskar Schlemmer, he strove to define an objective science of essential forms, colors, and materials, the use of which would promote a more unified social environment.Moholy-Nagy firmly believed that the art of the present must parallel contemporary reality in order to successfully communicate meaning to a public surrounded by new technological advancements. Hence, he considered traditional, mimetic painting and sculpture obsolete and turned to pure geometric abstraction filtered through the stylistic influence of Russian Constructivism. Inspired by the structural and formal capacities of modern, synthetic materials, Moholy-Nagy experimented with transparent and opaque plastics, particularly Celluloid, Bakelite, Trolitan, and Plexiglas. In 1923 he created his first painting on clear plastic, giving physical form to his profound interest in the effects of light, which would later be manifest in film and photography as well as in transparent sculptures, such as the kinetic Dual Form with Chromium Rods. A II and AXL II illustrate how Moholy-Nagy translated his efforts to manipulate light as a new plastic medium onto the painted canvas. In the first painting, the colored parallelograms and circles appear to be almost translucent as one plane overlaps the next and their hues shift accordingly. In the second, the intersecting transparent forms read as converging beams of light. A sense of layered space, echoing the artists three-dimensional plastic paintings constructed with clear, projecting planes, was thus achieved. The contrived play of shadow and illumination on these canvases underscores the artists conviction that light could be harnessed as an effective aesthetic medium, just as color in painting and tone in music.Nancy Spector \r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nOne year before Picasso painted the monumental still life Mandolin and Guitar, Cubisms demise was announced during a Dada soiree in Paris by an audience member who shouted that Picasso [was] dead on the field of battle; the evening ended in a riot, which could be quelled only by the arrival of the police. Picassos subsequent series of nine vibrantly colored still lifes (192425), executed in a bold Synthetic Cubist style of overlapping and contiguous forms, discredited such a judgment and asserted the enduring value of the technique. But the artist was not simply resuscitating his previous discoveries in creating this new work; the rounded, organic shapes and saturated hues attest to his appreciation of contemporary developments in Surrealist painting, particularly as evinced in the work of Andre Masson and Joan Miro. The undulating lines, ornamental patterns, and broad chromatic elements of Mandolin and Guitar foretell the emergence of a fully evolved sensual, biomorphic style in Picassos art, which would soon celebrate the presence of his new mistress, Marie-Therese Walter.When Picasso met Marie-Therese on January 11, 1927 in front of Galeries Lafayette in Paris, she was 17 years old. As he was married at the time and she only a teenager, they were compelled to conceal their intense love affair. While their illicit liaison was hidden from public view, its earliest years are documented, albeit covertly, in Picassos work. Five still lifes painted during 1927incorporating the monograms MT and MTP as part of their compositionscryptically announce the entry of Marie-Therese into the artists life. By 1931 explicit references to her fecund, supple body and blond tresses appear in harmonious, voluptuous images such as Woman with Yellow Hair. Marie-Therese became a constant theme; she was portrayed reading, gazing into a mirror, and, most often, sleeping, which for Picasso was the most intimate of depictions.The abbreviated delineation of her profilea continuous, arched line from forehead to nosebecame Picassos emblem for his subject, and appears in numerous sculptures, prints, and paintings of his mistress. Rendered in a sweeping, curvilinear style, this painting of graceful repose is not so much a portrait of Marie-Therese the person as it is Picassos abstract, poetic homage to his young muse.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nGeorges Vantongerloo, who accepted the De Stijl restriction of line to horizontal and vertical in 1919, based his sculpture on the volumetric translation of this principle. The variation of volume and proportion in his work was determined geometrically, often according to mathematical formulae. Mathematics was for Vantongerloo a convention that established order in the world, a rationalization of nature that could be combined successfully with an aesthetic intention to result in the production of a work of art. In this approach he felt closest to the medieval artist who composed within the constraints of geometric convention, and to the ancient Egyptians, whose solution to the problem of the pyramid of Cheops consisted in the inscribed and circumscribed squares of a circle.1In one of his books Vantongerloo juxtaposed a diagram for the present work with an analytic sketch of the rose window at the cathedral of Amiens.2 The asymmetry of the De Stijl image distinguishes it from the medieval subject. As the diagram shows and the title indicates, the extensions of the sculpture are determined by the lines of the inscribed and circumscribed squares of a circle. The relationships of its volumes result as much from the creative selectivity of the artist as from mathematical regulation. The effects of changing light produce subtle coloristic modulation and a relationship with the environment approaching that of architecture.Lucy Flint1. G.

His desire for the unrestricted use of color as well as his growing interest in abstraction led him to execute several monumental murals intended for public settings in 1924. Leger presented his first murals in Paris in 1925 at the Exposition internationale des arts decoratifs, in the Pavillon de l'Esprit Nouveau designed by architect Le Corbusier. In general, Leger claimed, pure colors and geometric forms are not compatible with easel painting. Abstraction requires large surfaces, walls. There one can organize an architecture and a rhythm.1 While it is not known whether he conceived Mural Painting (Peinture murale, 192425) for a specific site, the influence of modernist architectural theorists, and in particular Le Corbusier, is evident. Seeking to lend a sense of rhythm to a static space, Leger designed vertical and horizontal bands of color that vitalize the pictorial plane and suggest expansion or recession. In this regard, the mural effectively destroys the rigidity of the rectangle and the blank wall.\n1. Fernand Leger, 18811955, exh. cat. (Paris: Musee des arts decoratifs, 1956), p. 33.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nJean Arp participated in Dada activities in Zurich during the second decade of the 20th century; during the mid-twenties, he allied himself to a certain extent with Surrealism, which had assimilated many of the tendencies of Dada. Although Arp resisted the program of the Surrealists, he shared their faith in unfettered creativity, their celebration of spontaneity, and their antirational stance. He executed his first monochrome wood reliefs in 1914, adding the element of color two years later. Composed of discrete wood forms mounted individually on wood supports, these reliefs are assembled like collages rather than carved. Arp continued to make reliefs throughout his life. By combining aspects of painting, collage, and sculpture, the reliefs of the teens and twenties served in some sense as a bridge to his sculpture in the round. Arp regarded his simplified forms as emblems of natural growth processes. As he wrote, \"I looked for new constellations of form such as nature never stops producing. I tried to make forms grow. I put my trust in the example of seeds, stars, clouds, plants, animals, men, and finally in my innermost being.\"1 According to Arp, his works carried their own momentum and arrived at organic solutions subject as much to the laws of chance as to his conscious manipulations. He commented on the \"ridiculous\" analogies of forms that resulted from this process; his descriptive titles, such as that of the present work and Shirt Front and Fork (Plastron et fourchette, 1922) or Dress with Eye and Navel (Robe a oeil et nombril, 192526), were often correspondingly whimsical.

His predilection for military hardware and its gleaming surfaces corresponded with his feelings of solidarity with the foot soldiers surrounding him in the trenches. The machine aesthetic he adopted at this time reflected his hopes of creating a truly popular art form that would describe and invigorate modern life. After the war, he turned away from the experiments with pure abstraction that characterize his earlier work and infused his art with social meaning; quasi-representational motifs emerged in lively paintings depicting soldiers, factory workers, bargemen, and pulsating urban environments. In works such as The City of 1919, The Mechanic of 1920, and Composition (definitive state) of 1925, Leger incorporated elements of Cubist fragmentation into his new pristine, mechanical syntax to evoke the energy of contemporary experience. In Composition, Leger experimented with a complex arrangement of overlapping geometric shapessome rounded to evoke pipes, or bolts, but all effectively and resolutely abstract.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nDuring the mid- to late 1920s Joan Miro developed a private system of imagery in which the motifs have symbolic meanings that vary according to their context. By studying the constellations of these motifs, one is encouraged to infer meanings appropriate to a particular painting.In Painting two personages (the designation Miro used for his abstract figures) and a flame have been identified. The personage on the right can perhaps be read as a female because of the curvaceous nature of the eight-shape, and by analogy with forms in other paintings that are specifically identified by the artist as women. The black dot with radiating lines can be interpreted as the figures eye receiving rays of light, or as a bodily or verbal emission. The same motif appears in Personage, also of 1925, in the collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. Moons, stars, suns, or planets float at the upper left of several canvases of the mid-1920s. In the present work the semicircular orange-red image not only carries a cosmic implication, but also possibly doubles as the head of the second personage, probably a male. This head is presented in a combined full-face and profile view, in the manner of Pablo Picassos Cubist portraits.The flame, used repeatedly by Miro in this period, may signify sexual excitation in this context. The erotic content that prevails in much of his work in 1925 is particularly explicit in the Lovers series, in which two figures approach each other or are united in sexual embrace. The two figures in Painting are less clearly conjoined. The submersion of legible subject matter and the ambiguity of the paintings meaning transfer the emphasis to the purely abstract qualities of the work. Line and color articulate a language as complex and poetic as the hieroglyphic signs that constitute the imagery. The generalized ground, rich in texture from the uneven thinning of paint and the use of shadowy black, provides a warm and earthy support for the expressive black lines, the areas of red and yellow, and the staccato rhythm of dots.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1925 Miros work took a decisive turn, stimulated, according to the artist, by hunger-induced hallucinations involving his impressions of poetry. These resulted in the artists dream paintings, such as Personage (Personnage), in which ghostly figures hover in a bluish ether. Miro explored Surrealist automatism in these canvases, attempting to freely transcribe his wandering imagination without preconceived notions. Although these images are highly schematic, they are not without references to real things, as the artist made clear. For me a form is never something abstract, he said in 1948. It is always a sign of something. It is always a man, a bird, or something else.1 In these works Miro began to develop his own language of enigmatic signs: the forms in Personage depict a large vestigial foot and a head with three teeth in its grinning mouth. The star shape often represents female genitalia in Miros oeuvre, and the dot with four rays symbolizes the vision of a disembodied eye.Two years later Miro reverted to imagery somewhat more grounded in reality. In Landscape (The Hare) (Paysage [Le Lievre]), among other works, he also returned to one of his favorite subjects, the countryside around his familys home in Catalonia. Miro said that he was inspired to paint this canvas when he saw a hare dart across a field on a summer evening. In Landscape (The Hare), this event has been transformed to emphasize the unfolding of a heavenly event. A primeval terrain of acid oranges and red is the landscape in which a hare with bulging eyes stares transfixed by a spiraling comet.By the late 1940s Miro was making canvases on a much larger scale and with broader markings. Painting (Peinture) of 1953 is more than 6 feet high by 12 feet wide and is characterized by loose, gestural brushstrokes and stained pigments. The calligraphic drawing style and open field of works such as Personage has, in Painting, metamorphosed into bold, energetic lines in a vast, cosmic atmosphere. Yet the star and sun, the animal-like forms, and the sprays of dots are signs of the artists symbolic language developed in the 1920s.Jennifer Blessing1.

The direction consequently taken by Neo-Plasticism was designated Elementarism by van Doesburg, who described its method of construction as based on the neutralization of positive and negative directions by the diagonal and, as far as color is concerned, by the dissonant. Equilibrated relations are not an ultimate result.1 Mondrian considered this redefinition of Neo-Plasticism heretical; he was soon to resign from the De Stijl group.This canvas upholds the Neo-Plastic dictum of peripheric composition. The focus is decentralized and there are no empty, inactive areas. The geometric planes are emphasized equally, related by contrasts of color, scale, and direction. Ones eyes follow the trajectories of isosceles triangles and stray beyond the canvas to complete mentally the larger triangles sliced off by its edges. The placement of the vertical axis to the left of center and the barely off-square proportions of the support create a sense of shifting balance.Lucy Flint1. Quoted in Hans Ludwig C.

His use of collage in the 1910s provided formal innovations in paintings of the twenties. In still lifes such as the present example, he constructed objects with broad, frontal planes that remain discrete and are often vividly colored or decoratively patterned.In subject matter, The Bowl of Grapes belongs to Braques gueridon (round pedestal table) and mantelpiece series of about 1918 to 1929. It displays a rigorous and complex organization of shape and line combined with the sensuous appeal of rich color (three greens contrasted with chalky white and tan) and a masterful handling of paint. The structuring grid is softened by broad curves and clusters of circular forms, and in peripheral areas enriched by the textural variation provided by the addition of sand to pigment.Formal rather than illusionistic needs govern the treatment of objects. The white drapery does not cascade down from the tabletop in foreshortened, shadowed folds, but rigidly asserts itself parallel to the picture plane. The distinction between lit and shadowed sides of the pitcher is artificially sharp. Reminiscent of Paul Cezannes still lifes are the heavy contours and voluminous presence of the objects, the tilted planes, inconsistent perspective, and discontinuous background lines.Lucy Flint\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlberto Giacometti was 20 years old when he settled in Paris in order to pursue the career of a sculptor. He studied classical sculpture and the predominant Cubist idioms, but it was not until he began to interpret primitive objects that he was able to liberate himself from the influence of his teachers. Spoon Woman, one of the artists first mature works, explores the metaphor employed in ceremonial spoons of the African Dan culture, in which the bowl of the utensil can be equated with a womans womb. But Giacomettis life-size sculpture reverses the equivalence. As the art historian and theorist Rosalind Krauss has noted, By taking the metaphor and inverting it, so that a spoon is like a woman becomes a woman is like a spoon, Giacometti was able to intensify the idea and to make it universal by generalizing the forms of the sometimes rather naturalistic African carvings toward a more prismatic abstraction.Giacometti joined the ranks of the Surrealists in 1929, only to break with them acrimoniously six years later, when he decided to work from models rather than strictly from his imagination. Yet even in Nose there is something of the Surrealist tendency toward the fantastic in the incredible proboscis. In this work, Giacometti suspended a head from a cross bar in a rectangular cage, thus implying that the pendant head could be prodded to swing, the nose further extending beyond the confines of its prison. There is a vague threat in the shape of the head: the configuration of nose, skull, and neck recalls the barrel, chassis, and handle of a gun. However, the wide-open mouth suggests a scream of anguish, and the cord attaching it to its cage evokes the gallows. Nose should be seen within the context of postwar existential angst that was voiced by Jean-Paul Sartre, a friend of the artist.In Diego, a painting of his brother, Giacometti continued in this vein, insinuating the loneliness caused by each individuals isolation within his own existence. Like the head in Nose, the solitary Diego is presented in the confines of a cagelike structure of lines denoting the architecture of the room. The atmosphere of melancholy is further suggested both by the artists muted palette that seems to drain life from the sitter, and the figures near-transparency in a haze of reworked paint.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWhen Kandinsky returned to his native Moscow after the outbreak of World War I, his expressive abstract style underwent changes that reflected the utopian artistic experiments of the Russian avant-garde. The emphasis on geometric forms, promoted by artists such as Kazimir Malevich, Aleksandr Rodchenko, and Liubov Popova in an effort to establish a universal aesthetic language, inspired Kandinsky to expand his own pictorial vocabulary. Although he adopted some aspects of the geometrizing trends of Suprematism and Constructivismsuch as overlapping flat planes and clearly delineated shapeshis belief in the expressive content of abstract forms alienated him from the majority of his Russian colleagues, who championed more rational, systematizing principles. This conflict led him to return to Germany in 1921. In the Black Square, executed two years later, epitomizes Kandinskys synthesis of Russian avant-garde art and his own lyrical abstraction: the white trapezoid recalls Malevichs Suprematist paintings, but the dynamic compositional elements, resembling clouds, mountains, sun, and a rainbow, still refer to the landscape.In 1922 Kandinsky joined the faculty of the Weimar Bauhaus, where he discovered a more sympathetic environment in which to pursue his art. Originally premised on a Germanic, expressionistic approach to artmaking, the Bauhaus aesthetic came to reflect Constructivist concerns and styles, which by the mid-1920s had become international in scope. While there, Kandinsky furthered his investigations into the correspondence between colors and forms and their psychological and spiritual effects. In Composition 8, the colorful, interactive geometric forms create a pulsating surface that is alternately dynamic and calm, aggressive and quiet. The importance of circles in this painting prefigures the dominant role they would play in many subsequent works, culminating in his cosmic and harmonious image Several Circles. The circle, claimed Kandinsky, is the synthesis of the greatest oppositions. It combines the concentric and the eccentric in a single form and in equilibrium. Of the three primary forms, it points most clearly to the fourth dimension.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMagic Garden was executed in 1926, the year Paul Klee resumed teaching at the Bauhaus at its new location in Dessau. During his Bauhaus period he articulated and taught a complex theoretical program that was supported and clarified by his painting and drawing. Theory, in turn, served to elucidate his art. Based on probing investigation and carefully recorded observation, his work in both areas reveals analogies among the properties of natural, of man-made, and of geometric forms.Studies of plants illustrating growth processes appear often in Klees notebooks as well as in his paintings and drawings. He was also interested in architecture and combined images of buildings with vegetal forms in Magic Garden and several other works of 1926. Pictorial motifs often arise from geometric exercises: the goblet shape that dominates the lower center of this composition appeared also in a nonrepresentational drawing exploring the development from point to line to surface to volume.The surface Klee creates with the medium of Magic Garden resembles that of a primordial substance worn and textured by its own history. A cosmic eruption seems to have spewed forth forms that are morphologically related but differentiated into various genera. Although excused from the laws of gravity, each of these forms occupies a designated place in a new universe, simultaneously as fixed and mobile as the orbits of planets or the nuclei of organic cells. Klees cosmic statements are gleefully irreverent; he writes of his work: Ethical gravity rules, along with hobgoblin laughter at the learned ones.Lucy Flint1. Quoted in W.

    "description": "\nDescription\nFrom humorously clinical depictions of erotic events in the Dada period, such as Little Machine Constructed by Minimax Dadamax in Person, Max Ernst moved on to celebrations of uninhibited sexuality in his Surrealist works. His liaison and marriage with the young Marie-Berthe Aurenche in 1927 may have inspired the erotic subject matter of this painting and others of this year. The major compositional lines of this work may have been determined by the configurations of string that Ernst dropped on a preparatory surface, a procedure according with Surrealist notions of the importance of chance effects. However, Ernst used a coordinate grid system to transfer his string configurations to canvas, thus subjecting these chance effects to conscious manipulation. Visually, the technique produces undulating calligraphic rhythms, like those traced here against the glowing earth and sky colors.The centralized, pyramidal grouping and the embracing gesture of the upper figure in The Kiss have lent themselves to comparison with Renaissance compositions, specifically the Madonna and Saint Anne by Leonardo da Vinci (Collection Musee National du Louvre, Paris).1 The Leonardo work was the subject of a psychosexual interpretation by Sigmund Freud, whose writings were important to Ernst and other Surrealists. The adaptation of a religious subject would add an edge of blasphemy to the exuberant lasciviousness of Ernsts picture.Lucy Flint1. See the interpretation of this work by N. and E.

    "description": "\nDescription\nFernand Legers use of streamlined forms derived from mechanical imagery dates from World War I, when he served in the French army. His predilection for military hardware and its gleaming surfaces coincided with his feelings of solidarity with the foot soldiers surrounding him in the trenches. The machine aesthetic he adopted at this time reflected his hopes of creating a truly popular art form that would describe and inspire modern life. After the war, he turned away from the experiments with pure abstraction that characterized his earlier work and infused social meaning into his art; quasi-representational motifs emerged in lively paintings depicting soldiers, factory workers, bargemen, and pulsating urban environments. In works such as The City of 1919 and The Mechanic of 1920, Leger incorporated elements of Cubist fragmentation into his new pristine, mechanical syntax to evoke the energy of contemporary experience.As a call to order resounded throughout postwar French society, Leger introduced the monumental, classical figure into his art. The absolute calm and stasis of Woman Holding a Vase demonstrates his affinities with the neo-antique depictions of women by his contemporaries Pablo Picasso and Gino Severini. It also shows Legers sympathies with the Purist ideals of Amedee Ozenfant and Le Corbusier, who called for a revival of classical aesthetic consonance as a symbol of renewed social harmony. Legers palette of blue, yellow, red, and black is indebted to Piet Mondrians concurrent De Stijl paintings, further evincing Legers identification with utopian and reconstructivist ideals of the 1920s and 1930s.The result of over one hundred preparatory studies dating from as early as 1947, The Great Parade is a defining work within the artists oeuvre. The joyful parade motif evolved out of several preceding themes in Legers oeuvreincluding cyclists, country outings, and the circusthat celebrated the leisure activities of the working class. The circus in particular is an accessible arena in which all spectators are equal, brought together in their delight over the clowns, trapeze artists, and animal acts. In this mural-size canvasconceived on a scale appropriate to mass viewingthe interlocking figures perform their inspired feats along a horizontal swathe of blue, which is punctuated by a large red C for cirque. The final version of The Great Parade, painted one year before the artists death, is the culmination of his career-long endeavor to both represent and reach a public beyond the small circle of connoisseurs familiar with fine art.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1925 Miros work took a decisive turn, stimulated, according to the artist, by hunger-induced hallucinations involving his impressions of poetry. These resulted in the artists dream paintings, such as Personage, in which ghostly figures hover in a bluish ether. Miro explored Surrealist automatism in these canvases, attempting to freely transcribe his wandering imagination without preconceived notions. Although these images are highly schematic, they are not without references to real things, as the artist made clear. For me a form is never something abstract, he said in 1948. It is always a sign of something. It is always a man, a bird, or something else. In these works Miro began to develop his own language of enigmatic signs: the forms in Personage depict a large vestigial foot and a head with three teeth in its grinning mouth. The star shape often represents female genitalia in Miros oeuvre, and the dot with four rays symbolizes the vision of a disembodied eye.Two years later Miro reverted to imagery somewhat more grounded in reality. In Landscape (The Hare), among other works, he also returned to one of his favorite subjects, the countryside around his familys home in Catalonia. Miro said that he was inspired to paint this canvas when he saw a hare dart across a field on a summer evening. In Landscape (The Hare), this event has been transformed to emphasize the unfolding of a heavenly event. A primeval terrain of acid oranges and red is the landscape in which a hare with bulging eyes stares transfixed by a spiraling comet.By the late 1940s Miro was making canvases on a much larger scale and with broader markings. Painting of 1953 is more than 6 feet high by 12 feet wide and is characterized by loose, gestural brushstrokes and stained pigments. The calligraphic drawing style and open field of works such as Personage has, in Painting, metamorphosed into bold, energetic lines in a vast, cosmic atmosphere. Yet the star and sun, the animal-like forms, and the sprays of dots are signs of the artists symbolic language developed in the 1920s.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nLaszlo Moholy-Nagys utopian view that the transformative powers of art could be harnessed for collective social reforma tenet embedded in much Modernist theoryreflected his early association with the leftist Hungarian group MA (Today), a coalition of artists devoted to the fusion of art and political activism. It was also tied to his long-standing affiliation with the Bauhaus, the German artistic and educational community founded by Walter Gropius and dedicated to the development of a universally accessible design vocabulary. With his Bauhaus colleagues, who included Josef Albers, Vasily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and Oskar Schlemmer, he strove to define an objective science of essential forms, colors, and materials, the use of which would promote a more unified social environment.Moholy-Nagy firmly believed that the art of the present must parallel contemporary reality in order to successfully communicate meaning to a public surrounded by new technological advancements. Hence, he considered traditional, mimetic painting and sculpture obsolete and turned to pure geometric abstraction filtered through the stylistic influence of Russian Constructivism. Inspired by the structural and formal capacities of modern, synthetic materials, Moholy-Nagy experimented with transparent and opaque plastics, particularly Celluloid, Bakelite, Trolitan, and Plexiglas. In 1923 he created his first painting on clear plastic, giving physical form to his profound interest in the effects of light, which would later be manifest in film and photography as well as in transparent sculptures, such as the kinetic Dual Form with Chromium Rods. A II and AXL II illustrate how Moholy-Nagy translated his efforts to manipulate light as a new plastic medium onto the painted canvas. In the first painting, the colored parallelograms and circles appear to be almost translucent as one plane overlaps the next and their hues shift accordingly. In the second, the intersecting transparent forms read as converging beams of light. A sense of layered space, echoing the artists three-dimensional plastic paintings constructed with clear, projecting planes, was thus achieved. The contrived play of shadow and illumination on these canvases underscores the artists conviction that light could be harnessed as an effective aesthetic medium, just as color in painting and tone in music.Nancy Spector \r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAndre Bretons Surrealist Manifesto of 1924 proclaimed pure psychic automatism as an artistic ideal, emphasizing inspiration derived from the chance juxtaposition of forms and the haphazard use of materials. Max Ernst came under the influence of Bretons ideas in 1924, and soon thereafter developed his frottage or rubbing technique.1 In making his first frottages, he dropped pieces of paper at random on floor boards and rubbed them with pencil or chalk, thus transferring the design of the wood grain to the paper. He next adapted this technique to oil painting, scraping paint from prepared canvases laid over materials such as wire mesh, chair caning, leaves, buttons, or twine. His repertory of objects closely parallels that used by Man Ray in his experiments with Rayograms during the same period. Using his grattage (scraping) technique, Ernst covered his canvases completely with pattern and then interpreted the images that emerged, thus allowing texture to suggest composition in a spontaneous fashion. In The Forest the artist probably placed the canvas over a rough surface (perhaps wood), scraped oil paint over the canvas, and then rubbed, scraped, and overpainted the area of the trees.The subject of a dense forest appears often in Ernsts work of the late twenties and early thirties. These canvases, of which The Quiet Forest, 1927, is another example, generally contain a wall of trees, a solar disk, and an apparition of a bird hovering amid the foliage. Ernsts attitude toward the forest as the sublime embodiment of both enchantment and terror can be traced to his experiences in the German forest as a child.2 His essay Les Mysteres de la foret, published in Minotaure in 1934, vividly conveys his fascination with the various kinds of forests. The Peggy Guggenheim canvas resonates with those qualities he identified with the forests of Oceania: They are, it seems, savage and impenetrable, black and russet, extravagant, secular, swarming, diametrical, negligent, ferocious, fervent, and likeable, without yesterday or tomorrow. . . . Naked, they dress only in their majesty and their mystery (authors translation).Elizabeth C. Childs1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nOne fortuitous event associated with Alexander Calders 196465 retrospective at the Guggenheim was the rediscovery of two wire sculptures made in 1928: Romulus and Remus and Spring (both are now in the museums collection). A few years after he constructed these witty, figurative works, Calder stored them away in a closet. On retrieving them he commented, Id always thought these particularly humorous, but now they look like good sculpture. Romulus and Remus represents the mythological founders of Rome being suckled by a protective she-wolf. This scene, often depicted in Western art, is rendered here in a most whimsical manner: both the boys genitals and the wolfs nipples are represented by wooden doorstops. The sculptures armature consists of a single wire that is twisted and bent to suggest both volume and void. Romulus and Remus is a drawing executed in space; its calligraphic outline is the equivalent of Calders rapid, abbreviated pencil-and-pen sketches of acrobats and animals. Although entertaining and uncomplicated in execution, it explores issues critical to 20th-century sculpture: the interchangeability of space and mass, translucency, and the relation of two- to three-dimensionality. While Calder experimented with other unusual materials, his favorite medium was wire. Its flexibility and capacity to vibrate may have inspired his kinetic sculptures.Dating from 1932, Calders first hanging sculptures of discrete movable parts powered by the wind were christened mobiles by Marcel Duchamp. It is now a vernacular art form, but when Calder invented it the mobile was viewed as an avant-garde achievement, a sculptural counterpart to Joan Miros paintings of buoyant, biomorphic figures and Jean Arps abstract reliefs. Although they are nonfigurative, Calders hanging mobiles, particularly the monumental yet delicate Red Lily Pads, retain references to the natural world: the dancing and spinning of the disks evoke the intangible qualities of the air that propels them. According to art historian Rosalind Krauss, the mobilesas interconnected vertical structures in spacecreate a sense of volume analogous to that of the human body. In their surrender to the pull of gravity and their displacement of space through motion, the mobiles become anthropomorphic metaphors.Nancy Spector\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWhen Alexander Calder first exhibited Spring (Printemps, 1928) along with other wire creations in the 1928 exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists, the New York Times heralded the arrival of his nontraditional sculptural materials in a review declaring Copper wire and bureau drawer knobs made their first appearance as mediums of artistic expression yesterday. Calder, the son and grandson of classical sculptors, attributed his turn away from modeling clay or mud to his childhood as a boy in the midst of my family, always enthusiastic about toys and string, and always a junkman of bits of wire and all the prettiest stuff in the garbage can.The allegorical Spring is monumental in subject and scale, standing over seven feet tall. Like a spontaneous line drawing, her form is described by both sweeping outlines and intricate detailthe looped flower in her hand, the undulating strand of hair, or the artists clever signature dangling below her waist. In New York, audiences reportedly tugged at her breasts, wood doorstops bought at the five-and-ten-cent store, and while on view at the Salon des Independents in Paris in 1929, viewers pulled her to the side, allowing her to sway back and forth. Calder then rolled Spring into a bale with another wire sculpture and stored the works with a friend until his 196465 retrospective at the Guggenheim. According to Calder, when he disentangled the thirty-five year old Spring, she had all the freshness of youthof my youth.At the Galerie Percier in Paris in 1931, Calders earlier wire portraits of celebrated friends and personalities were hung at the ceiling, overseeing his newest work, abstractions of wire with spheres and blocks of wood, many kinetic. Calder later referred to these works as Universes. For much of the 1930s and like other artists engaged with abstraction after World War I, Calder used cosmic descriptions and scientific terminology: I felt that there was no better model for me . . . . Spheres of different sizes, densities, colors and volumes, floating in space, traversing clouds . . . currents of air, viscosities, and odorsof the greatest variety and disparity. In particular, the sphere and circular forms held the potential for cosmic or universal feeling, and Calder lamented that he couldnt suspend a sphere without any means of support. In this untitled standing mobile, the artist suspended five painted wood orbs of varied dimensions, carefully counterbalanced to appear almost weightless as they circulate and rotate in relation to each other. An imagined solar system, the work predates Calders independently hanging mobiles, where finer, less visible, wires anchored to the ceiling would replace Untitleds (1935) earthbound wooden base, inverted L-shaped support, and restricted movement.Tracey Bashkoff\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1928 Joan Miro returned to Paris from a trip to the Netherlands with several postcard reproductions of works by seventeenth-century Dutch artists. At least two of these have been identified as sources for the Dutch Interior paintings in the Museum of Modern Art, New York and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection.1 The Guggenheim work is a transformation of Jan Steens The Dancing Lesson (Collection Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) and conveys the synthesis of carefully observed, precisely executed detail and imaginative generalization of form that proceeded from Miros encounter with the Dutch Baroque. In this combination of objective minutiae and abstract vision, Dutch Interior II reverts conceptually to works of the early 1920s, such as The Tilled Field, 192324 (Collection Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York).The gradual translation of veristic detail into eccentric, evocative form can be followed through preliminary sketches of specific motifs to a meticulously complete preparatory drawing. A conspicuous modification of the Dutch original is Miros enlargement of and focus on human and animal figures and his concomitant suppression or deemphasis of inanimate objects. Thus a window at the upper center of the Steen has been greatly reduced in size, as though it had been sent hurtling through a vast space. The real subject of the Steen is not the cat, but the sound, movement, and hilarity the dancing lesson provokes. Miro seizes on this anomaly in his version: although the cat serves as the hub of his centrifugal composition, he emphasizes the cacophony and animation of the lesson through the swirling motion of myriad details and the dancing rhythm of points and counterpoints.Lucy Flint1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nFrom 1927 to 1929 Pablo Picasso elaborated a complex discourse on the activity of the artist through the theme of the studio. Among the variations in the series, the closest to the present example is The Studio of 192728 (Collection The Museum of Modern Art, New York). Both works share the vivid palette of Synthetic Cubism, limited to draw attention to a conspicuous and authoritative execution in planar areas. This painterliness contrasts with the geometrized, wirelike contours that define the figures in the manner of Picassos contemporaneous wire sculpture.The figures in the Guggenheim The Studio can be identified as a sculptured bust (at the left) and a full-length painted portrait (to the right). By depicting artistic representations of humans in a highly schematized form, Picasso places the figures at several removes from the world of living beings. He relies on the viewers willingness to believe in the reality of depicted objects, however abstract, and to imagine a human exchange or relationship between the male and female forms. Like the artist in the Museum of Modern Art version, the bust has three eyes; this may reflect Picassos personal identification with the work of art.Picassos development of the theme of the artists perception of himself and his subjects can be traced from his etching of 1927 Painter with a Model Knitting, in which a realistically drawn artist paints a fantastic and abstract portrait of a very ordinary woman. The artist becomes an abstract sign in The Studio at the Museum of Modern Art and disappears, or is at least submerged, in The Studio in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. He reappears in Painter and Model, also of 1928 (Collection The Museum of Modern Art, New York), as a figure that is even more difficult to detect, yet nonetheless is engaged in painting a relatively realistic profile. The theme of the interaction of reality and illusion explored here was a central concern for Picasso throughout his life.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlthough the relationship of photography to Josef Albers's work in other mediums has been regarded as tangential, it is now clear that for him it was an important means toward abstraction. Albers took up photography at the Bauhaus around 1928 and continued working with it until the end of his career. The medium permitted him to isolate particular phenomenaa time of year, an emotional state, a physical conditionwhich he would in turn extrapolate in his later nonobjective paintings, drawings, and prints. Albers argued that photography is the flattest of all visual arts: because of the monocular mechanics of the camera's lens, it does not render spatial illusion, making it ideal for certain aesthetic inquiries.\nHis early photographs reflect traditional Bauhaus concerns with form and materials, particularly with regard to quotidian objects. Untitled (Laundry on Clothesline) (1929) captures a moment when soft, lifeless clothing suddenly acquires volume through the otherwise invisible presence of wind. Another work that transforms the mundane into a study of contrasting properties is Let Hands Speak (summer 1930). This image takes as its subject the mannequin, a favorite icon of Dada artists, who considered it an ideal representation of mindless, characterless, bourgeois culture. But Albers found the mannequins to have a graceful, human quality that lent itself to studies in formal oppositions of hard and soft, straight and curved.\nThe compositional strategies of montage and collage were used by many Bauhaus artists as a means of rendering the frenetic nature of the modern metropolis. For Albers, these techniques were used to convey a singular concern for temporality and emotion, as evidenced in his portraits of friends and colleagues. Composed of multiple views that exploit the camera's ability to render a subject serially, Mrs. Lewandowski, Munich (1930) consists of four images of the wife of a colleague arranged to suggest the passage of time, as though lifted from a sequence of frames of a motion picture or a contact sheet. Scale is manipulated by altering the distance between the figure of the woman and the picture plane. This flattening of the subject was in keeping with Albers's increasing interest in planarity, which would manifest itself not only in photographic works but also in his celebrated abstract paintings of the following decade.\nMatthew Drutt\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nGeometric shapes and sections of circles combine in Upward in a structure suspended in a field of rich turquoise and green. A partial circle rests delicately on a pointed base. Another fragment of a circle glides along its vertical diameter, reaching beyond the circumference of the first form to penetrate the space above it. Vasily Kandinsky achieves an effect of energy rising upward, while anchoring the forms together by balancing them on either side of a continuous vertical line. In a closely related work of the same period, Depressed (Collection Galleria Marescalchi, Bologna), Kandinsky distributes motifs of partial circles horizontally. Here he represses the sense of energy found in Upward both through his composition and a subdued palette.A linear design in the upper right corner of the present canvas echoes the vertical thrust of the central motif. This configuration resembles the letter E, as does the black cutout shape at the base of the central motif. Another E shape is legible in the upper right corner of a related drawing (Collection Musee National dArt Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris). These forms may at once be independent designs and playful references to the first letter of Empor, the German title of the painting.The related drawing reveals that the small black circle and the horizontal bars of the central motif, which have the physiognomic character of eye and mouth, were not part of Kandinskys original design concept and evolved as he worked on the painting. As he wrote in 1929, the year he painted Upward, I do not choose form consciously; it chooses itself within me.1 The physiognomic character of Upward indicates Kandinskys association at the Dessau Bauhaus with fellow Blaue Vier artists Paul Klee and Alexej Jawlensky. Jawlensky showed sixteen abstract heads, a motif that appeared in his work as early as 1918, in an exhibition of the Blaue Vier at the Galerie Ferdinand Moller in Berlin in October 1929. Shown during the month when Upward was completed, these paintings offered Kandinsky the model of large, abstract faces composed of geometric planes of non-naturalistic color and accented by bar-shaped features. However, Kandinskys working method more closely resembled that of Klee, who began with intuitively chosen forms that gradually suggested counterparts in the natural world, than that of Jawlensky, who began with the model and moved toward abstraction. In particular, the whimsy of the hovering black eye in Upward and the incorporation of a letter as a pictogram with a possible reference to the title of the painting suggest the reverberations of Klees art.Elizabeth C.

    "description": "\nDescription\nAn assiduous student of music, nature, mathematics, and science, Klee applied this constellation of interests to his art at every turn. Even his purely abstract works have their own particular subject matter. In the Current Six Thresholds, an austere composition of horizontal chromatic stripes divided into smaller units and intersected by vertical bands, has been compared to landscape painting. A late Bauhaus work, it is part of a series of gridlike canvases that Klee painted after he returned from a trip to Egypt. His visual impressions of the Nile river valley are represented here through a highly schematized, geometric analogy composed of a square lattice motif and restrained tonal variations. Another geometric painting, New Harmony, demonstrates the artists long-standing interest in color theory. Such flat configurations of painted rectangles appeared in Klees work as early as 1915 and evolved as expressions of his equation of chromatic division with musical notation. This late canvas, painted in 1936, is the last such composition and, in typical Klee fashion, looks toward the new and innovative, rather than nostalgically backward. According to art historian Andrew Kagan, the composition is based on the principle of bilateral inverted symmetry (the right side of the canvas is an upside-down reflection of the left) and the tonal distribution of juxtaposed, noncomplementary colors evokes the nonthematic, monodic 12-tone music of Arnold Schonberg. Kagan notes, in conjunction with this reading, that Klee used 12 hues in New Harmony, save for the neutral gray and the black underpainting.Klee revealed a more socially and politically relevant side in his 1937 painting Revolution of the Viaduct, of which the Guggenheims Arches of the Bridge Break Ranks is an earlier version. Created when Fascism was on the rise in Europe, the image of rebellious arches escaping from the conformity of a viaduct invokes public dissension while promoting individuality. It is a flippant but foreboding reference to Albert Speers monolithic Nazi architecture as well as to official Soviet imagery of workers marching forward in unison. There is a poignant postscript to Klees social critique: after the artist fled Germany in 1937 to his native Switzerland, 17 of his works were displayed in the Nazis Degenerate Art exhibition, a show of Modern painting and sculpture that they considered too free-spirited and libertarian.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe kinetic potential of art was of primary interest to Alexander Calder throughout his career: \"Why must art be static? You look at an abstraction, sculptured or painted, an entirely exciting arrangement of planes, spheres, nuclei, entirely without meaning. It would be perfect but it is always still. The next step in sculpture is motion.\"1 Employing the language of abstraction, Calder captured movement through a range of structuresincluding mobiles, stabiles, constellations, towers, and gongsthat offered radical alternatives to the prevailing notions of sculpture and had a profound impact on the history of 20th-century art.\nWhile the extraordinary breadth of Calder's production makes it impossible to characterize his work according to any particular style or technique, he is perhaps best known as the inventor of the mobile. Calder's first mobiles, kinetic works propelled only by air circulating its balanced components, date from the early 1930s, when he lived in Paris. It was Marcel Duchamp who devised the term for these suspended sculptures; as Calder recalled, \"I asked him what sort of a name I could give these things and he at once produced 'mobile.' In addition to something that moves, in French it also means motive.\"\nCalder, a fastidious craftsman, cut, bent, punctured, and twisted his materials entirely by hand, the manual emphasis contributing to the sculptures' evocation of natural form. Shape, size, color, space, and movement combine and recombine in shifting, balanced relationships that provide a visual equivalent to the harmonious but unpredictable activity of nature. In Untitled (ca. 1934), simple wooden shapesmost of them unpaintedare suspended from metal rods. Responding to air currents, the mobile's ever shifting profile moves spontaneously and unpredictably, different elements traveling in different directions at varying rates of speed. Along with a second wood mobile in the Guggenheim Museum's collection, this work was previously owned by renowned collector of Surrealist art Mary Reynolds.\nLucy Flint\n1.

Albers took up photography at the Bauhaus around 1928 and continued working with it until the end of his career. The medium permitted him to isolate particular phenomenaa time of year, an emotional state, a physical conditionwhich he would in turn extrapolate in his later nonobjective paintings, drawings, and prints. Albers argued that photography is the flattest of all visual arts: because of the monocular mechanics of the camera's lens, it does not render spatial illusion, making it ideal for certain aesthetic inquiries.\nHis early photographs reflect traditional Bauhaus concerns with form and materials, particularly with regard to quotidian objects. Untitled (Laundry on Clothesline) (1929) captures a moment when soft, lifeless clothing suddenly acquires volume through the otherwise invisible presence of wind. Another work that transforms the mundane into a study of contrasting properties is Let Hands Speak (summer 1930). This image takes as its subject the mannequin, a favorite icon of Dada artists, who considered it an ideal representation of mindless, characterless, bourgeois culture. But Albers found the mannequins to have a graceful, human quality that lent itself to studies in formal oppositions of hard and soft, straight and curved.\nThe compositional strategies of montage and collage were used by many Bauhaus artists as a means of rendering the frenetic nature of the modern metropolis. For Albers, these techniques were used to convey a singular concern for temporality and emotion, as evidenced in his portraits of friends and colleagues. Composed of multiple views that exploit the camera's ability to render a subject serially, Mrs. Lewandowski, Munich (1930) consists of four images of the wife of a colleague arranged to suggest the passage of time, as though lifted from a sequence of frames of a motion picture or a contact sheet. Scale is manipulated by altering the distance between the figure of the woman and the picture plane. This flattening of the subject was in keeping with Albers's increasing interest in planarity, which would manifest itself not only in photographic works but also in his celebrated abstract paintings of the following decade.\nMatthew Drutt\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nRobert Delaunay chose the view into the ambulatory of the Parisian Gothic church Saint-Severin as the subject of his first series of paintings, in which he charted the modulations of light streaming through the stained-glass windows and the resulting perceptual distortion of the architecture. The subdued palette and the patches of color that fracture the smooth surface of the floor point to the influence of Paul Cezanne as well as to the stylistic elements of Georges Braque's early Cubist landscapes. Delaunay said that the Saint-Severin theme in his work marked a period of transition from Cezanne to Cubism.\nThe artist's attraction to windows and window views, linked to the Symbolists' use of glass panes as metaphors for the transition from internal to external states, culminated in his Simultaneous Windows series. (The series derives its name from the French scientist Michel-Eugene Chevreul's theory of simultaneous contrasts of color, which explores how divergent hues are perceived at once.) Delaunay stated that these works began his constructive phase, in which he juxtaposed and overlaid translucent contrasting complementary colors to create a synthetic, harmonic composition. Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a poem about these paintings and coined the word Orphism to describe Delaunay's endeavor, which he believed was as independent of descriptive reality as was music (the name derives from Orpheus, the mythological lyre player). Although Simultaneous Windows (2nd Motif, 1st Part) contains a vestigial green profile of the Eiffel Tower, it is one of the artist's last salutes to representation before his leap to complete abstraction.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMondrian was a member of the Dutch De Stijl movement from its inception in 1917. By the early 1920s, in line with De Stijl practice, he restricted his compositions to predominantly off-white grounds divided by black horizontal and vertical lines that often framed subsidiary blocks of individual primary colors. Tableau 2, a representative example of this period, demonstrates the artists rejection of mimesis, which he considered a reprehensibly deceptive imitation of reality.In 1918 Mondrian created his first losangique paintings, such as the later Composition No. 1: Lozenge with Four Lines, by tilting a square canvas 45 degrees. Most of these diamond-shaped works were created in 1925 and 1926 following his break with the De Stijl group over Theo van Doesburgs introduction of the diagonal. Mondrian felt that in so doing van Doesburg had betrayed the movements fundamental principles, thus forfeiting the static immutability achieved through stable verticals and horizontals. Mondrian asserted, however, that his own rotated canvases maintained the desired equilibrium of the grid, while the 45-degree turn allowed for longer lines.Art historian Rosalind Krauss identifies the grid as a structure that has remained emblematic of modernist ambition. She notes in these paintings by Mondrian, whose work has become synonymous with the grid, two signal opposing generative tendencies. Composition No. 1: Lozenge with Four Lines, in which the lines intersect just beyond the picture plane (suggesting that the work is taken from a larger whole), exemplifies a centrifugal disposition of the grid; Tableau 2, whose lines stop short of the pictures edges (implying that it is a self-contained unit), evinces a centripetal tendency. Krauss argues that these dual and conflicting readings of the grid embody the central conflict of Mondriansand indeed of Modernismsambition: to represent properties of materials or perception while also responding to a higher, spiritual call. The grids mythic power, Krauss asserts, is that it makes us able to think we are dealing with materialism (or sometimes science, or logic) while at the same time it provides us with a release into belief (or illusion, or fiction).Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

He eliminated found materials from these compositions and thereby reduced the Dada element of chance they contributed in order to achieve a less idiosyncratic and hence more universal form of expression. This development accorded with his belief in the ascendancy of formal values, which he felt should not be jeopardized by references to anything outside the work of art.When Schwitters returned to the Merz idiom in 1930, he placed more emphasis on the act of painting than he had in his early collages. Though the planes are shaped with the impersonality of geometric contour, they are animated by the variation of rhythmic brushstrokes and the addition of collaged forms. In the tradition of his Merz works of the classic period of 1919 to the mid-1920s, the objects he adopted were disposable articlesthe top of a corroded tin can and a metal butterfly; the picture once included a broken piece of china to the right of the tin circle and two wooden balls below the butterfly. While the objects function as abstract elements within the flat confines of the support, their projection contradicts the two-dimensionality of the picture plane and implies an extension of the work of art into the observers world.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

As a teacher, his influence in this country was enormous and can be detected in the works of a diverse range of artists, including Peter Halley, Donald Judd, and Robert Rauschenberg.\nImpossibles (1931) dates from Albers's years at the Bauhaus and represents his experiments with nontraditional materials and techniques. The mechanical means of producing such glass pieces allowed him to achieve the discipline and detachment that he considered necessary to create nonrepresentational forms. Like other artists of his generation, Albers moved from a figurative style of picture making to geometrically based abstraction. Homage to the Square: Apparition, painted in 1959, is a disarmingly simple work, composed of four superimposed squares of oil color applied with a palette knife directly from the tube onto a white, primed Masonite panel. It is part of a series that Albers began in 1950 and that occupied him for 25 years. The series is defined by an unmitigating adherence to one pictorial formula: the square. The optical effects Albers createdshimmering color contrasts and the illusion of receding and advancing planeswere meant not so much to deceive the eye as to challenge the viewer's faculties of visual reception. This shift in emphasis from perception willed by the artist to reception engineered by the viewer is the philosophical root of the Homage to the Square series. Albers tried to teach the mechanics of vision and show even the uninformed viewer how to see. He was always proud that many nonart students took his classes at Yale. The Homage to the Square series is also distinguished by the carefully recorded inscriptions of technical details on the back of each panel. This codification of the making of the painting, along with the reductively systematic application of colors, anticipated much of the art of the mid-1960s, when painting was stripped of the transcendental, and (in the case of Conceptual art) the paint was often left out altogether.Cornelia Lauf\n",

Beckmann painted the work on an invitation from the German embassy in Paris. A series of sketches shows that he had conceived of the composition as early as 1925. By 1931, when he completed it, accusations and slander against the freethinking artist had begun to mount in Germany, and the somber character of Paris Society seems to reflect his sense of foreboding. Beckmann spent much of his time in Paris, although financial hardship stemming from his persecution led him to give up his studio there one year later. He eventually emigrated to Amsterdam and then to the U.S.Paris Society is rife with ambiguities. The event depicted is a black-tie party, although the socialites gathered there seem strangely depressed. Some of the figures in the composition were identified by the artist's widow, Mathilde Beckmann. They include the central figure, Beckmann's friend Prince Karl Anton Rohan; the Frankfurt banker Albert Hahn, at the far right; the music historian Paul Hirsch, seated at the left; the German ambassador Leopold von Hoesch, at the lower right, with his head in his hands; and possibly Paul Poiret, the French couturier, standing at the left. But why they are together in this scene and what their peculiar postures denote remain a matter of speculation.In cafe, hotel, and beach scenes, Beckmann had proven himself to be a mordant painter of modern life, and some German critics counted him among the artists of the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity). The universalizing tendency of his moral allegories, however, diverged from the political satire of his colleagues, such as Otto Dix and George Grosz. Beckmann's paintings do not succumb to precise interpretation. In spite of their period detail, they seem to represent a condition rather than a historical moment.Cornelia Lauf\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlthough Kandinsky was forced to leave Germany in 1933 due to political pressures, he did not allow the mood of desolation pervading war-torn Europe to enter the paintings and watercolors that he produced in France, where he remained until his death in 1944. His late works are marked by a general lightening of palette and the introduction of organic imagery; breaking away from the rigidity of Bauhaus geometry, he turned to the softer, more malleable shapes used by Paris-based artists associated with Surrealism, such as Jean Arp and Joan Miro. Kandinskys late, often whimsical, paintings were also influenced by the playful, intricately detailed compositions of his longtime friend and Bauhaus colleague Paul Klee.During his first years in France, Kandinsky experimented with pigments mixed with sand, a technical innovation practiced during the 1930s by many Parisian artists, including Andre Masson and Georges Braque. Although Kandinsky utilized this method only until 1936, he created several paintings with rich, textured surfaces such as Accompanied Contrast, in which the interconnected colored planes and smaller floating patterns project slightly from the canvas. Always attentive to and appreciative of contemporary stylistic innovations, Kandinsky inevitably brought his own interests to bear on any aspects he would borrow. As art historian Vivian Barnett has pointed out, his employment of biomorphic formsa motif favored by Surrealist painters as well as by Kleeattests more to his fascination with the organic sciences themselves, particularly embryology, zoology, and botany. During his Bauhaus years, Kandinsky had clipped and mounted illustrations of microscopic organisms, insects, and embryos from scientific journals for pedagogical purposes and study. He also owned several important sourcebooks and encyclopedias from which depictions of minuscule creatures found abstract equivalences in his late paintings. A schematized pink-toned embryo, for instance, floats in the upper-right corner of Dominant Curve, while the figures contained within the green rectangle in the upper-left corner resemble microscopic marine animals. Various Actions is imbued with similar organic figures hovering above a celestial blue field. These buoyant, biomorphic images, often presented in pastel hues, may be read as signs of Kandinskys optimistic vision of a peaceful future and hope for postwar rebirth and regeneration.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

In Voice of Space (of which three other oil versions exist), the bells float in the air; elsewhere they occupy human bodies or replace blossoms on bushes. By distorting the scale, weight, and use of an ordinary object and inserting it into a variety of unaccustomed contexts, Magritte confers on that object a fetishistic intensity. He has written of the jingle bell, a motif that recurs often in his work: I caused the iron bells hanging from the necks of our admirable horses to sprout like dangerous plants at the edge of an abyss.1The disturbing impact of the bells presented in an unfamiliar setting is intensified by the cool academic precision with which they and their environment are painted. The dainty slice of landscape could be the backdrop of an early Renaissance painting, while the bells themselves, in their rotund and glowing monumentality, impart a mysterious resonance.Lucy Flint1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nOne year before Picasso painted the monumental still life Mandolin and Guitar, Cubisms demise was announced during a Dada soiree in Paris by an audience member who shouted that Picasso [was] dead on the field of battle; the evening ended in a riot, which could be quelled only by the arrival of the police. Picassos subsequent series of nine vibrantly colored still lifes (192425), executed in a bold Synthetic Cubist style of overlapping and contiguous forms, discredited such a judgment and asserted the enduring value of the technique. But the artist was not simply resuscitating his previous discoveries in creating this new work; the rounded, organic shapes and saturated hues attest to his appreciation of contemporary developments in Surrealist painting, particularly as evinced in the work of Andre Masson and Joan Miro. The undulating lines, ornamental patterns, and broad chromatic elements of Mandolin and Guitar foretell the emergence of a fully evolved sensual, biomorphic style in Picassos art, which would soon celebrate the presence of his new mistress, Marie-Therese Walter.When Picasso met Marie-Therese on January 11, 1927 in front of Galeries Lafayette in Paris, she was 17 years old. As he was married at the time and she only a teenager, they were compelled to conceal their intense love affair. While their illicit liaison was hidden from public view, its earliest years are documented, albeit covertly, in Picassos work. Five still lifes painted during 1927incorporating the monograms MT and MTP as part of their compositionscryptically announce the entry of Marie-Therese into the artists life. By 1931 explicit references to her fecund, supple body and blond tresses appear in harmonious, voluptuous images such as Woman with Yellow Hair. Marie-Therese became a constant theme; she was portrayed reading, gazing into a mirror, and, most often, sleeping, which for Picasso was the most intimate of depictions.The abbreviated delineation of her profilea continuous, arched line from forehead to nosebecame Picassos emblem for his subject, and appears in numerous sculptures, prints, and paintings of his mistress. Rendered in a sweeping, curvilinear style, this painting of graceful repose is not so much a portrait of Marie-Therese the person as it is Picassos abstract, poetic homage to his young muse.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nFollowing his trip to Africa in 1930, Yves Tanguy produced a group of landscapes that have been termed les coulees (or flowing forms) for their molten character. Other paintings in this sequence include Neither Legends nor Figures, ca. 1930 (Private Collection, United States), and The Armoire of Proteus, 1931 (Private Collection, Paris).1 Perhaps the most striking of the series is Promontory Palace, in which a rigid multitiered mass dominates a broad, flat plain. This corrugated mesa and other buttes in the center foreground stand firm as the surrounding viscous landscape succumbs to some persistent melting force. The small abstract shapes that inhabit the scene are in various stages of metamorphosis: some appear to melt or ooze, others seem to collapse or deflate, and still others secrete or sputter white liquids or gases. Some of these shapes are disturbingly anthropomorphic. A line of globular forms marches down the incline of the promontory to the edge of a cliff, where two forms have already surrendered and begun to melt over the precipice to join the sea of flowing matter below. A five-fingered, bulbous white mass glides over the ground as if on water. Elsewhere steam emerges, both from the pipe-shaped form at the base of the promontory and from the distant horizon. On the highest peak, or the palace, mysterious sparks emanate from a thornlike tower. To the right a hairlike apparition disappears into the thin atmosphere of an empty sky.In the natural world such geologic metamorphosis would require intense heat and volcanic activity. Yet Tanguys restrained grays and muted pinks, accented with cool blue and pale green and yellow, deny the presence of fire and earth. Instead, Tanguy creates a Surrealist terrain where molten and frozen, figurative and abstract, literal and suggestive elements exist in perfect harmony. Tanguys use of a specific horizon line, his naturalistic modeling of forms, and his depiction of landscape evocative of an actual coastline, permit us a conceptual foothold in known experience. Yet our foothold gives way as Tanguys abstract shapes transform known experience into a familiar but irrational fantasy. The power of Tanguys imagery derives from the delicate tension he creates between the logic of sensation and the freedom of imagination.Elizabeth C. Childs1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nBy the time Salvador Dali joined the Surrealist group in 1929, he had formulated his paranoid-critical approach to art, which consisted in conveying his deepest psychological conflicts to the viewer in the hopes of eliciting an empathetic response. He embodied this theoretical approach in a fastidiously detailed painting style. One of his hallucinatory obsessions was the legend of William Tell, which represented for him the archetypal theme of paternal assault.1 The subject occurs frequently in his paintings from 1929, when he entered into a liaison with Gala Eluard, his future wife, against his fathers wishes. Dali felt an acute sense of rejection during the early 1930s because of his fathers attitude toward him.Here father, son, and perhaps mother seem to be fused in the grotesque dream-image of the hermaphroditic creature at center. William Tells apple is replaced by a loaf of bread, with attendant castration symbolism. (Elsewhere Dali uses a lamb chop to suggest his fathers cannibalistic impulses.) Out of the bread arises a lugubrious cloud vision inspired by the imagery of Arnold Bocklin. In one of the recesses of this cloud is an enigmatic inscription in French: Consigne: gacher lardoise totale?Reference to the remote past seems to be made in the two forlorn figures shown in the distant left background, which may convey Dalis memory of the fond communion of father and child. The infinite expanse of landscape recalls Yves Tanguys work of the 1920s. The biomorphic structure dominating the composition suggests at once a violin, the weathered rock formations of Port Lligat on the eastern coast of Spain, the architecture of the Catalan visionary Antoni Gaudi, the sculpture of Jean Arp, a prehistoric monster, and an artists palette. The form has an antecedent in Dalis own work in the gigantic vision of his mother in The Enigma of Desire of 1929. The repressed, guilty desire of the central figure is indicated by its attitude of both protestation and arousal toward the forbidden flower-headed woman (presumably Gala). The shadow darkening the scene is cast by an object outside the picture and may represent the fathers threatening presence, or a more general prescience of doom, the advance of age, or the extinction of life.Lucy Flint\r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAs a founding member of Dada, Jean Arp was among those artists who espoused a rejection of traditional bourgeois values and taste. Arp's response to illusionistic art, which he saw as a bogus reproduction of reality, was to create an abstract art that would ultimately be a truer indication of reality because its generative principles would echo nature's. His method included the expression of chance, informed by the Dadaists' desire for liberation from so-called rationality. For Arp, chance also represented a fundamental law of the organic realm, and his first reliefs, made during the war, are colorful and witty evocations of plant and animal forms on layered wooden panels.In the early 1930s Arp developed the principle of the \"constellation,\" employing it in both his writings and artworks. As applied to poetry, the principle involved using a fixed group of words and focusing on the various ways of combining them, a technique that he compared to \"the inconceivable multiplicity with which nature arranges a flower species in a field.\"1 In making his Constellation reliefs, Arp would first identify a themefor example, five white biomorphic shapes and two smaller black ones on a white groundthen recombine these elements into different configurations. Constellation with Five White Forms and Two Black, Variation III is the last of three versions of this theme. Rather than doggedly copying nature, Arp's variations are poetic evocations of the metamorphosis and change inherent to the cycle of life.While Arp worked on his reliefs through the 1920s and early 1930s he was actively engaged with both Surrealism and the approach to pure abstraction associated with Neo-Plasticism. Membership in these movements was usually mutually exclusive, but Arp's diplomacy enabled him to maintain contact with both. His work, like Joan Miro's, engaged Surrealism at the level of process, for he used automatist strategies to get beyond the constrictions of rational thought. Yet, like Piet Mondrian, he believed in the Neoplatonic goal of representing a higher plane of reality through abstraction.Jennifer Blessing1.

Despite the pose, Woman Walking, like its Egyptian ancestors, conveys no sense of movement. The plane of the body is only slightly inflected by the projections of breasts, belly, and thighs. The long, thin legs are smooth, solid, and columnar. In its flatness, the work evokes the traditions of the highly simplified Cycladic figure and the geometric kouros of archaic Greece. Giacometti is known to have copied works of art at the Louvre, during his travels, and even from reproductions, showing a preference for models characterized by a high degree of stylization. Woman Walking also reflects Giacomettis awareness of twentieth-century sculptors, particularly Constantin Brancusi and Alexander Archipenko.Another plaster version of the sculpture, also probably dating from 1932 (formerly Collection Erica Brausen, London), is distinguished by a triangular cavity in the upper abdomen. The generalization and distortion of form in these works forecast Giacomettis development of the elongated style for which he is best known.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn a group of works made between 1930 and 1933, Alberto Giacometti used the Surrealist techniques of shocking juxtaposition and the distortion and displacement of anatomical parts to express the fears and urges of the subconscious. The aggressiveness with which the human figure is treated in these fantasies of brutal erotic assault graphically conveys the content. The female, seen in horror and longing as both victim and victimizer of male sexuality, is often a crustacean or insectlike form. Woman with Her Throat Cut is a particularly vicious image: the body is splayed open, disemboweled, arched in a paroxysm of sex and death. Eros and Thanatos, seen here as a single theme, are distinguished and treated separately in two preparatory sketches.Body parts are translated into schematic abstract forms like those in Cage of 193031, which includes the spoon shape of the female torso, the rib and backbone motif, and the pod shape of the phallus. Here a vegetal form resembling the pelvic bone terminates one arm, and a phalluslike spindle, the only movable part, gruesomely anchors the other; the womans backbone pins one leg by fusing with it; her slit carotid immobilizes her head. The memory of violence is frozen in the rigidity of rigor mortis. The psychological torment and the sadistic misogyny projected by this sculpture are in startling contrast to the serenity of other contemporaneous pieces by Giacometti, such as Woman Walking.

    "description": "\nDescription\nJean Arp's transition from his painted wooden wall reliefs of the 1920s to his freestanding sculpture of the 1930s occurred about 1930. At this time he executed some freestanding reliefs, which rested either on carved bases or directly on the ground (for example, Shell Profiles [Profils coquilles] of 1930). Biomorphic elements like those attached to the wall reliefs gradually separated into independent forms and assumed positions in fully three dimensional ensembles, such as Bell and Navels (Cloche et nombrils, 1931). When, in 1931, Arp began sculpting wood and modeling plaster in the round, he made figurative torsos. He next embarked on a series of abstract forms called Human Concretions (Concretion humaine, 193336), usually carved in plaster and some later cast in bronze. These sculptures, such as Human Concretion (1934), suggest general processes of growth, crystallization, and metamorphosis, rather than specific motifs drawn from nature. The present sculpture shares the bulbous, protuberant character of the Concretions, its curved and coiled base expressing the spontaneous energy of pullulation. Head and Shell, (Tete et coquille), however, is not one continuous form but two separable elements. A spike attached to the base section supports the upper portion, which may easily be removed. Both conceptually and physically, this work is a unit composed of discrete parts. The object's small size and its partite nature suggest that Arp intended the original plaster version to be handled. During the 1930s, the artist produced several small works made of multiple elements that the viewer could pick up, separate, and rearrange into new configurations. Peggy Guggenheim's fascination with this cast of the plaster original arose from her delight in handling the small sculpture.1Arpvis titles, such as Head and Shell or Metamorphosis: Shell-Swan-Swing (Metamorphose, coquille-cygne-balance-toi), suggest counterparts in nature for his ambiguous organic forms. Such titles should not be considered too literally, however, as they were no doubt inspired by the completed sculptures. As Arp explained his working process, \"Each of these bodies has a definite significance, but it is only when I feel there is nothing more to change that I decide what each means, and it is only then that I give it a name.\"2 Elizabeth C.

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe work of German artist Rudolf Bauer (18891953) forms an integral part of the Guggenheim Museum's Founding Collection. His work had already been introduced and exhibited in the United States by Societe Anonyme co-founder Katherine Dreier in the 1920s, but it was not until Solomon R. Guggenheim became acquainted with his work in the late 1920s through the guidance of Hilla Rebay that it would be collected in any depth.As a young artist in Berlin, where he briefly studied at the Academy of Art, Bauer created satirical illustrations for several German reviews for a living, but he was committed to abstract and nonobjective painting. In Berlin he showed his work in solo and group exhibitions at Herwarth Walden's avant-garde multidisciplinary Galerie Der Sturm together with artists such as Vasily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and Fernand Leger, among others. Bauer taught at Der Sturm, where he met Rebay, with whom he would enter into a long relationship; and he was also the co-founder of such artistic movements as the Novembergruppe and Die Krater as well as the author of several theoretical essays. When Guggenheim began in earnest to acquire works by Kandinsky, Bauer was instrumental in locating significant works for his collection. In 1930, thanks in part to the purchase of his paintings by Guggenheim, Bauer opened his museum gallery Das Geistreich as a private salon where he exhibited his own and Kandinsky's works and which was inspirational for Rebay when she began to formulate her thoughts for a museum for Guggenheim's collection. In 1933 Bauer's work was featured in the Museum of Modern Art in the exhibition Modern European Art and again in 1934 in Modern Works of Art. In 1936 Guggenheim's collection, comprising many of Bauer's works, was publicly exhibited for the first time in Charleston, and in the same year Bauer had a solo exhibition in Chicago. In 1937 his work was included in a group exhibition in Paris as well as in the \"Degenerate Art\" exhibition in Munich. At this time, the Geistreich was compelled to close and Bauer was briefly arrested but was quickly released, thanks to the intervention of Rebay's brother, and left for the United States in August 1939, a few months after the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, the forerunner of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, opened in midtown Manhattan.Bauer was very prolific and his creative output comprised caricatures and satirical drawings of World War I and Weimar Berlin cafe society; cabaret and dance; vivid portraits and expressive female nudes; small but powerful abstract prison drawings; proto-Cubist, Futurist, abstract, and nonobjective prints; watercolors on paper; and large-scale nonobjective paintings. In a nod to Kandinsky and Rebay, his often musically titled works from the 1910s express a lyrical abstraction in an effort to unite painting and music, thus encouraging a spiritual renewal in all areas of art with works of spontaneous invention or impressions of internal and spiritual nature rather than observations of the external material world. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Bauer's work became more geometric and may have been influenced by the modernist and functional rigor of the Bauhaus and Russian Constructivism. Invention (Composition 31) (1933), which was reproduced on the cover of the catalogue of Art of Tomorrow, the opening exhibition of the Museum of Non-Objective Painting on June 1, 1939, culminates into flat geometries tightly gravitating toward a dark center, a hazy black shape maybe symbolizing the ultimate void, harking back to the pure abstract feeling of the Suprematist Russian artist Kasimir Malevich.Karole Vail\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nBy 1925 Max Ernst had developed his frottage (rubbing) technique, which he associated with a childhood memory of accidental forms materializing within the grooves of wooden floorboards. He also acknowledged the influence of his later discovery of Leonardo da Vincis Treatise on Painting, in which artists are advised to gaze at the stains on walls until figures and scenes emerge. In the Hordes series of 192632 Ernst placed twine beneath his canvases and then rubbed pigment over their surfaces. The meanderings of the twine were thus revealed; these chance configurations were then manipulated to elicit imagery. In Zoomorphic Couple, the appearance of light, sinuous channels through dark painted areas produces a relieflike effect suggestive of frottage. However, the artist created the effect here by putting paint-laden string or rope on top of the canvas and spraying over it. The image of the bird, which recurs frequently in Ernsts work from 1925, had become an almost obsessive preoccupation by 1930. In the present painting one can discern a vaguely birdlike form and a caressing humanoid arising from the primordial material that gives them their substance. It has been suggested that the atavistic imagery in Ernsts work of this period alludes to the failure of European civilization in the face of the rising National Socialist threat in Germany.1 (Ernst was blacklisted by the party in 1933 when Hitler became Chancellor of the Third Reich.) Though a sensitivity to the current political climate may be inferred, it is not confirmed by anecdotal detail. The forms have the effect of dream or poetic apparition.The sense of genesis and evolutionary stirrings in Zoomorphic Couple is complemented by the creative inventiveness of the artist, who combines layers of pastel color under spattered, blown, and dripped paint.Lucy Flint1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1920 Antoine Pevsner signed the Realistic Manifesto drafted by his brother Naum Gabo, proclaiming the intention of Constructivism as they conceived it. They sought to translate their apprehension of an absolute and essential reality as the realization of our perceptions of the world in the forms of space and time.1 They believed that space was given form through implications of depth rather than volume, and they rejected mass as the basic sculptural element. Line, rendered dynamic through directionality, established kinetic rhythms. The Constructivists advocated the use of contemporary industrial materials; they did not carve or model these materials according to sculptural conventions, but constructed them according to principles of modern technology. In their words, The plumb-line in our hand, eyes as precise as a ruler, in a spirit as taut as a compass . . . we construct our work as the universe constructs its own, as the engineer constructs his bridges, as the mathematician his formula of the orbits.2In this work Pevsner complicates the delineation of space by using a transparent substance in conjunction with opaque materials. The glass panes echo both the rounded excised outlines of the construction and its angular metal surfaces. The metal ribs anchor the panes of glass and hinge all planes, real and imagined, resulting in a complex structuring of space. Furthermore, they function visually as an Orthodox cross. The icons of Pevsners native Russia, which had played a crucial role in the development of his notions of perspective, may have suggested the form.Lucy Flint1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nBetween 1932 and 1935 Jean Helion created a series of paintings exploring states of visual equilibrium. Among the earliest of these is Equilibrium (Collection Mr. and Mrs. Roy Friedman, Chicago), a simple composition of 1932 in which two curved rectangular shapes are held in balance by two slightly curved lines. In his working journal Helion recorded the following observations about this work: In searching for the effect of space and movement on the elements, that is to say in constructing a work in movement, rather in creating equilibrium out of movement, my images have become more pliant. . . . To establish relations between surfaces as complex as those which are defined by curves, it is necessary to arrange nuances.Following this initial experimentation, Helion composed several variations on the theme of equilibrium. Generally he worked with drawings and oil studies before reaching the formal solutions of his large canvases. His concern in the present work is to establish a balance between the blocky, simple, essentially rectangular mass on the right with the more complex, more colorful, and varied forms on the left. The construction on the left, which is composed of overlapping and interpenetrating curves, bars, and lines, is not continuous. Careful inspection reveals that the unit of four elements in the upper left corner (the red, gray, and black bars and the green shape) does not touch the forms immediately below it. A similarly strategic use of discontinuous forms occurs in other works in the Equilibrium series. In the present painting the subtly disconnected arrangement contributes to the sense of movement and dispersion of the left side of the composition. The multiple hues used at the left also generate visual complexity. The horizontal curves on the left all point to the central white void, which is embraced by the more rigidly horizontal dark blue and light green arms of the stable construction on the right. Vibrant red and orange bars unite the edges of the composition with central forms and bind together right and left halves. A state of visual balance is thus achieved without resorting to the purely rectilinear, often programmatic formulations of the De Stijl artists who had influenced Helion. The Equilibrium series, embodying ideas of suspension and tension of two-dimensional forms, inspired Alexander Calder, who was contemporaneously developing his wind-driven mobiles.1Elizabeth C.

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe kinetic potential of art was of primary interest to Alexander Calder throughout his career: \"Why must art be static? You look at an abstraction, sculptured or painted, an entirely exciting arrangement of planes, spheres, nuclei, entirely without meaning. It would be perfect but it is always still. The next step in sculpture is motion.\"1 Employing the language of abstraction, Calder captured movement through a range of structuresincluding mobiles, stabiles, constellations, towers, and gongsthat offered radical alternatives to the prevailing notions of sculpture and had a profound impact on the history of 20th-century art.\nWhile the extraordinary breadth of Calder's production makes it impossible to characterize his work according to any particular style or technique, he is perhaps best known as the inventor of the mobile. Calder's first mobiles, kinetic works propelled only by air circulating its balanced components, date from the early 1930s, when he lived in Paris. It was Marcel Duchamp who devised the term for these suspended sculptures; as Calder recalled, \"I asked him what sort of a name I could give these things and he at once produced 'mobile.' In addition to something that moves, in French it also means motive.\"\nCalder, a fastidious craftsman, cut, bent, punctured, and twisted his materials entirely by hand, the manual emphasis contributing to the sculptures' evocation of natural form. Shape, size, color, space, and movement combine and recombine in shifting, balanced relationships that provide a visual equivalent to the harmonious but unpredictable activity of nature. In Untitled (ca. 1934), simple wooden shapesmost of them unpaintedare suspended from metal rods. Responding to air currents, the mobile's ever shifting profile moves spontaneously and unpredictably, different elements traveling in different directions at varying rates of speed. Along with a second wood mobile in the Guggenheim Museum's collection, this work was previously owned by renowned collector of Surrealist art Mary Reynolds.\nLucy Flint\n1.

While many of his canvases of the late 1920s and early 1930s clearly relate to works by van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian, whom he met in 1932, Composition demonstrates Helions breakthrough to a more independent style. The painting features a carefully balanced arrangement of flat and curved modular forms rendered with machinelike precision, which appear alternately static and free-floating. The artist further explored this kind of harmonious organization in a series of abstract works he entitled Equilibrium (1933). In 1939, after 10 years of intense devotion to abstract painting, Helion abruptly shifted to figuration for the remainder of his career, continuing his exploration of opposition and recurring motifs through the language of everyday objects. \nMatthew Drutt\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAt the time Bonnard was painting this summer breakfast scene, Rockefeller Center stood half built and Europe was gearing itself for war. Yet the modern world seems all but ignored in Bonnard's painting, which harks back to the artistic tenets of the late 19th century, its vibrant colors conjuring up the canvases and theories of Paul Gauguin's circle. Around 1890, Bonnard belonged to the Nabis (from the Hebrew word for \"prophet\"), a group that tended to paint mystical or occult scenes in order to invoke extraordinary psychic states. As this painting shows, Bonnard still lent a hallucinatory aura to the everyday some 40 years later.Bonnard resolutely painted subjects such as those in Dining Room on the Garden (Grande salle a manger sur le jardin, 193435) for most of his life, being called tres japonard (very Japanese-like) for his attempts to create a charged psychological moment in a virtually non-perspectival domestic space reminiscent of Japanese prints. This painting, one of more than 60 dining-room scenes he made between 1927 and 1947, is neither decorative (as these works have often been called) nor is its subject truly his first concern. Dining Room on the Garden sets out to capture the moment and the intrinsically ungraspable play of mood and light. On close inspection, the colored areas within the flattened picture plane lose their relation to the objects depicted: a chair melds into the window frame; the window echoes the painting's borders, becoming a view within a view; and Marthe, the painter's oft-depicted wife, merges passively into her surroundings. It is in his ability to create a timeless microcosm while laying bare the gesture of applying paint to canvas that Bonnard's modernism is revealed.Cornelia Lauf\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nDuring the 1920s, Fernand Leger was closely allied with Le Corbusier and Amedee Ozenfant, leaders of the Purism movement, which concentrated on the pristine representation of everyday objects. Perhaps as a result of his large-scale mural projects and the cleaner contours of Purist art, the space in Legers paintings became less crowded and the forms grew increasingly flat. By the 1930s, the compositional tensions in Legers earlier work gave way to calmer, freer forms and a greater openness of space. As Leger described it, I placed objects in space so that I could take them as a certainty . . . I selected an object, chucked the table away. I put the object in space, minus perspective.1 The new buoyancy in his work was achieved less through contrast and dissonance than through lyrical rhythms and harmonious shapes. \nAt least five oil versions of Composition with Aloes are known to exist, all dating from 193337. In Composition with Aloes, No. 4 (193435), Leger grouped the elements in a tripartite arrangement against a uniform brown ground. Two crisp vertical bands are surrounded by curvaceous forms, with the animated outline of the aloe plant twisting and swelling on the right. The composition deftly combines the organic and the geometric, the abstract and the representational. The human and the natural spheres gracefully coexist in this work, signaling, by extension, a larger harmony of humankind and nature. \nSuzanne Ramljak\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe 1930s marked a significant turning point in Alexander Calder's career: during this time the focus of his work shifted from figurative wire portraiture and sculpture to more abstract works made of wood and wire, often accentuated with paint. This change was exemplified in a 1931 exhibition at the Galerie Percier in Paris, where wire portraits of friends and personalities were hung at the ceiling, overseeing his newer, often kinetic, abstractions. Untitled (1935) is representative of Calder's floor- and pedestal-based mobiles made in the early 1930s. Here, Calder uses wood, a material that had been absent from his work since the previous decade, in combination with wire and string. Five painted wood orbs, varying in size, are organized in a spatial arrangement of counterbalance and organic movement. Calder later referred to these works as \"Universes.\" For much of the 1930s and like other artists engaged with abstraction after World War I, Calder used cosmic descriptions and scientific terminology: \"I felt that there was no better model for me. . . . Spheres of different sizes, densities, colors, and volumes, floating in space, traversing clouds . . . currents of air, viscosities and odorsof the greatest variety and disparity.\"1 An imagined solar system, the work is an antecedent of Calder's large, independently hanging mobiles, in which finer, less visible wires anchored to the ceiling would replace Untitled's earthbound wooden base, inverted L-shaped support, and restricted movement.Tracey Bashkoff\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlthough Kandinsky was forced to leave Germany in 1933 due to political pressures, he did not allow the mood of desolation pervading war-torn Europe to enter the paintings and watercolors that he produced in France, where he remained until his death in 1944. His late works are marked by a general lightening of palette and the introduction of organic imagery; breaking away from the rigidity of Bauhaus geometry, he turned to the softer, more malleable shapes used by Paris-based artists associated with Surrealism, such as Jean Arp and Joan Miro. Kandinskys late, often whimsical, paintings were also influenced by the playful, intricately detailed compositions of his longtime friend and Bauhaus colleague Paul Klee.During his first years in France, Kandinsky experimented with pigments mixed with sand, a technical innovation practiced during the 1930s by many Parisian artists, including Andre Masson and Georges Braque. Although Kandinsky utilized this method only until 1936, he created several paintings with rich, textured surfaces such as Accompanied Contrast, in which the interconnected colored planes and smaller floating patterns project slightly from the canvas. Always attentive to and appreciative of contemporary stylistic innovations, Kandinsky inevitably brought his own interests to bear on any aspects he would borrow. As art historian Vivian Barnett has pointed out, his employment of biomorphic formsa motif favored by Surrealist painters as well as by Kleeattests more to his fascination with the organic sciences themselves, particularly embryology, zoology, and botany. During his Bauhaus years, Kandinsky had clipped and mounted illustrations of microscopic organisms, insects, and embryos from scientific journals for pedagogical purposes and study. He also owned several important sourcebooks and encyclopedias from which depictions of minuscule creatures found abstract equivalences in his late paintings. A schematized pink-toned embryo, for instance, floats in the upper-right corner of Dominant Curve, while the figures contained within the green rectangle in the upper-left corner resemble microscopic marine animals. Various Actions is imbued with similar organic figures hovering above a celestial blue field. These buoyant, biomorphic images, often presented in pastel hues, may be read as signs of Kandinskys optimistic vision of a peaceful future and hope for postwar rebirth and regeneration.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nVasily Kandinsky's eleven years teaching at the Bauhaus in Dessau, Germany (192233) enabled him to formalize his compositional principles of color and form. The artist often likened the elements in painting to a visual grammar. Believing that this pictorial language was universalwith visual elements evoking emotional associationshe sought a type of communication that could be directly apprehended by all.Green Accent demonstrates Kandinsky's commitment to articulating this visual grammar. Other works such as Red Accent (L'Accent rouge, 1943) or Little Accents (Petits Accents, 1940) underline his interest in visual accents or punctuation marks. Here, the green form functions like an inverted comma or apostrophe, punctuating the central visual statement. Just as punctuation marks may be employed in writing to indicate a sentence's intonation and tenor, so the green element is used in this painting to lighten and relieve the dark mass below; Kandinsky associated the color with rest and peace. A musical analogy is also apt in this instance; Kandinsky frequently compared the effects of color with those of sound and strove to achieve the abstract effects of music in his paintings. The artist believed that color encourages a deeper psychological connection with the artwork, awakening a corresponding physical sensation, which undoubtedly works up the soul.1 According to Kandinsky, color acts directly upon the viewer's psyche in a musical manner: Color is the keyboard, the eyes are the hammers, the soul is the piano with many strings. The artist is the hand which plays, touching one key or another, to cause vibrations in the soul. In this context, the color green can be interpreted as a high note countering the heavy bass note below.Green Accent is evidence of a shift in direction in Kandinsky's later career, when he returned to a combination of angular and biomorphic forms after the strict geometry of his work in the 1920s. The compositional elements in Green Accent are concentrated in a single biomorphic shape floating in the center of the frame. The interior network of architectonic lines contrasts with the curving contours of the dark form and the pronounced brushwork of the white background. Such organic forms appeared frequently in Kandinsky's later works, most likely inspired by French Surrealism and his new interest in the sciences of biology, botany, and zoology. The painting's scratchy, quirky web of white lines also bears comparison to the work of his Bauhaus colleague and friend Paul Klee.Suzanne Ramljak1.

In the two vertical elements at the center of the canvas, the artist uses distinct colors divided along a diagonal axis to communicate a sense of contrast and movement. The effect is further enhanced by the smaller, darker, and diagonally oriented black rectangle at left. The artist appears to have been concerned about the compositional problems posed by his strictly nonobjective style; in 1937, during a lengthy visit to the artist Max Bill in Zurich, he produced a full sheet of sketches with variations on the theme, none of which he ever used for paintings. \nVordemberge-Gildewarts earliest experiments with the unique texture apparent in Composition No. 96 (1935) began in 1933 when he introduced sand into his work. The sand contributes a textural quality in the stippled areas that the artist designated rauh or rough. He would employ this practice only occasionally in later works.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe development of the bird theme in Constantin Brancusi's oeuvre can be traced from its appearance in the Maiastra sculptures (191018) through the Golden Bird (L'Oiseau d'or, 1919) group and, finally, to the Bird in Space series. Sixteen examples of the Bird in Space (L'Oiseau dans l'espace, 192340) sequence, dating from 1923 to 1940, have been identified. The streamlined form of the present Bird in Space (19321940), stripped of individualizing features, communicates the notion of flight itself rather than describing the appearance of a particular bird. A vestige of the open beak of the Maiastra is retained in the beveled top of the tapering form, a slanted edge accelerating the upward movement of the whole.This sculpture, closely related to a marble version completed in 1931, could have been cast as early as 1932 and finished in 1940. Though the shaft of the first Bird in Space was mounted on a discrete conical support, the support of the present example is incorporated as an organically irregular stem, providing an earthbound anchor for the sleek, soaring form.As was customary in Brancusi's work, the brass is smoothed and polished to the point where the materiality of the sculpture is dissolved in its reflective luminosity. Brancusi's spiritual aspirations, his longing for transcendence of the material world and its constraints, are verbalized in his description of Bird in Space as a \"project before being enlarged to fill the vault of the sky.\"1Lucy Flint1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlthough Kandinsky was forced to leave Germany in 1933 due to political pressures, he did not allow the mood of desolation pervading war-torn Europe to enter the paintings and watercolors that he produced in France, where he remained until his death in 1944. His late works are marked by a general lightening of palette and the introduction of organic imagery; breaking away from the rigidity of Bauhaus geometry, he turned to the softer, more malleable shapes used by Paris-based artists associated with Surrealism, such as Jean Arp and Joan Miro. Kandinskys late, often whimsical, paintings were also influenced by the playful, intricately detailed compositions of his longtime friend and Bauhaus colleague Paul Klee.During his first years in France, Kandinsky experimented with pigments mixed with sand, a technical innovation practiced during the 1930s by many Parisian artists, including Andre Masson and Georges Braque. Although Kandinsky utilized this method only until 1936, he created several paintings with rich, textured surfaces such as Accompanied Contrast, in which the interconnected colored planes and smaller floating patterns project slightly from the canvas. Always attentive to and appreciative of contemporary stylistic innovations, Kandinsky inevitably brought his own interests to bear on any aspects he would borrow. As art historian Vivian Barnett has pointed out, his employment of biomorphic formsa motif favored by Surrealist painters as well as by Kleeattests more to his fascination with the organic sciences themselves, particularly embryology, zoology, and botany. During his Bauhaus years, Kandinsky had clipped and mounted illustrations of microscopic organisms, insects, and embryos from scientific journals for pedagogical purposes and study. He also owned several important sourcebooks and encyclopedias from which depictions of minuscule creatures found abstract equivalences in his late paintings. A schematized pink-toned embryo, for instance, floats in the upper-right corner of Dominant Curve, while the figures contained within the green rectangle in the upper-left corner resemble microscopic marine animals. Various Actions is imbued with similar organic figures hovering above a celestial blue field. These buoyant, biomorphic images, often presented in pastel hues, may be read as signs of Kandinskys optimistic vision of a peaceful future and hope for postwar rebirth and regeneration.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAn assiduous student of music, nature, mathematics, and science, Klee applied this constellation of interests to his art at every turn. Even his purely abstract works have their own particular subject matter. In the Current Six Thresholds, an austere composition of horizontal chromatic stripes divided into smaller units and intersected by vertical bands, has been compared to landscape painting. A late Bauhaus work, it is part of a series of gridlike canvases that Klee painted after he returned from a trip to Egypt. His visual impressions of the Nile river valley are represented here through a highly schematized, geometric analogy composed of a square lattice motif and restrained tonal variations. Another geometric painting, New Harmony, demonstrates the artists long-standing interest in color theory. Such flat configurations of painted rectangles appeared in Klees work as early as 1915 and evolved as expressions of his equation of chromatic division with musical notation. This late canvas, painted in 1936, is the last such composition and, in typical Klee fashion, looks toward the new and innovative, rather than nostalgically backward. According to art historian Andrew Kagan, the composition is based on the principle of bilateral inverted symmetry (the right side of the canvas is an upside-down reflection of the left) and the tonal distribution of juxtaposed, noncomplementary colors evokes the nonthematic, monodic 12-tone music of Arnold Schonberg. Kagan notes, in conjunction with this reading, that Klee used 12 hues in New Harmony, save for the neutral gray and the black underpainting.Klee revealed a more socially and politically relevant side in his 1937 painting Revolution of the Viaduct, of which the Guggenheims Arches of the Bridge Break Ranks is an earlier version. Created when Fascism was on the rise in Europe, the image of rebellious arches escaping from the conformity of a viaduct invokes public dissension while promoting individuality. It is a flippant but foreboding reference to Albert Speers monolithic Nazi architecture as well as to official Soviet imagery of workers marching forward in unison. There is a poignant postscript to Klees social critique: after the artist fled Germany in 1937 to his native Switzerland, 17 of his works were displayed in the Nazis Degenerate Art exhibition, a show of Modern painting and sculpture that they considered too free-spirited and libertarian.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nLike his compatriot Rene Magritte, Paul Delvaux applied a fastidious, detailed technique to scenes deriving their impact from unsettling incongruities of subject. Influenced by Giorgio de Chirico, he frequently included classicizing details and used perspectival distortion to create rapid, plunging movement from foreground to deep background. Unique to Delvaux is the silent, introspective cast of figures he developed during the mid-1930s. His formidable, buxom, nude or seminude women pose immobile with unfocused gazes, their arms frozen in rhetorical gestures, dominating a world through which men, preoccupied and timid, unobtrusively make their way.Although the fusion of woman and tree in the present picture invites comparison with Greek mythological subjects, the artist has insisted that no such references were intended. The motif of the mirror appears in 1936 in works such as Woman in a Grotto (Collection Thyssen-Bornemisza, Lugano) and The Mirror (formerly Collection Roland Penrose, London; destroyed during World War II). In The Break of Day a new element is introduced; the reflected figure is not present within the scene, but exists outside the canvas field. She is, therefore, in some sense, the viewer, even if that viewer should happen to be male. The irony of the circumstance in which a clothed male viewer could see himself reflected as a nude female torso would have particularly appealed to Marcel Duchamp, who appropriated the detail of the mirror in his collage of 1942 In the Manner of Delvaux (Collection Vera and Arturo Schwarz, Milan).Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nDuring the early months of 1937 Pablo Picasso was responding powerfully to the Spanish Civil War with the preparatory drawings for Guernica and with etchings such as The Dream and Lie of Franco, an example of which is in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. However, in this period he also executed a group of works that do not betray this preoccupation with political events. The subject of On the Beach, also known as Girls with a Toy Boat, specifically recalls Picassos Three Bathers of 1920. Painted at Le Tremblay-sur-Mauldre near Versailles, On the Beach is one of several paintings in which he returns to the ossified, volumetric forms in beach environments that appeared in his works of the late 1920s and early 1930s. On the Beach can be compared with Henri Matisses Le Luxe, II, ca. 190708, in its simplified, planar style and in the poses of the foreground figures. It is plausible that the arcadian themes of his friendly rival Matisse would appeal to Picasso as an alternative to the violent images of war he was conceiving at the time.At least two preparatory drawings have been identified for this work. In one (Collection Musee Picasso, Paris), the male figure looming on the horizon has a sinister appearance. In the other drawing (present whereabouts unknown),1 as in the finished version, his mien is softened and neutralized to correspond with the features of the two female figures. The sense of impotent voyeurism conveyed as he gazes at the fertile, exaggeratedly sexual girls calls to mind the myth of Diana caught unaware at her bath.Lucy Flint1.

The latter is a lyrical hymn to joie de vivre, and in retrospect derives a particular poignancy for having been painted just a few months before the outbreak of World War II. With its ample geometry and resonant colors, the earlier still life is more imposing. The table and the objects on it are presented as if they are surging forward on the crest of a wave. The effect is in part due to the daringly simple background, divided into two halves of slightly different browns, against which the vividly colored table and objects appear to float. This evocation of a space dynamically moving forward is not arrived at by any kind of calculated perspectival construction but depends on the interaction of all the colors and forms of the painting. The conjunction of the two brown walls clearly dictates the color shifts that occur in the two nearly symmetrical halves of the image and sets the objects into sharp relief; at the same time, it creates the illusion of separating the fruit dish and the pitcher, an isolating effect that is in full accord with the Spanish still-life tradition.\n",

His compositions, arrived at in an unpremeditated manner directly on the canvas, recall the landscape of Locronan, in the French province of Brittany, where he spent childhood summers at a house owned by his parents. The repertory of memory was augmented by his experience of Africa during a trip of the early 1930s. After this the light in his paintings became clear and strong and the color schemes more complex. Vegetal forms were replaced by mineral formations. Dolmens and menhirs, stone remnants of prehistoric ages, and fossilized bones were smoothed and tinted in the dream spaces of his canvases. The assertive shadows cast in these landscapes recall those of Giorgio de Chirico, whose example had inspired Tanguy to take up painting in 1923.The spatial paradox of The Sun in Its Jewel Case depends on the merging of sky and earth, achieved through the continuous gradation of color over the surfacethere is no horizon lineand the device of a diagonal line of forms shown receding in perspective from lower right to upper left. Acute angles are suggested throughout, by the placement of objects, by the relationship of shadows to objects, or by the things themselves. Geometric precision and a minutely detailed academic technique, in which careful modeling lends plastic solidity to form, heighten the poetic strangeness of Tanguys world.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nJoseph Cornell lived an isolated life with his mother at their home in Flushing, New York, from which he made frequent excursions into Manhattan to gather objects for his constructions. His diaries record his alternating feelings of being trapped at home, and then of release when he escaped to Manhattan. Working on his boxes at home in his cellar became a substitute for traveling, the arrangement of imaginary souvenirs inducing the excitement of voyages.Fortune Telling Parrot offers many associations with exotic travels. First, the box construction itself resembles the apparatus of a hurdy-gurdy, invoking the bohemian world of the traveling gypsy musician. The crank on the right exterior of the construction turns a broken music box, hidden in the lower-right corner of the sculpture. The music box in turn is attached by a thin rod to the cylinder above it, which is intended to revolve while music plays.The cylinder is covered with decorations, some of which suggest the paraphernalia and practices of the fortune-teller: playing cards such as the King of Hearts and the Jack of Clubs; the numbers one through nine; a picture of two hands playing cats cradle, recalling the entertainments of the gypsy; and the picture of a gypsy woman in elaborate costume. Small stars on the cylinder and a map of the constellation of Ursa Minor, Little Bear, in the lower-left corner of the box, also allude to astrology and divination. The parrot itself is a common attribute of the itinerant fortune-teller. Facing the revolving canister, this bird assumes the role of a soothsayers assistant. Exotic birds, including parrots, parakeets, and cockatoos, appear in some eighteen boxes by Cornell, the present example being the earliest and the others dating from the forties and fifties. In other boxes, birds are caged and chained on their perches, captured as exotic pets. Cornell recalls in his diary some of the experiences that contributed to his obsession with parrots: magic windows of yesterday . . . pet shop windows splashed with white tropical plumage / the kind of revelation symptomatic of city wanderings in another era. . . . scintillating songs of Rossini and Bellini and the whole golden age of the bel canto . . . indelible childhood memory of an old German woman a neighbors pet parrot may have added to the obsession of these . . . feathered friends.1Elizabeth C.

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe monumental oak King of Kings (Le roi des rois, 1938) was originally intended to stand in Brancusi's Temple of Meditation, a private sanctuary commissioned in 1933 by the Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar of Indore. Although never realized, the templeconceived as a windowless chamber (save for a ceiling aperture) with interior reflecting pool, frescoes of birds, and an underground entrancewould have embodied the concerns most essential to Brancusi's art: the idealization of aesthetic form; the integration of architecture, sculpture, and furniture; and the poetic evocation of spiritual thought.Wood elicited from Brancusi a tendency toward Expressionism, resulting in unique carved objects. While his sculptures executed in stone or metal represent archetypal forms, such as birds in flight and sleeping figures, individual works in wood suggest specific characters or spiritual entities. For example, King of Kings may be interpreted as Brancusi's attempt to translate the power of Eastern religion into sculptural form. The work's original title was Spirit of Buddha (L'esprit du Bouddha), and Brancusi is known to have been familiar with Buddhism through the writings of the Tibetan philosopher Milarepa.Although the extent to which Brancusi's work was inspired by African sculpture and Romanian folk carvings has been widely debated among scholars, it is clear that he was acutely responsive to \"primitivizing\" influences early in his career. Paul Gauguin's technique of direct carving to emulate the raw quality of indigenous Tahitian art inspired Brancusi to experiment with more daring approaches to sculpture than his academic training had previously allowed. Gauguin's aesthetic most likely prompted Brancusi to study tribal art, evident in the serrated patterns typical of African carvings on the bottom portion of Adam and Eve (Adam et Eve, 1921) as well as on the sides of King of Kings. The overt sexual references in the former work may also have been inspired by so-called primitive fetishes.Sculptural sources from Brancusi's native country are also abundant: prototypes for the sequential designs of King of Kings have been found in Romanian vernacular architecture such as wooden gate posts and chiseled ornamental pillars. The Sorceress (La sorciere, 191624), pictured with Watchdog (Chien de garde, 1916), has been interpreted as the flying witch described in Romanian peasant tales. Brancusi never clarified the visual sources for his designs, preferring instead to promote an air of mystery surrounding the origins of his vision.Nancy Spector\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nFrom 1938 to 1940 Piet Mondrian, who had fled wartime Paris, was established in London near his friends Naum Gabo, Barbara Hepworth, and Ben Nicholson. During this period he continued working in the highly reductivist Neo-Plastic mode he had developed in France, in which horizontal and vertical black lines intersect on the canvas in asymmetrically balanced relationships to yield flat white or colored quadrilaterals. The palette is generally restricted to black, white, and primary colors. The present work is among the more coloristically austere examples.By divorcing form completely from its referential meaning, Mondrian hoped to provide a visual equivalent for the truths that inhabit nature but are concealed in its random, flawed manifestations. He felt that if he could communicate these truths by means of a system of resolved oppositions, a real equation of the universal and the individual,1 the spiritual effect on the viewer would be one of total repose and animistic harmony. In order to effect this transmission the artist must sublimate his personality so that it does not interfere with the viewers perception of the rhythmic equilibrium of line, dimension, and color. These elements, however, are organized not according to the impersonal dictates of mathematics but rather to the intuition of the artist. Likewise, although the artists gesture is minimized and the reference to personal experience erased, his presence can be detected in the stroke of the paintbrush and the unevenness of the edge of the transcendent line. The individual consciousness exists in a dialectical relationship with the absolute, which is realized pictorially through, in Mondrians words, the mutual interaction of constructive elements and their inherent relations.2 Just as the forms and space of the canvas are abstracted from life, so the spiritual plane is removed from, though related to, the work of art. Mondrian sought to unite art, matter, and spirit to discover in all aspects of experience the universal harmony posited in Neo-Plasticism.Lucy Flint1. Quoted in Theories of Modern Art, ed. H. B.

    "description": "\nDescription\nDuring the late 1930s Julio Gonzalez worked simultaneously in naturalistic and abstract idioms. His abstract mode constituted an important contribution to the development of avant-garde sculpture in both Europe and the United States. This mode is exemplified by Monsieur Cactus of 1939, in which he returns to the metamorphic theme of several earlier sculptures. As in works by other Spanish artists living abroad during the Civil War, the figure is anguishedsee, for example, Joan Miros Seated Woman II or Pablo Picassos Guernica of 1937. Indeed, several of the more literal preparatory drawings for the sculpture, dating from December of 1938, suggest that the figure is shrieking; the prickly nails intensify the aggressive effect of the work, recalling Picassos use of nails in his Guitar of 1926. Though the distortion and dislocation of anatomical features make positive identification difficult, with the aid of the drawings one can read a raised arm joined to the hip, its five fingers spread like a cluster of cylindrical cactus stems. The analogous five-fingered block to the left of the torso seems to be lowered to a position just above an angular phallus.The companion to this sculpture, known as Cactus Man II or Madame Cactus, has been interpreted as the image of the Spanish peasants defiance of Francos fascist threat.1 While the synthesis of human being and cactus may reflect the identification of the Spanish peasant with the land, the metamorphic figure may more generally personify the republican cause. At the end of 1938 Franco launched a major offensive against Catalonia, Gonzalezs native province, and was to take its capital, Barcelona, in January of 1939, signaling the end of republican hopes. By the time the drawings for the second cactus sculpture appeared in the summer of 1939, Madrid had fallen and Francos Falange was in full power.Lucy Flint1. E. A.

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe expressionistic Seated Woman II can be seen as a final manifestation of Joan Miros peintures sauvages, works characterized by violence of execution and imagery. It was painted at a time when Miro, like Pablo Picasso and Julio Gonzalez, was responding acutely to the events of the Spanish Civil War.The human figure has been transmogrified here into a grotesque and bestial creature. However, the aggressiveness of imagery and formal elements coexists with fanciful details and cosmic implications. Though the open, saw-toothed mouth imparts a sense of the womans voraciousness or anguish, her bottle-breast implies her generative force. Her expansive torso constitutes an impenetrable ground, its horizon line described by her squared shoulders, out of which grow the vegetative stems of arms and neck. The bird and fish forms floating through the atmosphere become insignias for air and water, while the moon, star, and planet emblems on the womans collar broaden the associations to encompass the astral plane. The remaining abstract shapes seem to course slowly in mysterious orbits, passing through and beyond one another, changing color where they intersect. A cohesive universe is created despite the dichotomies of light and dark, nurture and destruction, life and nonexistence. Integration is provided by the repetition of shapes, such as the leaf and oval, which suggests analogies: the womans pendant becomes a moon or vagina, her hair resembles lines of sight, like those of the fish, or rays of light, and her teeth are equated with the decorative motifs or mountains in the miniature landscape of her collar.This work postdates by about two months the more generalized Seated Woman I (Collection The Museum of Modern Art, New York).Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

The latter is a lyrical hymn to joie de vivre, and in retrospect derives a particular poignancy for having been painted just a few months before the outbreak of World War II. With its ample geometry and resonant colors, the earlier still life is more imposing. The table and the objects on it are presented as if they are surging forward on the crest of a wave. The effect is in part due to the daringly simple background, divided into two halves of slightly different browns, against which the vividly colored table and objects appear to float. This evocation of a space dynamically moving forward is not arrived at by any kind of calculated perspectival construction but depends on the interaction of all the colors and forms of the painting. The conjunction of the two brown walls clearly dictates the color shifts that occur in the two nearly symmetrical halves of the image and sets the objects into sharp relief; at the same time, it creates the illusion of separating the fruit dish and the pitcher, an isolating effect that is in full accord with the Spanish still-life tradition.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe development of the bird theme in Constantin Brancusi's oeuvre can be traced from its appearance in the Maiastra sculptures (191018) through the Golden Bird (L'Oiseau d'or, 1919) group and, finally, to the Bird in Space series. Sixteen examples of the Bird in Space (L'Oiseau dans l'espace, 192340) sequence, dating from 1923 to 1940, have been identified. The streamlined form of the present Bird in Space (19321940), stripped of individualizing features, communicates the notion of flight itself rather than describing the appearance of a particular bird. A vestige of the open beak of the Maiastra is retained in the beveled top of the tapering form, a slanted edge accelerating the upward movement of the whole.This sculpture, closely related to a marble version completed in 1931, could have been cast as early as 1932 and finished in 1940. Though the shaft of the first Bird in Space was mounted on a discrete conical support, the support of the present example is incorporated as an organically irregular stem, providing an earthbound anchor for the sleek, soaring form.As was customary in Brancusi's work, the brass is smoothed and polished to the point where the materiality of the sculpture is dissolved in its reflective luminosity. Brancusi's spiritual aspirations, his longing for transcendence of the material world and its constraints, are verbalized in his description of Bird in Space as a \"project before being enlarged to fill the vault of the sky.\"1Lucy Flint1. Quoted in Sidney Geist, Brancusi: A Study of the Sculpture (New York: Grossman, 1968), pp. 11314.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe monumental oak King of Kings (Le roi des rois, 1938) was originally intended to stand in Brancusi's Temple of Meditation, a private sanctuary commissioned in 1933 by the Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar of Indore. Although never realized, the templeconceived as a windowless chamber (save for a ceiling aperture) with interior reflecting pool, frescoes of birds, and an underground entrancewould have embodied the concerns most essential to Brancusi's art: the idealization of aesthetic form; the integration of architecture, sculpture, and furniture; and the poetic evocation of spiritual thought.Wood elicited from Brancusi a tendency toward Expressionism, resulting in unique carved objects. While his sculptures executed in stone or metal represent archetypal forms, such as birds in flight and sleeping figures, individual works in wood suggest specific characters or spiritual entities. For example, King of Kings may be interpreted as Brancusi's attempt to translate the power of Eastern religion into sculptural form. The work's original title was Spirit of Buddha (L'esprit du Bouddha), and Brancusi is known to have been familiar with Buddhism through the writings of the Tibetan philosopher Milarepa.Although the extent to which Brancusi's work was inspired by African sculpture and Romanian folk carvings has been widely debated among scholars, it is clear that he was acutely responsive to \"primitivizing\" influences early in his career. Paul Gauguin's technique of direct carving to emulate the raw quality of indigenous Tahitian art inspired Brancusi to experiment with more daring approaches to sculpture than his academic training had previously allowed. Gauguin's aesthetic most likely prompted Brancusi to study tribal art, evident in the serrated patterns typical of African carvings on the bottom portion of Adam and Eve (Adam et Eve, 1921) as well as on the sides of King of Kings. The overt sexual references in the former work may also have been inspired by so-called primitive fetishes.Sculptural sources from Brancusi's native country are also abundant: prototypes for the sequential designs of King of Kings have been found in Romanian vernacular architecture such as wooden gate posts and chiseled ornamental pillars. The Sorceress (La sorciere, 191624), pictured with Watchdog (Chien de garde, 1916), has been interpreted as the flying witch described in Romanian peasant tales. Brancusi never clarified the visual sources for his designs, preferring instead to promote an air of mystery surrounding the origins of his vision.Nancy Spector\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAttirement of the Bride is an example of Max Ernsts veristic or illusionistic Surrealism, in which a traditional technique is applied to an incongruous or unsettling subject. The theatrical, evocative scene has roots in late nineteenth-century Symbolist painting, especially that of Gustave Moreau. It also echoes the settings and motifs of sixteenth-century German art. The willowy, swollen-bellied figure types recall those of Lucas Cranach the Elder in particular. The architectural backdrop with its strong contrast of light and shadow and its inconsistent perspective shows the additional influence of Giorgio de Chirico, whose work had overwhelmed Ernst when he first saw it in 1919.The pageantry and elegance of the image are contrasted with its primitivizing aspectsthe garish colors, the animal and monster formsand the blunt phallic Symbolism of the poised spearhead. The central scene is contrasted as well with its counterpart in the picture-within-a-picture at the upper left. In this detail the bride appears in the same pose, striding through a landscape of overgrown classical ruins. Here Ernst has used the technique of decalcomania invented in 1935 by Oscar Dominguez, in which diluted paint is pressed onto a surface with an object that distributes it unevenly, such as a pane of glass. A suggestive textured pattern results.The title of this work had occurred to Ernst at least as early as 1936, when he italicized it in a text in his book Beyond Painting. Ernst had long identified himself with the bird, and had invented an alter ego, Loplop, Superior of the Birds, in 1929. Thus one may perhaps interpret the bird-man at the left as a depiction of the artist; the bride may in some sense represent the young English Surrealist artist Leonora Carrington.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nDuring the early 1930s Alexander Calder, a pioneering figure in the development of kinetic art, created sculptures in which balanced components move, some driven by motor and others impelled by the action of air currents. Marcel Duchamp first applied the descriptive designation mobiles to those reliant on air alone. Either suspended or freestanding, these constructions generally consist of flat pieces of painted metal connected by wire veins and stems. Their biomorphic shapes recall the organic motifs of the Surrealist painting and sculpture of his friends Joan Miro and Jean Arp. Calder, a fastidious craftsman, cut, bent, punctured, and twisted his materials entirely by hand, the manual emphasis contributing to the sculptures evocation of natural form. Shape, size, color, space, and movement combine and recombine in shifting, balanced relationships that provide a visual equivalent to the harmonious but unpredictable activity of nature.The present mobile is organized as an antigravitational cascade, in which large, heavy, mature shapes sway serenely at the top, while small, undifferentiated, agitated, new growth dips and rocks below. Calder left one leaf unpainted, revealing the aluminum surface and underscoring the sense of variety he considered vital to the success of a work of art. As he wrote: Disparity in form, color, size, weight, motion, is what makes a composition. . . . It is the apparent accident to regularity which the artist actually controls by which he makes or mars a work.1Lucy Flint1. Quoted in Jean Lipman, Calders Universe, exh. cat.

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlthough Kandinsky was forced to leave Germany in 1933 due to political pressures, he did not allow the mood of desolation pervading war-torn Europe to enter the paintings and watercolors that he produced in France, where he remained until his death in 1944. His late works are marked by a general lightening of palette and the introduction of organic imagery; breaking away from the rigidity of Bauhaus geometry, he turned to the softer, more malleable shapes used by Paris-based artists associated with Surrealism, such as Jean Arp and Joan Miro. Kandinskys late, often whimsical, paintings were also influenced by the playful, intricately detailed compositions of his longtime friend and Bauhaus colleague Paul Klee.During his first years in France, Kandinsky experimented with pigments mixed with sand, a technical innovation practiced during the 1930s by many Parisian artists, including Andre Masson and Georges Braque. Although Kandinsky utilized this method only until 1936, he created several paintings with rich, textured surfaces such as Accompanied Contrast, in which the interconnected colored planes and smaller floating patterns project slightly from the canvas. Always attentive to and appreciative of contemporary stylistic innovations, Kandinsky inevitably brought his own interests to bear on any aspects he would borrow. As art historian Vivian Barnett has pointed out, his employment of biomorphic formsa motif favored by Surrealist painters as well as by Kleeattests more to his fascination with the organic sciences themselves, particularly embryology, zoology, and botany. During his Bauhaus years, Kandinsky had clipped and mounted illustrations of microscopic organisms, insects, and embryos from scientific journals for pedagogical purposes and study. He also owned several important sourcebooks and encyclopedias from which depictions of minuscule creatures found abstract equivalences in his late paintings. A schematized pink-toned embryo, for instance, floats in the upper-right corner of Dominant Curve, while the figures contained within the green rectangle in the upper-left corner resemble microscopic marine animals. Various Actions is imbued with similar organic figures hovering above a celestial blue field. These buoyant, biomorphic images, often presented in pastel hues, may be read as signs of Kandinskys optimistic vision of a peaceful future and hope for postwar rebirth and regeneration.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nSchooled as an architect in his native Santiago, Chile, Matta went to Paris in 1933 to work for the famed modernist architect Le Corbusier. By the mid-1930s, Matta had become friendly with members of the Surrealist circle, and in 1937, influenced by both Surrealist techniques, including automatism, and his architectural training, he left Le Corbusiers atelier to focus on art. In 1939, Matta fled Europe for New York, where he maintained contact with Surrealist colleagues who also sought refuge in the United States during World War II. In addition, he forged new relationships with many of his contemporaries in the nascent New York Schoolamong them, William Baziotes, Arshile Gorky, Robert Motherwell, and Jackson Pollockand he introduced them to Surrealism firsthand.While his paintings were sometimes nonobjective, Matta often depicted landscapes conjured from the unconscious that resemble cosmic locales like those popularized by science fiction. He used the terms inscapes and psychological morphologies to describe these works, which he considered to be maps of the mind or spaces that exist beyond human perception. He developed a technique that involved the use of rags, sponges, and brushes to build up layers of pigment, which he would rub away in various places, thereby uncovering new forms. The physical transformation brought on by this process alluded to the concepts of change and metamorphosis, which are fundamental to his art.Matta continued to develop this approach in paintings of the 1940s such as Years of Fear (1941), which explored the timely topics of anxiety and destruction. Its abstract, allover composition lacks traditional indications of spatial orientation such as a horizon line, yet it still reads as a landscape. The swirling, dark cloud in the upper right corner is formally suggestive of such cataclysmic events as a volcanic eruption, war or apocalypse, themes that reflected the devastating events unfolding in Europe at that time. He contrasted this expressive aspect of the work with a more rational one, manifest in areas of pure color demarcated by lines and rendered in a more soothing palette of blues, grays, and yellows. The formal tension between logic and emotion parallels the implied struggle on the interior, psychic battlefield to conquer both personal fears and the terror brought on by World War II.Valerie Hillings\n",

The same year he executed a small oil on cardboard (now in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection) that became the basis for the large-scale The Antipope. When Guggenheim saw the small version, she interpreted a dainty horse-human figure on the right as Ernst, who was being fondled by a woman she identified as herself. She wrote that Ernst conceded that a third figure, depicted in a three-quarter rear view, was her daughter Pegeen; she did not attempt to identify another horse-headed female to the left.1 When Ernst undertook the large version from December to March he changed the body of the Peggy figure into a greenish column and transferred her amorous gesture to a new character, who wears a pink tunic and is depicted in a relatively naturalistic way. The Pegeen figure in the center appears to have two faces, one of a flayed horse that looks at the horse-woman at the left. The other, with only its cheek and jaw visible, gazes in the opposite direction, out over the grim lagoon, like a pensive subject conceived by Caspar David Friedrich.The great upheavals in Ernsts personal life during this period encourage such a biographical interpretation. Despite his marriage to Guggenheim, he was deeply involved with Leonora Carrington at this time, and spent hours riding horses with her. As birds were an obsession for Ernst, so horses were for Carrington. Her identification with them is suggested throughout her collection of stories La Dame ovale, published in 1939 with seven illustrations by Ernst, two of which include metamorphosed horse creatures. It seems plausible that the alienated horse-woman of The Antipope, who twists furtively to watch the other horse-figure, represents a vision of Guggenheim. Like the triumphal bride in Attirement of the Bride, she wears an owl headgear. Her irreconcilable separation from her companion is expressed graphically by the device of the diagonally positioned spear that bisects the canvas. The features of the green totemic figure resemble those of Carrington, whose relationship with Ernst was to end soon after the painting was completed, when she moved to Mexico with her husband.Lucy Flint1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn contrast to the cluttered assemblage of juxtaposed objects of varying scales in other boxes, Joseph Cornell here creates a coherent miniaturized world. A black painted border on the surface of the glass frames a white palace and serves as a proscenium that invokes the world of theater and spectacle. The title Setting for a Fairy Tale enhances the stage-model associations of the construction. Cornells setting is a reproduction of Jacques Androuet du Cerceaus engraving, first published in 1576, of the Chateau de Madrid in Paris. Reproductions of this same engraving appear in at least nine of his palace constructions, for example, Untitled (Pink Palace) of ca. 194648. The Peggy Guggenheim work is the first of these boxes, which were created between 1942 and the mid-1950s.For Cornell, fairy tales had specific associations with the romantic ballet. His favorite ballets included classics such as Swan Lake, The Nutcracker, Ondine, and, of special relevance to the present discussion, Sleeping Beauty. Cornells friend Tamara Toumanova, whom he met in 1940, often performed the role of the Princess Aurora in Sergei Diaghilevs revival of the ballet Sleeping Beauty by Marius Petipa, with music by Pyotr Ilich Tchaikovsky.1 About 1941 the artist made several objects resembling glass Christmas ornaments that contained cutout pictures of Toumanova dancing Aurora. Certain details of Setting for a Fairy Tale, such as the bramble of twigs suggesting a dense forest around the palace, may derive from the Sleeping Beauty story. Both the balletic rendition of the fairy tale and Cornells shadow box conjure up fantasies of romantic love and historic pageantry.In other constructions Cornell invites the viewers imaginative participation in the work through means such as a hatch that may be opened or a tempting crank of a hurdy-gurdy that may be turned. In the present construction the imagined participation is not physical, but psychological and creative. The viewer may be playwright, choreographer, director, and performer in the spectacle of his choice. In a careful scrutiny of the work the mirrored surfaces not only offer the illusion of shimmering glass windows, but also engage the viewer in a multifaceted reflection and discovery of oneself.Elizabeth C.

    "description": "\nDescription\nLike other members of the New York School, Jackson Pollock was influenced in his early work by Joan Miro and Pablo Picasso, and seized on the Surrealists concept of the unconscious as the source of art. In the late 1930s Pollock introduced imagery based on totemic or mythic figures, ideographic signs, and ritualistic events, which have been interpreted as pertaining to the buried experiences and cultural memories of the psyche.The Moon Woman suggests the example of Picasso, particularly his Girl Before a Mirror of 1932. The palettes are similar, and both artists describe a solitary standing female as if she had been x-rayed, her backbone a broad black line from which her curving contours originate. Frontal and profile views of the face are combined to contrast two aspects of the self, one serene and public, the other dark and interior.The subject of the moon woman, which Pollock treated in several drawings and paintings of the early 1940s, could have been available to him from various sources. At this time many artists, among them Pollocks friends William Baziotes and Robert Motherwell, were influenced by the fugitive, hallucinatory imagery of Charles Baudelaire and the French Symbolists. In his prose poem Favors of the Moon Baudelaire addresses the image of the fearful goddess, the fateful godmother, the poisonous nurse of all the moonstruck of the world. The poem, which is known to have inspired Baziotess Mirror at Midnight, completed in 1942, alludes to ominous flowers that are like the censers of an unknown rite, a phrase uncannily applicable to Pollocks bouquet at the upper right. Although it is possible that Pollock knew the poem, it is likelier that he was affected in a more general way by the interest in Baudelaire and the Symbolists that was pervasive during the period.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMark Rothko (born Marcus Rothkovitz) immigrated to the United States from Russia (now Latvia) at the age of ten. He briefly attended Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, but did not complete his degree. Rather, he moved to New York, where he began taking art classes at the Art Students League with Max Weber, one of the only professors there to have firsthand knowledge of and enthusiasm for European modernism (the majority emphasized traditional realism). Rothko's early expressionist paintings on everyday subjects reflected Weber's influence as well as that of artists such as Marc Chagall and Chaim Soutine. In the late 1920s his acquaintance with the American artist Milton Avery, who served as mentor to Rothko and a group of young artists that included Adolph Gottlieb, exposed him to new approaches to color and form.\nFrom 1936 to 1939 Rothko participated in art projects supported by the Works Progress Administration, a government agency founded in the aftermath of the Great Depression to help provide jobs to the unemployed. In addition, he banded together with like-minded artists to mount exhibitions of their work and combat the stranglehold of regionalism in American art. It was also at this time that Rothko had his first exposure to Surrealism. He attended several exhibitions of Surrealist work, including an important 1936 survey at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and met Surrealist emigres, such as Andre Breton, Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy, and Matta, who had fled to New York during World War II.\nIn the late 1930s Rothko and Gottlieb adapted Avery's method of using different registers to structure the composition in a series of paintings that incorporated mythic symbols and archetypal figures drawn from Surrealism, the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung's theories of the collective unconscious, and primitive and archaic art. Rothko also found inspiration in literary and philosophical texts ranging from ancient Greek tragedy to Friedrich Nietzsche's Die Geburt der Tragodie aus dem Geiste der Musik (The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music, 1872). Untitled (1942), exemplifies this period in Rothko's development. It is divided into three tiers: the uppermost containing a large form composed of disembodied facial parts, which appear to preside, godlike, over the canvas; the middle layer occupied by the head and torso of a deer; and the bottom register with the deer's feet, talons, and hands. This division of the canvas into godly and earthly realms is repeated in several works of the period and echoes Rothko's 1945 statement that \"our paintings, like all myths, combine shreds of reality with what is considered 'unreal' and insist upon the validity of the merger.\"1\n1.

During these years, he returned to the themes and iconography of Theosophy, an esoteric philosophy that sought to understand the connections between the universe, the divine, and the individual that had interested the artist before World War I. The central motif of the tentacled, amoeba-like form in Fragments recurs in Kandinsky's late work, and has been interpreted as a Theosophical cypher for greed or a stand-in for the complex emotions felt throughout Europe in the wake of World War II.Fragments is divided into independent floating elements, which include a miniature picture within a picture. This compositional device first appeared in Kandinsky's work in 1929, and he used it to enforce spatial relationships and to render the illusion of three-dimensionality. In Fragments, four separate amalgamations of colors, forms, and odd shapes are suspended in a field of mosaic-like elements, the smaller pictures more vividly colored than their muted ground. The artist wished the viewer to feel compelled, by virtue of layered planes and seemingly recessive space, to mentally enter his paintings.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1943 Robert Motherwell and Jackson Pollock experimented with collage in response to Peggy Guggenheims initial preparations for a show of works in the medium at Art of This Century. The exhibition was to include examples by the foremost European practitioners, such as Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Kurt Schwitters. Though Pollocks interest in the technique soon waned, Motherwells concern with it endured. Personage (Autoportrait) (which has previously been known as Surprise and Inspiration, a title assigned by Guggenheim or someone in her circle1) was one of several important examples Motherwell produced in 194344.Motherwell acknowledged that the work might, in a sense, evoke an embodiment of self-image. Although a blocky, somewhat mournful figure can be imagined, Personage (Autoportrait) is more readily perceived as a nonreferential coloristic and spatial construction. A jagged horizontal-vertical mesh organizes the composition. The alignment of the edges of the cut, torn, and glued paper provides the grid, which has a physical, planar dimension. Not only does the paper structure the work architectonically, but it serves as a support for vigorously applied paint. The energy of handling and the uneven oval shapes separated by a black line in this early collage foreshadow the powerful facture and recurrent motifs of Motherwells later work.Lucy Flint1. See H. H.

    "description": "\nDescription\nArshile Gorky spent the greater part of 1944 at Crooked Run Farm in Hamilton, Virginia, where he produced a large number of drawings, many of which were conceived as preliminary studies for paintings. This work is preceded by such a study, a closely related untitled drawing of 1944 that sets out its motifs, their ordering within the composition, and the arrangement of color. Apart from the transformation of an empty contour at the upper center into a solid, anchored black form, only insignificant compositional and coloristic changes appear in the finished painting.Gorkys enthusiastic response to the natural surroundings of rural Virginia infused his work with expressive freedom. Landscape references appear in Untitled; though the white ground is uniform, it is empty at the very top of the canvas, suggesting a slice of sky, while the earth below is replete with vegetal shapes and floral colors. A clear gravitational sense is produced by the dripping of paint thinned with turpentine, a technique suggested by Matta. As in They Will Take My Island of the same year, an aggressive diagonal accent cuts through the upper center of the canvas.The techniques and content of Surrealism influenced the development of Gorkys language of free, organic, vitally curvilinear forms. Joan Miros example is particularly evident here, in the disposition of floating abstract units on an indeterminate background, and in details such as flamelike shapes, dotted ovals, and suggestions of genitals. Unlike Miro, however, Gorky enmeshes his forms with one another to create the overall structure. Textured, insubstantial clouds of color occasionally pertain to the graphic form they accompany, but more often are independent elements, as in the work of Vasily Kandinsky. The curves, inflection, and directionality of Gorkys line likewise free it from descriptive function. In his emphasis on the autonomous expressive potential of line, form, and color, Gorky anticipated the concerns of Abstract Expressionism.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the decades following World War II, a new artistic vanguard emerged, particularly in New York, which introduced radical new directions in art. The war and its aftermath were at the underpinnings of the movement that became known as Abstract Expressionism. These artists, anxiously aware of human irrationality and vulnerability, expressed their concerns in an abstract art that chronicled the ardor and exigencies of modern life. Their heroic aspirations are most evident in Jackson Pollocks innovative drip paintings that forever altered the course of American art.Arriving in New York in 1930 from the West Coast, Pollock began working with figuration of both human and imaginary beings. Most of this imagery was connected to that of American Indian sand painting and the Mexican muralists he saw as a youth and that reemerged through psychoanalysis to treat his lifelong alcoholism. His first fully mature worksdating between 1942 and 1947use an idiosyncratic iconography he developed in part as a response to Surrealism, popular in New York with its numerous European exiles from World War II. Employing mythical subject matter, calligraphic markings, and a vibrant and distinctive color palette, Pollock produced emotionally charged works that retain figurative subject matter yet emphasize abstract qualities.The year 1943 proved to be a watershed year for Pollock, principally due to his introduction to Peggy Guggenheim, who had opened her New York gallery Art of This Century the year before. Encouraged by Marcel Duchamp and Matta, among others, Guggenheim offered Pollock a monthly stipend, which allowed him to devote all his time to painting. In this same year he had his first solo show at the gallery. Among the works from this period, Two (194345), depicts a figurative subject in emblematic, abstract terms derived from various sources, among them tribal painting and Pablo Picassos Cubist works. Rapidly applied strokes of thick black paint harshly delimit the two totemic figures. A columnar figure on the left, probably male, faces the center. Black contours only partially delineate the white and flesh colored areas that signify his body, as Pollock separates and liberates line from a descriptive function. The figure on the right, possibly female, bends and thrusts as it approaches the static figure on the lefta sexual union of the two is implied at the juncture of their bodies in the center of the canvas. Brought together in agitated union, the two figures suggest the primacy of the male and the female in the genesis of human life.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nLike the examples of William Baziotes, Robert Motherwell, and Mark Rothko in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Jamais dates from the formative, exploratory period of Abstract Expressionism. Although the influence of Surrealism pervaded the work of these artists in the early forties, they were moving toward distinctive independent styles.Until 194647 the single upright figure dominated Clyfford Stills painting. In its elongation and expressionistic distortion, this element is reminiscent of figures painted by Joan Miro and Pablo Picasso in the 1930s. Here the figure is barely particularized, appearing as a black flame or cleft in the blazing environment that surrounds it. Later it was to disappear entirely within the craggy, tenebrous abstractions for which Still is best known. The sphere, which interrupts the thrusting verticality of his tense lines in several of these early works, was also to vanish. Concern with the contrast of light and dark was to become increasingly important and was emphasized by jarring color juxtapositions. The canvas, already large in this example, was to reach monumental proportions and create an impact rivaling that of the viewers own environment.The present painting is one of the few by Still bearing its original title. He disdained titles, and discarded those he had given to early works because he considered that they too strongly influenced the observers experience of the painting. Indeed, Jamais (French for never) lends an air of finality and melancholy to this scene and encourages one to read the figure as howling in protest or despair above a setting sun.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWilliam Baziotes and other members of the New York School were influenced by the European Surrealists who had fled to the United States during World War II. Like the Surrealists, Baziotes used objects in his environment as triggers for the memory of early sensations or as conduits to the unconscious. This procedure produced in him an acutely sensitized state of mind that he attempted to formulate visually in his paintings. Baziotes saw this visual manifestation of states of mind as parallel to the literary achievement of the Symbolist poets and of Marcel Proust, whose work he much admired.Baziotes makes allusions in his paintings to the external world of objects, but these remain elusive and changeable. He usually added his titles after the compositions had emerged through intuitive decisions. Although the titles do not identify subject matter, they nevertheless guide interpretation. Thus, the title of the present work may encourage one to experience the mood of an interior space illuminated by diffused twilight. An atmosphere of nostalgic reverie is evoked by scumbled, weathered layers of gouache in which pastel colors predominate. Unlike Baziotes's most characteristic works, in which biomorphic shapes float freely on an indefinite background, The Room (1945) is constructed architectonically. The gridded structure derives from Piet Mondrian and the Cubists, models for Baziotes before his encounter with the Surrealists.Lucy Flint\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the early 1940s, Adolph Gottlieb was one of several American artists who responded to the horrors of the Second World War by turning to archaic myth and so-called primitive art. Dismissing the reigning schools of American painting as hopelessly provincial and inadequate to the historical moment, yet wishing to forge a path distinct from European Surrealism, Gottlieb found in the tribal art of Africa, Oceania, and North America a model for the expression of essential, universal truths. His belief in a global language of art lay behind the series of paintings he initiated in 1941, his Pictographs, which he continued until the end of the next decade. In these works, Gottlieb placed hieroglyphic-like and totemlike signsfrom body parts, such as eyes and hands, to schematized animalsin the cells of flat, loosely painted grids. The grid format had its immediate antecedent in a group of enigmatic still lifes (193940), featuring objects set into boxes with multiple compartments. Critics and art historians have pointed to numerous art-historical precedents for this motif, such as the paintings of Piet Mondrian and Joaquin Torres-Garcia as well as the box constructions of Joseph Cornell. For Gottlieb, however, the nonhierarchical compartmentalization of the canvas was primarily a vehicle for facilitating the mysterious juxtaposition of archetypal signs. Gottlieb arranged his signs intuitively, in a process he described as free association, and he intended for the paintings to be received at a purely visual level, rather than read and deciphered like language. While his earliest Pictographs take the Oedipus myth as their subject, those of the mid-1940s, such as Augury (1945), are broader in reference, with titles suggesting magic and prophecy.Gottliebs paintings underwent another significant transformation in the 1950s, as he abandoned the grid, simplified his forms, and greatly increased the scale of his canvases. In the vertical Bursts he began in 1957, of which Mist (1961) is an example, a diffused, disclike form in the upper zone hovers over an explosion of calligraphic brushstrokes in the lower zone. Despite their abstraction, the Bursts call forth a range of associations, from landscapes and cosmic forms to nuclear mushroom clouds. Although at first glance these works may appear wholly unrelated from the earlier Pictographs, both series rely on the juxtaposition of forms and are characterized by an underlying dualism. While the Pictographs merge irrational symbols and an automatist process with the rational, preconceived order of the grid, the Bursts assemble in single canvases the two poles of Abstract Expressionist paintingthe so-called Color Field and Action schools of Gottliebs contemporariesin a tense balance.Ted Mann\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMeticulously painted and typically consisting of objects that resemble marine forms and rocks scattered in a vast landscape, Yves Tanguys work succeededmore than that of any other Surrealist painterin creating a tangible but inexplicable reality that simulated a dream. Inspired by the harsh peninsulas, rough cliffs, and neolithic rock formations of his native Brittany along Frances northern coast, Tanguy embraced eerie landscape in picture after picture.Escaping the onslaught of World War II in 1939, Tanguy immigrated to Woodbury, Connecticut, with painter Kay Sage, who became his second wife the following year. In the early 1940s, he created a number of pictures that differed from his earlier style in size, boldness of color, and richness of form. While visiting his friends the Surrealist artists Max Ernst and Dorothea Tanning at their home in Sedona, Arizona, Tanguy was deeply affected by the majesty of the desert: mammoth red rock plateaus, recessed canyons, and blinding sunlight enriched his pictorial evolution.In Tanguys American period, rocklike formations absorb over half of each pictures height, radically altering the compositional space. At the same time, he continued to push his objects toward the bottom of the canvas, balancing the contrast between hard ground and soft sky. The isolated and sparsely placed objects of earlier works were now increasingly superseded by monumental architectonic figures. In 1945, Tanguy painted a group of boldly colored abstract landscapes, including There, Motion Has Not Yet Ceased (La ne finit pas encore le mouvement). In this work, a group of osseous figures outfitted in what seems to be military costumes confront a rectangular contraption defended by red-and white-striped lances, into which an assortment of organ parts is crowded. This confrontation of merciless myrmidons and victims may be read as Tanguys commentary on the Holocausts gas chambers.Though self-taught, Tanguy developed a remarkable mastery of oil painting. Incorporating the childhood fantasies and Celtic myths of Brittany, allusions to natural topography, and the Surrealist fascination with the unconscious, Tanguys work defines a fully realized universe. His dreamscapes, at once alien and familiar, offer an accessible pathway to the realms of the human imagination.Susan Davidson\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn New York in the winter of 194546, Peggy Guggenheim commissioned Alexander Calder to make a silver bedhead.1 His design combines fish, insect, and plant motifs in an exuberant conflation of the worlds of sea and garden. The two fish at the lower left are free-hanging elements. The outer curve of a large spiral comprises the basic circular structure of the bedhead, which is elaborated with decorations of hammered and cut silver. Although these botanical forms are fixed permanently in position, their curving, twisting contours nonetheless convey a sense of perpetual natural motion.Calder first twisted wire into three-dimensional forms in his wire sculptures of the mid-1920s. Subsequently, he twisted, cut, and hammered wire and gold, silver and brass into jewelry for his friends and patrons. It has been suggested that the delicate and slender forms of some of Calders metal constructions of the early 1940s are indebted to his jewelry of the 1930s, which included both simple animal motifs and curvilinear or spiraling abstract forms.2 Calders book illustrations also contributed to the development of a graphic lyricism in his sculpture. Many of the vegetal forms in the bedhead share the spontaneity and inventiveness of Calders line-etching illustrations. In particular, the soaring zigzag fern motif on the left and the numerous spiral-shaped blossoms anticipate the illustrations executed in 1946 for Eunice Clarks Fables of La Fontaine (for example, the Stag and the Vine).The compressed, shallow relief of this piece answers neatly the practical demands of Guggenheims commission for a bedhead. This project allowed Calder to exercise his calligraphic skills not only in the more conventional realm of book illustration but also in drawing on a blank wall with a line of silver metal. The worked surface of the hammered silver, which reflects light in countless directions, adds variety and a three-dimensional presence to each of Calders lines.Elizabeth C. Childs1. P.

    "description": "\nDescription\nNaum Gabo became a leading exponent of Constructivismwhich viewed space as a continuum rather than a monolithic volumeafter returning to Russia following the Revolution of 1917. Born Naum Neemia Pevsner and younger brother of artist Antoine Pevsner, he had originally trained to be an engineer. While traveling in Europe, he studied building techniques and observed emerging modernist currents, both inspiring him to become a sculptor. In 1920, five years after he created and signed his first construction as Gabo, he and Pevsner published in Moscow the  \"Realisticheskii manifest\" (\"Realistic Manifesto\"), which articulated their theories on Constructivism and solidified Gabos role as a pioneer of modern sculpture.\nGabo considered Column (ca. 1923), of which several versions exist, to be significant to his artistic development. For him, the work represented the height of his search for an image which would fuse the sculptural element with the architectural element into one unit. Originally intended as a maquette for a monument that was never built, it was made after Gabo had immigrated to Germany. Rather than carving it out of a single block, he built Column up into space by means of a rational geometric vocabulary. The result is a virtually symmetrical sculpture composed of transparent and intersecting vertical planes, exposing the works axial center.\nLinear Construction in Space No. 1 (ca. 194546) further emphasizes Gabos predilection for modern building supplies, as opposed to traditional ones like marble, clay, or bronze. The rigid Perspex frame with stretched nylon filaments, a design that characterizes Gabos later spherical works, again creates the illusion of continuous depth. This work too exists in several reconstructions executed after the initial template, like the version now at the Guggenheim Museum. Gabos duplication of forms and insistence on everyday materials is akin to the methodical processes of industrial production.\nUltimately, utopian ideals underscore Gabos Constructivist works. Rejecting the past and freeing art from the imitation of nature, he believed that his sculptures helped build more perfected social and spiritual life. His plastic sculptures are not just literally transparent in surface quality. In dematerializing mass and surface, he also meant to provide a conduit to a new realitya universal reality. Strongly influenced by fellow artist Vasily Kandinsky, who promoted the spiritual nature of art making, Gabo aimed to produce objects that appeal more to our minds and our feelings than to our crude physical senses.\nMegan Fontanella\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nA grotesque male nude dominates Will to Power, his gritty roughness, burly proportions, inlaid stone teeth, and glass fragments for eyes giving him a fierce and threatening air. But the figures aggressive machismo is itself threatened by the very stance he assumes: hands held behind the back, his gesture is either one of unexpected receptivity or of helpless captivity. The title refers to a central tenet of Nazi ideology, taken from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. But in a single deft stroke, Dubuffets caricature mocks Fascisms claims to authority as it emasculates romanticized male aggression.Dubuffets painting style, which he called Art Brut (raw art), was contrary to everything expected of a painter in the French tradition and dealt a serious blow to the usual aesthetic assumptions. Inspired by graffiti and art made by the mentally ill, Dubuffet insisted that his protest was against specious notions of beauty inherited from the Greeks and cultivated by magazine covers. In Triumph and Glory, the female nudetreated by most artists with venerationreceives no more charitable treatment than her male counterpart in Will to Power. One of 36 female nudes known as the Corps des dames series, she lacks psychological presence and personal identity, and could easily be perceived as an abomination.While the art of primitive cultures and unschooled practitioners was of special importance to Dubuffet, he was also interested in a disparate array of found objects and materials. Door with Couch Grass, an assemblage of several paintings that he cut down and pieced together to represent a wall, doorstep, and the ground, typifies his insatiable interest in found patterns, textures, and materials. The extraordinary range of techniques that Dubuffet employed in this work includes creating successive layers of paint by shaking a brush over the painting and covering it with a spray of tiny droplets, scattering sand over the surface, and scratching it with the tines of a fork. In his attempt to rehabilitate values and materials dismissed by Western aesthetics, what mattered to Dubuffet was unbridled energy, spontaneity, and truth to selfand with them, a spirit of insubordination and impertinence.Jan Avgikos\r\n        ",

It was also tied to his long-standing affiliation with the Bauhaus, the German artistic and educational community founded by Walter Gropius and dedicated to the development of a universally accessible design vocabulary. With his Bauhaus colleagues, who included Josef Albers, Vasily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and Oskar Schlemmer, he strove to define an objective science of essential forms, colors, and materials, the use of which would promote a more unified social environment.Moholy-Nagy firmly believed that the art of the present must parallel contemporary reality in order to successfully communicate meaning to a public surrounded by new technological advancements. Hence, he considered traditional, mimetic painting and sculpture obsolete and turned to pure geometric abstraction filtered through the stylistic influence of Russian Constructivism. Inspired by the structural and formal capacities of modern, synthetic materials, Moholy-Nagy experimented with transparent and opaque plastics, particularly Celluloid, Bakelite, Trolitan, and Plexiglas. In 1923 he created his first painting on clear plastic, giving physical form to his profound interest in the effects of light, which would later be manifest in film and photography as well as in transparent sculptures, such as the kinetic Dual Form with Chromium Rods. A II and AXL II illustrate how Moholy-Nagy translated his efforts to manipulate light as a new plastic medium onto the painted canvas. In the first painting, the colored parallelograms and circles appear to be almost translucent as one plane overlaps the next and their hues shift accordingly. In the second, the intersecting transparent forms read as converging beams of light. A sense of layered space, echoing the artists three-dimensional plastic paintings constructed with clear, projecting planes, was thus achieved. The contrived play of shadow and illumination on these canvases underscores the artists conviction that light could be harnessed as an effective aesthetic medium, just as color in painting and tone in music.Nancy Spector \r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn this transitional work of 1946 the subtle persistence of the Cubist grid system is felt in the panels that organize the composition and orient major pictorial details in vertical or horizontal positions. However, Jackson Pollocks dependence on Pablo Picasso has virtually dissolved, giving way to a more automatic, fluidly expressive style. Line loses its descriptive function and begins to assume a self-sufficient role, the rhythm, duration, and direction of each brushstroke responding to the artists instinctual gesture. The compositional focus is multiplied and decentralized, and areas of intense activity fill the entire surface. Fragmented figural elements are increasingly integrated into the shallow pictorial space, as background, foreground, and object merge and the texture of the paint gains in importance. By 1945 the vigor and originality of Pollocks work had prompted the critic Clement Greenberg, one of his earliest champions, to write in The Nation of April 7: Jackson Pollocks second one-man show at Art of This Century . . . establishes him, in my opinion, as the strongest painter of his generation and perhaps the greatest one to appear since Miro.Primitive art forms are alluded to in the crudely drawn arrows, cult and stick figures, and ornamental markings discernable in Circumcision. Totemic figures (the rotund being standing at the left and the owl-like creature at upper center) are posed stiffly, observing what seems to be a scene of violence in the center of the canvas. The enactment of a rite of passage is suggested, but the visual evidence does not encourage a specific reading.

In his work of this period evanescent biomorphic shapes float within an atmospheric haze. Resembling rudimentary life forms or primitive subaquatic plants and creatures, these shapes are intended to provide a visible equivalent of images lodged in the subconscious. Though he drew primarily on his innermost sensations, Rothko also looked toward earlier art. The example of Joan Miro is evoked in Sacrifice in the dotted line, the flame, the amorphic personage at the lower left, and in the meandering threadlike tendrils.Figurative and literary allusions, albeit disguised, persist here. Architectural elements contrast with the aquatic forms and nebulous milieu: the horizontal registers are articulated like moldings, as in an untitled oil painting by Rothko of 193940, in which a frieze of faces appears between an undulating cornice and two ornamental tiers. The title may be inspired by Rothkos interest in Greek tragedy and Friedrich Nietzsches examination of its origins. Despite the persistence of these references, overtly representational images have disappeared, signaling a move toward the complete abstraction of Rothkos mature style. In its horizontal zoning, cloudlike texture, and blurred contours, Sacrifice anticipates his characteristic, fully evolved Color-Field paintings.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn The Surrealist Victor Brauner borrows motifs from the tarot to create a portrait of himself as a young man. The tarot, a set of seventy-eight illustrated cards used in fortune telling, was a subject of widespread interest to Brauner and other Surrealists. Four of these cards, for example, appeared on Andre Derains cover for the December 1933 issue of Minotaure. A group including Brauner even produced a deck of cards in 194041 that was probably a tarot. One tarot card, the Juggler (the first card in the Marseille tarot deck), provided Brauner with a key prototype for his self-portrait: the Surrealists large hat, medieval costume, and the position of his arms all derive from this figure who, like Brauners subject, stands behind a table displaying a knife, a goblet, and coins.1 The tarot Juggler appropriately symbolizes the creativity of the Surrealist poet, for it refers to the capacity of each individual to create his own personality through intelligence, wit, and initiative, and thus to play with his own future, as the juggler manipulates his baton.In another tarot deck known as the Waite tarot, the first card of the Major Arcana is the Magician rather than the Juggler, although both share many attributes. A sign of infinity, * (the symbol of life), that appears above the Magicians head is also depicted on the hat of Brauners Surrealist. Drawing on the Juggler-Magician prototype, Brauner illustrates the traditional signs of the four suits in the tarot deck: wands, cups, swords, and coins (symbols of the elements of natural lifefire, water, air, and earth, respectively). These objects and all natural life are controlled by the Juggler, just as all creative life is at the disposal of the Surrealist poet, who wields his pen as the Juggler brandishes his wand.Brauner depicted the Juggler and a Popess (a figure from the Marseille Tarot) in another painting of 1947, The Lovers (Private Collection, Paris). The inscriptions at either side of that canvas, PastPresentFuture and Fate/NecessityWill/MagicSurreality/Liberty, are written in Brauners hand on the back of the Peggy Guggenheim canvas. These inscriptions convey the artists belief that Surrealism could be a path to artistic freedom.Elizabeth C. Childs1. See N. and E.

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlberto Giacometti was 20 years old when he settled in Paris in order to pursue the career of a sculptor. He studied classical sculpture and the predominant Cubist idioms, but it was not until he began to interpret primitive objects that he was able to liberate himself from the influence of his teachers. Spoon Woman, one of the artists first mature works, explores the metaphor employed in ceremonial spoons of the African Dan culture, in which the bowl of the utensil can be equated with a womans womb. But Giacomettis life-size sculpture reverses the equivalence. As the art historian and theorist Rosalind Krauss has noted, By taking the metaphor and inverting it, so that a spoon is like a woman becomes a woman is like a spoon, Giacometti was able to intensify the idea and to make it universal by generalizing the forms of the sometimes rather naturalistic African carvings toward a more prismatic abstraction.Giacometti joined the ranks of the Surrealists in 1929, only to break with them acrimoniously six years later, when he decided to work from models rather than strictly from his imagination. Yet even in Nose there is something of the Surrealist tendency toward the fantastic in the incredible proboscis. In this work, Giacometti suspended a head from a cross bar in a rectangular cage, thus implying that the pendant head could be prodded to swing, the nose further extending beyond the confines of its prison. There is a vague threat in the shape of the head: the configuration of nose, skull, and neck recalls the barrel, chassis, and handle of a gun. However, the wide-open mouth suggests a scream of anguish, and the cord attaching it to its cage evokes the gallows. Nose should be seen within the context of postwar existential angst that was voiced by Jean-Paul Sartre, a friend of the artist.In Diego, a painting of his brother, Giacometti continued in this vein, insinuating the loneliness caused by each individuals isolation within his own existence. Like the head in Nose, the solitary Diego is presented in the confines of a cagelike structure of lines denoting the architecture of the room. The atmosphere of melancholy is further suggested both by the artists muted palette that seems to drain life from the sitter, and the figures near-transparency in a haze of reworked paint.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAn early example of the mature style with which Giacometti is usually identified, this figure is more elongated and dematerialized than Woman Walking, although it retains that sculptures frontality and immobility. A sense of ghostly fragility detaches the figure from the world around it, despite the crusty materiality of the surfaces, as animated and responsive to light as those of Rodin.Giacometti exploited the contradictions of perception in the haunting, incorporeal sculptures of this period. His matchstick-sized figures of 194246 demonstrate the effect of distance on size and comment on the notion that the essence of an individual persists even as the body appears to vanish, that is, to become nonexistent. Even his large-scale standing women and striding men seem miniaturized and insubstantial. In 1947 the sculptor commented that lifesize figures irritate me, after all, because a person passing by on the street has no weight; in any case hes much lighter than the same person when hes dead or has fainted. He keeps his balance with his legs. You dont feel your weight. I wantedwithout having thought about itto reproduce this lightness, and that by making the body so thin.1 Giacometti sought to convey several notions simultaneously in his attenuated plastic forms: ones consciousness of the nonmaterial presence of another person, the insubstantiality of the physical body housing that presence, and the paradoxical nature of perception. The base from which the woman appears to grow like a tree is tilted, emphasizing the verticality of the figure as well as reiterating the contours of the merged feet.Giacometti had the present cast made expressly for Peggy Guggenheim.Lucy Flint1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlchemy is one of Jackson Pollocks earliest poured paintings, executed in the revolutionary technique that constituted his most significant contribution to twentieth-century art. After long deliberation before the empty canvas, he used his entire body in a picture-making process that can be described as drawing in paint. By pouring streams of commercial paint onto the canvas from a can with the aid of a stick, Pollock made obsolete the conventions and tools of traditional easel painting. He often tacked the unstretched canvas onto the floor in an approach he likened to that of the Navajo Indian sandpainters, explaining that on the floor I am more at ease. I feel nearer, more a part of the painting, since this way I can walk around it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting.1 Surrealist notions of chance and automatism are given full expression in Pollocks classic poured paintings, in which line no longer serves to describe shape or enclose form, but exists as an autonomous event, charting the movements of the artists body. As the line thins and thickens it speeds and slows, its appearance modified by chance behavior of the medium such as bleeding, pooling, or blistering.When Alchemy is viewed from a distance, its large scale and even emphasis encourage the viewer to experience the painting as an environment. The layering and interpenetration of the labyrinthine skeins give the whole a dense and generalized appearance. The textured surface is like a wall on which primitive signs are inscribed with white pigment squeezed directly from the tube. Interpretations of these markings have frequently relied on the title Alchemy; however, this was assigned not by Pollock, but by Ralph Manheim and his wife, neighbors of the Pollocks in East Hampton.Lucy Flint \r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nLike Alchemy, Enchanted Forest exemplifies Jackson Pollocks mature abstract compositions created by the pouring, dripping, and splattering of paint on large, unstretched canvases. In Enchanted Forest Pollock opens up the more dense construction of layered color found in works such as Alchemy by allowing large areas of white to breathe amidst the network of moving, expanding line. He also reduces his palette to a restrained selection of gold, black, red, and white. Pollock creates a delicate balance of form and color through orchestrating syncopated rhythms of lines that surge, swell, retreat, and pause only briefly before plunging anew into continuous, lyrical motion. Ones eye follows eagerly, pursuing first one dripping rope of color and then another, without being arrested by any dominant focus. Rather than describing a form, Pollocks line thus becomes continuous form itself.Michael Fried has described Pollocks achievement: [His] all-over line does not give rise to positive and negative areas. There is no inside or outside to Pollocks line or to the space through which it moves. And that is tantamount to claiming that line, in Pollocks all-over drip paintings of 194750, has been freed at last from the job of describing contours and bounding shapes.1 It is this redefinition of the traditional capacity of the artists formal means that distinguishes Pollocks art in the history of Modernism.Elizabeth C.

Like other New York School artists, Rothko used abstract means to express universal human emotions, earnestly striving to create an art of awe-inspiring intensity for a secular world.In order to explain the power of his canvases, some art historians have cited their compositional similarity to Romantic landscape painting and Christian altar decoration. Anna Chave suggests that Rothkos early interest in religious iconography underlies his later work. She sees a reference to a Madonna and Child in Untitled, an apparently abstract work that developed out of the Surrealistic biological fantasies that he had been painting in the early 1940s. For Chave, mature paintings such as Untitled (Violet, Black, Orange, Yellow on White and Red) metaphorically encompass the cycle of life from cradle to grave, in part by harboring an oblique reference to both adorations and entombments. The stacked rectangles may be read vertically as an abstracted Virgin bisected by horizontal divisions that indicate the supine Christ. Even without Chaves argument, it is clear that Rothko hoped to harness the grandeur of religious painting. The principles of frontality and iconic imagery in his mature works are common to traditional altarpieces, and both formats have similar dimensions and proportions. Often larger than a human being, Rothkos canvases inspire the kind of wonder and reverence traditionally associated with monumental religious or landscape painting.It was Rothkos euphoric veils of diaphanous pure color that led critics to praise him as a sensualist and a colorist, which pained him because he believed that his champions had lost sight of his serious intentions. For him the canvases enacted a violent battle of oppositesvertical versus horizontal, hot color versus coldinvoking the existential conflicts of modernity. The Black Paintings, begun in the year before the artists suicide, confirm Rothkos belief that his work encompassed tragedy. The desolation of canvases such as Untitled (Black on Grey), drained of color and choked by a white borderrather than suggesting the free-floating forms or veiled layers of his earlier workindicate that, as Rothko asserted, his paintings are about death.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the late 1940s Alberto Giacometti produced attenuated thin figures not only of the life-size height of Standing Woman, but also on the miniature scale of the figures who inhabit his Piazza of 194748. Four men stride across a wide plaza, each moving toward the center, yet none apparently directed toward an encounter with one another. A single woman, whose stiff posture recalls Standing Woman, stands isolated and motionless near the center. The featureless figures exist independently within their haphazardly grouped unity, their multiple, nonconverging paths suggesting individual ambitions and absorptions.The flat bronze slab on which the figures stand serves both as base and as the plaza setting. Such a tabular format first appears in The Palace at 4 a.m., 193233, a highly theatrical work of Giacomettis Surrealist period. Giacometti began placing individual figures on large bases as early as 1942, but only in 1948, in Three Men Walking, did a group of attenuated figures appear on a thin square bronze base that also suggests a city square.Giacomettis scene derives from modern urban experience. He states: In the street people astound and interest me more than any sculpture or painting. Every second the people stream together and go apart, then they approach each other to get closer to one another. They unceasingly form and re-form living compositions in unbelievable complexity. . . . Its the totality of this life that I want to reproduce in everything I do. . . .1There are five different casts of this work, and a somewhat larger version with the figures placed in slightly different positions exists in five casts as well. In all of these sculptures, an eye-level examination of the work alters the scale of miniaturization first perceived by the viewer. The vastness of the empty piazza and the anonymity of the figures are revealed by such closeup scrutiny.Elizabeth C. Childs1. Quoted in Alberto Giacometti: A Retrospective Exhibition, exh. cat.

    "description": "\nDescription\nNearly ten years after Louise Bourgeois moved to New York from her native Paris, she embarked on a series of approximately 80 carved and assembled wooden sculptures known as Personnages, which embody the essential themes and obsessions of all her subsequent work. Described by Bourgeois as her first truly mature artistic effort, these life-size, semi-abstract, vaguely anthropomorphic sculptures created between 1945 and 1955 functioned as surrogates for real people close to hersome departed, some forsaken, and some eminently present. Seventeen of these Personnagesincluding Dagger Childwere featured in a solo exhibition at New Yorks Peridot Gallery in 1949. The installation underscored the sculptures figurative quality. Shown without bases, the thin, freestanding, vertical forms inhabited the room in small clusters like visitors conversing while perusing the exhibition. Bourgeois considered this spatial arrangement a critical component of the presentation because she intended to create a reconstruction of her past with this display of surrogates. Motivated by homesickness, a churning resentment over familial betrayal dating from her childhood, a desire to connect with loved ones, and a wish to control those who perturbed her, the Personnages were as much conjured as they were carved, nailed, and painted. The presence of autobiographical references, the symbolic content of abstract form, and the staged interaction between objects in spaceall enduring motifs in Bourgeoiss artwere conjoined in this early, pivotal exhibition and, in their fusion, perfectly anticipated her haunting installation work of the 1990s, which invokes psychological conditions of the body through architectural metaphors.The Personnages had clear associations with avant-garde art of the late 1940s, particularly in their totemlike structures, which can be read as a three-dimensional correlate to the totemic forms in the early work of Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Mark Tobey. At the time that Bourgeois created these sculptures, she was exhibiting regularly with members of the soon-to-be-christened New York School. And as a European emigre she was well versed in the Surrealists fascination with the primitive in relation to the unconscious. Regardless of such shared concerns, Bourgeois has always spoken with an unmistakably unique voice, one that struggles to articulate the vicissitudes of her life. Femme Volage, for instance, is a self-described self-portrait. With this in mind, it is possible to see the Personnages also as stylized images of the sewing toolsneedles, bobbins, and so onthat in Bourgeoiss visual vocabulary have come to symbolize her parents, who were tapestry restorers.Nancy Spector\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMarino Marini drew on the tradition of Etruscan and Northern European sculpture in developing his themes of the female nude, the portrait bust, and the equestrian figure. By interpreting classical themes in light of modern concerns and with modern techniques, he sought to contribute a mythic image that would be applicable in a contemporary context.The evolution of the subject of the horse and rider reflects Marinis personal response to that changing context. The theme first appears in his work in 1936, when the proportions of horse and rider are relatively slender and both figures are poised, formal, and calm. By the following year the horse rears and the rider gestures. In 1940 the forms become simplified and more archaic in spirit, and the proportions become squatter. By the late 1940s the horse is planted immobile with its neck extended, strained, ears pinned back, and mouth open, as in the present example, which conveys the qualities characteristic of this period of Marinis workaffirmation and charged strength associated explicitly with sexual potency. Later, the rider becomes increasingly oblivious of his mount, involved in his own visions or anxieties. Eventually he was to topple from the horse as it fell to the ground in an apocalyptic image of lost control, paralleling Marinis feelings of despair and uncertainty about the future of the world.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nBy 1947, Clyfford Still had begun working in the format that he would intensify and refine throughout the rest of his careera large-scale color field crudely applied with palette knives. Still liberated color from illusionary design by allowing large, uninterrupted tonal areas to interlock on a flat plane. He dispensed with typically beautiful colors in favor of more disquieting hues to create unsettling impressions. In 1948, visceral smears of brown, mustard, and dark crimson impasto seem to spread beyond the canvas. The paintings soaring scale and the energy of the roughly painted crags suggest the boundlessness the artist revered. The patches of earth tones in many canvases, including 1948, have been interpreted as organic shapes: parched riverbeds, frozen wastelands, swamps, and even flayed skin. Wishing to avoid the possibility of such associations, Still left his paintings untitled, or identified them simply by the year of their creation. Evocative titles, in the artists opinion, might influence the viewers experience as they contemplate the palpable tension and sense of the infinite that can be found within the canvas.Still espoused what he regarded as particularly American ideals such as absolute freedom and individuality, which were manifested in his works as well as in his artistic career. Although he was given solo exhibitions at Peggy Guggenheims Art of This Century gallery in 1946 and Betty Parsons Gallery in 1947, he disdained the commercial aspects of the art world and became increasingly aloof from the burgeoning New York School, to the point of refusing to exhibit for a period between 1952 and 1958. Although the artist scorned categorization, his expansive canvases dominated by jagged fields of color were influential among the Abstract Expressionist artists he was grouped with, in particular Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko, who shared his interest in the metaphysical sublime. These artists believed that a painting could convey meaning without reference to anything outside of its inherent formal and material qualities. Rather than capture a realistic representation of the world in his abstract paintings, Still sought to create a transcendental experience that was purely visual and impossible to describe with words.Joan Young\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAnimal Woman, F. I. U.: The Defense of Nature, and Untitled by Joseph Beuys may be said to reflect three distinct phases in the artist's career. Animal Woman, an example of Beuys's early work, is closely tied to his years in the workshop of his teacher, Ewald Matare. Beuys accentuated the fetishistic character of the work by finishing the various casts of the statue (there are seven casts and one artist's proof) with different patinas. The grossly enhanced sexual characteristics of Animal Woman (1949), notably the hips and breasts, are in keeping with the type of nature imagery that Matare and he favored during the late 1940s; a primordial female nude was a recurring subject of Beuys's work at this time.By 1962 Beuys had ceased creating objects, turning his attention to performance and sculptural experiments with nontraditional materials. F. I. U.: The Defense of Nature (F. I. U.: Difesa della Natura, 198385) exemplifies the way his life came to merge with his art. The work refers to an ecological campaign that Beuys and his dealer, Lucrezia de Domizio, waged in the 1980s with the help of his students at the art academy he had founded to encourage creativitythe Free International University (hence the F. I. U. of the title). The campaign required the use of a car, pamphlets, copper tubing, and spades that were meant to be plunged vigorously into the Italian countryside. Beuys sold the car, its contents, and two blackboards as part of his routine transformation of performance materials into artworks that would in turn fund other projects.The vitrine Untitled (1984) contains Encounter with Beuys (1984), which consists of felt, fat, copper pieces, and cord, the materials he used repeatedly to describe significant events in his life. The first two materials refer to the pivotal incident in his biography, an alleged wartime plane crash in which mountain people saved his life by wrapping him in felt and fat; copper was used by Beuys to represent spiritual conduction, while cord as a readymade has fascinated artists from Piero Manzoni to Dorothea Rockburne. The placement of autobiographical objects in a vitrine relates particularly to his major 1985 exhibition in Naples, where he installed a series of golden plates and vitrines, suggesting the burial hall of a king. Beuys favored the vitrine for its ready association to ethnographic installations. As part of his fusion of rituals and their fetishes, he believed that art and artifacts could not always be distinguished from one another.Cornelia Lauf\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the decades following World War II, a new artistic vanguard emerged, particularly in New York, that introduced radical new directions in art. The war and its aftermath were at the underpinnings of the movement that became known as Abstract Expressionism. These artists, anxiously aware of human irrationality and vulnerability, expressed their concerns in an abstract art that chronicled the ardor and exigencies of modern life. Their heroic aspirations are most evident in Jackson Pollock's innovative drip paintings that forever altered the course of American art.Arriving in New York in 1930 from the West Coast, Pollock began working with figuration of both human and imaginary beings. Most of this imagery was connected to that of American Indian sand painting and the Mexican muralists he saw as a youth and that reemerged through psychoanalysis to treat his lifelong alcoholism. His first fully mature worksdating between 1942 and 1947use an idiosyncratic iconography he developed in part as a response to Surrealism, popular in New York with its numerous European exiles from World War II. Employing mythical subject matter, calligraphic markings, and a vibrant and distinctive color palette, Pollock produced emotionally charged works that retain figurative subject matter yet emphasize abstract qualities. Arising from this confluence of abstraction and figuration are Pollock's breakthrough works, commonly perceived as pure abstraction and made over the course of an explosive period between late 1947 and 1950 as represented by Untitled (Green Silver). At the time, he also broke free from the standard use of implements, usually abandoning their direct contact with the surface. Working from above the picture plane, he dripped and poured enamel paints on canvases and papers, a method that more precisely controlled the application of line. His preference for the technique of fluid paint spilling from the can or drizzling from the tips of sticks or trowels was heralded by critic Harold Rosenberg as action painting. These unconventional working methods and his own physical presence while creating these works have assumed epic proportions. In the last four years of his lifehe died in an automobile accident on August 11, 1956he produced significantly fewer works, with each further refining his pouring method. Compositionally, they hark back to his earlier style through the reintroduction of figurative elements as in Ocean Greyness, which also addresses his allover abstract technique. Its dramatic, swirling forms set against a dark ground recall Pollock's Eyes in the Heat (1946).\n",

Often larger than a human being, Rothkos canvases inspire the kind of wonder and reverence traditionally associated with monumental religious or landscape painting.It was Rothkos euphoric veils of diaphanous pure color that led critics to praise him as a sensualist and a colorist, which pained him because he believed that his champions had lost sight of his serious intentions. For him the canvases enacted a violent battle of oppositesvertical versus horizontal, hot color versus coldinvoking the existential conflicts of modernity. The Black Paintings, begun in the year before the artists suicide, confirm Rothkos belief that his work encompassed tragedy. The desolation of canvases such as Untitled (Black on Grey), drained of color and choked by a white borderrather than suggesting the free-floating forms or veiled layers of his earlier workindicate that, as Rothko asserted, his paintings are about death.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the decades following World War II, a new artistic vanguard emerged, particularly in New York, that introduced radical new directions in art. The war and its aftermath were at the underpinnings of the movement that became known as Abstract Expressionism. These artists, anxiously aware of human irrationality and vulnerability, expressed their concerns in an abstract art that chronicled the ardor and exigencies of modern life. Their heroic aspirations are most evident in Jackson Pollock's innovative drip paintings that forever altered the course of American art.Arriving in New York in 1930 from the West Coast, Pollock began working with figuration of both human and imaginary beings. Most of this imagery was connected to that of American Indian sand painting and the Mexican muralists he saw as a youth and that reemerged through psychoanalysis to treat his lifelong alcoholism. His first fully mature worksdating between 1942 and 1947use an idiosyncratic iconography he developed in part as a response to Surrealism, popular in New York with its numerous European exiles from World War II. Employing mythical subject matter, calligraphic markings, and a vibrant and distinctive color palette, Pollock produced emotionally charged works that retain figurative subject matter yet emphasize abstract qualities. Arising from this confluence of abstraction and figuration are Pollock's breakthrough works, commonly perceived as pure abstraction and made over the course of an explosive period between late 1947 and 1950 as represented by Untitled (Green Silver). At the time, he also broke free from the standard use of implements, usually abandoning their direct contact with the surface. Working from above the picture plane, he dripped and poured enamel paints on canvases and papers, a method that more precisely controlled the application of line. His preference for the technique of fluid paint spilling from the can or drizzling from the tips of sticks or trowels was heralded by critic Harold Rosenberg as action painting. These unconventional working methods and his own physical presence while creating these works have assumed epic proportions. In the last four years of his lifehe died in an automobile accident on August 11, 1956he produced significantly fewer works, with each further refining his pouring method. Compositionally, they hark back to his earlier style through the reintroduction of figurative elements as in Ocean Greyness, which also addresses his allover abstract technique. Its dramatic, swirling forms set against a dark ground recall Pollock's Eyes in the Heat (1946).\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nA grotesque male nude dominates Will to Power, his gritty roughness, burly proportions, inlaid stone teeth, and glass fragments for eyes giving him a fierce and threatening air. But the figures aggressive machismo is itself threatened by the very stance he assumes: hands held behind the back, his gesture is either one of unexpected receptivity or of helpless captivity. The title refers to a central tenet of Nazi ideology, taken from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. But in a single deft stroke, Dubuffets caricature mocks Fascisms claims to authority as it emasculates romanticized male aggression.Dubuffets painting style, which he called Art Brut (raw art), was contrary to everything expected of a painter in the French tradition and dealt a serious blow to the usual aesthetic assumptions. Inspired by graffiti and art made by the mentally ill, Dubuffet insisted that his protest was against specious notions of beauty inherited from the Greeks and cultivated by magazine covers. In Triumph and Glory, the female nudetreated by most artists with venerationreceives no more charitable treatment than her male counterpart in Will to Power. One of 36 female nudes known as the Corps des dames series, she lacks psychological presence and personal identity, and could easily be perceived as an abomination.While the art of primitive cultures and unschooled practitioners was of special importance to Dubuffet, he was also interested in a disparate array of found objects and materials. Door with Couch Grass, an assemblage of several paintings that he cut down and pieced together to represent a wall, doorstep, and the ground, typifies his insatiable interest in found patterns, textures, and materials. The extraordinary range of techniques that Dubuffet employed in this work includes creating successive layers of paint by shaking a brush over the painting and covering it with a spray of tiny droplets, scattering sand over the surface, and scratching it with the tines of a fork. In his attempt to rehabilitate values and materials dismissed by Western aesthetics, what mattered to Dubuffet was unbridled energy, spontaneity, and truth to selfand with them, a spirit of insubordination and impertinence.Jan Avgikos\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nSimon Hantais Cut Emerald Eye belongs to a series of single figure paintings of imaginary creatures. Painted in February 1950 in Paris, it is one of Hantais retinue of fabulous beings which breath has endowed with life and which move miraculously as Andre Breton put it in his foreword to the artists first Parisian solo exhibition in January 1953 at LEtoile scellee, the recently launched gallery of the Surrealist group.1 The bird-like, heraldic character is depicted with raised arms and bears circular and half-moon shapes on its head. The artists prominently placed signature is scuffed into the paint appearing as graffiti. Characterized by the simultaneous use of diverse painterly procedures and a heavily textured, multilayered ground, Cut Emerald Eye explores the physicality of the gesture and the materiality of paint while expanding on the iconography of postwar Surrealism. Its lacerated surface, scratched and vividly colored details, cut-out forms and chromatic contrasts between earth tones and highly saturated blues and greens reflect Hantais interest in destabilizing the unity of the pictorial plane and the relations between figure and ground. The painting merges the different artistic idioms available in postwar Paris where the Hungarian-born Hantai arrived in September 1948, including, among others, the technical procedures of Surrealist automatism, the gestural tendencies of contemporary French abstraction, and the material practices of artists associated with Art Brut. The use of grattage and overpainting recalls Max Ernsts work, while the stencil-like forms bring to mind Henri Matisses paper cutouts, which had been a lasting influence in Hantais oeuvre since they were first shown in Paris in the summer of 1949.\n1.

Soon he met many other leading artistic figures, among them Andre Breton, the dominant publicist and theorist of Surrealism. The Surrealists, who attempted to unleash the power of the unconscious through explorations of dream states and automatist writing, were fascinated by the mythologies of primitive people. They subscribed to an anthropology that perceived modern primitive cultures as the heirs to an integrated understanding of myth and reality, which they hoped to achieve themselves. Lam, as a Cuban of African, Chinese, and European descent, seemed to the Surrealists to have privileged access to that undifferentiated state of mind. In 1942 the artist returned to Cuba, where he constructed a body of work in a Surrealist idiom, creating symbolic creatures engaged in ritual acts of initiation. Lams vocabulary of vegetal-animal forms was inspired by Afro-Cuban and Haitian Santeria deities. He also associated with the nationalist poets of the Negritude movement, who relied in their work on the images and rhythms of their native culture.Rumblings of the Earth represents a synthesis of Lams concerns in his work of the 1940s. This painting melds his reaction to the European artistic legacy with his own goals and the indigenous traditions of his country. Here, Lam referred to Picassos 1937 Guernica through direct quotations and more abstract correspondences, but he transformed Picassos political statement by replacing the central victim of Guernica, the horse, with a spectral presence bearing a large knife, described by Lam as the instrument of integrity. An aggressive painting, Rumblings of the Earth includes vaginal and phallic references that focus the work thematically on the cycle of birth and death while suggesting ritual initiation and violence. For Lam, revolutionary violence was a means of liberation; in his hands, the victim in Picassos canvas has become the aggressor.In Zambezia, Zambezia Lam depicted an iconic woman partly inspired by the femme-cheval (horse-headed woman) of the Santeria cult.

    "description": "\nDescription\nNearly ten years after Louise Bourgeois moved to New York from her native Paris, she embarked on a series of approximately 80 carved and assembled wooden sculptures known as Personnages, which embody the essential themes and obsessions of all her subsequent work. Described by Bourgeois as her first truly mature artistic effort, these life-size, semi-abstract, vaguely anthropomorphic sculptures created between 1945 and 1955 functioned as surrogates for real people close to hersome departed, some forsaken, and some eminently present. Seventeen of these Personnagesincluding Dagger Childwere featured in a solo exhibition at New Yorks Peridot Gallery in 1949. The installation underscored the sculptures figurative quality. Shown without bases, the thin, freestanding, vertical forms inhabited the room in small clusters like visitors conversing while perusing the exhibition. Bourgeois considered this spatial arrangement a critical component of the presentation because she intended to create a reconstruction of her past with this display of surrogates. Motivated by homesickness, a churning resentment over familial betrayal dating from her childhood, a desire to connect with loved ones, and a wish to control those who perturbed her, the Personnages were as much conjured as they were carved, nailed, and painted. The presence of autobiographical references, the symbolic content of abstract form, and the staged interaction between objects in spaceall enduring motifs in Bourgeoiss artwere conjoined in this early, pivotal exhibition and, in their fusion, perfectly anticipated her haunting installation work of the 1990s, which invokes psychological conditions of the body through architectural metaphors.The Personnages had clear associations with avant-garde art of the late 1940s, particularly in their totemlike structures, which can be read as a three-dimensional correlate to the totemic forms in the early work of Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Mark Tobey. At the time that Bourgeois created these sculptures, she was exhibiting regularly with members of the soon-to-be-christened New York School. And as a European emigre she was well versed in the Surrealists fascination with the primitive in relation to the unconscious. Regardless of such shared concerns, Bourgeois has always spoken with an unmistakably unique voice, one that struggles to articulate the vicissitudes of her life. Femme Volage, for instance, is a self-described self-portrait. With this in mind, it is possible to see the Personnages also as stylized images of the sewing toolsneedles, bobbins, and so onthat in Bourgeoiss visual vocabulary have come to symbolize her parents, who were tapestry restorers.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nA symbolic struggle is expressed between the human and bird halves of the hybrid form in Consciousness of Shock, in which Victor Brauner portrays a complex boat-shaped figure in the course of battling for control of itself. Drawn in the schematic profile style of Egyptian hieroglyphs, a large androgynous head unites with the raised prow of a boat elaborated with breasts. The body of the vessel, directed by rudderlike legs and feet, merges at the stern with the upright body of a bird. Two powerful hands, at the ends of crossed arms, suppress the internal battle by restraining the limbs of the bird, while a third hand doggedly forges progress along the river by paddling. Thus, in keeping with the nature of much psychic conflict, a difficult internal struggle is self-contained, while the vessel-self continues along a predetermined route.Nicolas Calas has suggested that Brauner was inspired by two Egyptian themes, the Sun Barge and the Heavenly Vault, in the creation of this image.1 While a generalized Egyptian style undoubtedly influenced Brauners imagery, it seems more likely that the artist derived this fantastic visual vocabulary from his own imagination, rather from specific art-historical sources.Elizabeth C.

He experimented with a variety of materials to produce thick, ruggedly tactile surfaces that constitute deliberately awkward, vulgar, and abbreviated imagery, often of grotesque faces or female nudes. Dubuffet made the present work with an oil-based mortar, applying it with a palette knife, allowing areas to dry partially, then scraping, gouging, raking, slicing, or wiping them before applying more medium. The resulting surface is so thick that incisions providing the contours and delineating features seem to model form in relief. He wrote that this mortar enabled him to provoke systems of relief in objects where reliefs are least expected, and lent itself, at the same time, to very realistic effects of rugged and stony terrains. I enjoyed the idea that a single medium should have this double (ambiguous) power: to accentuate the actual and familiar character of certain elements (notably in figurations of ground and soils), and yet to precipitate other elements into a world of fantasmagoric irreality.Dubuffets aggressively anticultural, anti-aesthetic attitude and spontaneity of expression provided an example for members of the COBRA group in Europe, and New York artists such as Claes Oldenburg and Jim Dine.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThroughout the 1940s, while many artists of the nascent New York School were experimenting with Surrealist-inspired biomorphic abstraction, Franz Kline was painting landscapes and portraits. Consequently in 1950, when the artist showed large, gestural abstract paintings in his first solo exhibition, it appeared that he had experienced a wholesale conversion. Much has been made of a 1949 visit he paid to his friend Willem de Kooning, who asked Kline for some of the drawings he always carried in his pockets and projected them onto the wall, monumentalizing details of the sketches. While this episode may have been a catalyst for Klines mature style, by the end of the 1940s his work was already yielding to a looser application of paint and a more emphatic expressionistic technique.Kline scored his success in the early 1950s with large canvases onto which he applied black and white commercial paint with housepainters brushes. He became known as an Action painter because his work expressed movement and energy, emphasizing dynamic line. The characteristic black slashes of Painting No. 7 suggest the full body movement of the artist as he spontaneously applied the paint, incorporating chance splatters and smearing. In fact, Klines paintings were constructed only to look as if they were painted in a moment of inspirationthey usually resulted from the transfer of a sketch to the canvas.Unlike de Kooning and Jackson Pollock, Kline never flirted with figuration in his abstract paintings and avoided spatial ambiguity. Painting No. 7 is among the artists most straightforward statements; it also demonstrates his knowledge of art history. Klines emphasis on the square in this and other works suggests his interest in Josef Albers and Kazimir Malevich. Art historian Harry Gaugh cites Piet Mondrians Composition No. 1: Lozenge with Four Lines (1930) as an influence, and also contends that the compositional structure of Painting No. 7 recalls James McNeill Whistlers Arrangement in Gray and Black, No. 1 (1871). Though the similarity between the latter two paintings might appear incidental, Kline referred to Whistler in other paintings, and the austere geometry of Whistlers canvas would have appealed to him.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

The artist often squeezed paint directly from tubes onto the canvas and emphasized the necessity of rapid application in order to harness an intuitive expression. Mathieu also occasionally introduced a performative dimension to his painting in the 1950s, executing large canvases before audiences.

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe pursuit of new techniques has been a continuous theme of Robert Rauschenbergs work. During a trip to Cuba in spring 1952, the artist first experimented with transfer drawings, taking printed images, primarily from newspapers and magazines, placing them face down on sheets of paper, and then rubbing the backs of the images with an empty ballpoint pen or other burnishing device to transfer the original to the paper. The technique, which Rauschenberg continues to use, has been described as imparting a veiled quality, which the artist heightens by applying paint, pencil, and crayon marks over the transferred images. Yellow Body exemplifies a technical development in which Rauschenberg applied a chemical solvent, such as lighter fluid, to the preprinted image, facilitating a clearer and more complete transfer.Both Untitled (1952) and Yellow Body demonstrate Rauschenbergs concentrated interest in the popular media and his practice of juxtaposing myriad recognizable images. The iconography of these works, which also recalls that of his early silkscreen paintings, includes modes of transportation, astronauts, athletes, and fragments of comic strips. Often an autobiographical reference will be part of this varied mix. Yellow Body includes images of fellow Port Arthur, Texas native Janis Joplin (whom Rauschenberg met in 1968 at the New York nightclub Maxs Kansas City) and Joplins band, Big Brother and the Holding Company.After his move to rustic Captiva Island off the Gulf Coast of Florida in 1970, Rauschenbergs focus shifted from urban and pop culture to an abstract idiom. He adopted unconventional materials, such as cardboard, paper bags, and silk, reflecting his consistently innovative approach to art making. By altering these materials only slightly, the artist emphasized their inherent colors and textures. Rauschenberg transferred newsprint to torn pieces of cheesecloth using an old Fuchs and Lang proofing press, which he had acquired shortly after his arrival in Captiva. The process not only transmitted visual texture but also a physical imprint, shaping the fabric into tail-like lengths to which the artist applied watercolor. For Untitled (1974), Rauschenberg then inserted the fabric between two sheets of paper, leaving the paper unadorned apart from the impression left by the form of the cheesecloth and his signature. The resulting kite is exhibited with only the paper pinned to the wall, allowing the fabric tails to catch the passing breeze.Joan Young\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nOne of the central figures of the New York School, Mark Rothko is best known for his mature idiom, first seen in his paintings of 1949large-scale compositions comprising stacked, hovering rectangular fields of luminous color. Rothko emphatically rejected the reading of his work in merely formal, aesthetic terms, insisting that he was \"not interested in the relationship of color or form or anything else.\" Rather, he used abstract means to express \"basic human emotionstragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on,\" earnestly striving to create an art of awe-inspiring intensity for a secular world. Those viewers who broke down and wept before his paintings, he stated, had \"the same religious experience I had when I painted them.\"1\nThe Guggenheim Museum Bilbao's Untitled (195253) was featured prominently in a 1954 exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, the first solo exhibition of Rothko's mature work in a major American museum. The show comprised eight paintings carefully arranged in a relatively compact and low-ceilinged gallery. Hanging freely from the ceiling near the entrance, Untitled established the prevailing tone, receiving visitors with an inescapable frontality that allowed them no refuge in distance. Scale was an enormously important factor for Rothko: as he explained in a 1951 symposium, he painted on such a large scale not in order to produce something \"grandiose and pompous,\" but rather \"precisely because I want to be intimate and human. To paint a small picture is to place yourself outside your experience, to look upon an experience as a stereopticon view or with a reducing glass. However you paint the larger picture, you are in it. It isn't something you command.\"\nIn the later 1950s and the 1960s Rothko was commissioned to produce several mural ensembles for specific interior spaces: the Four Seasons restaurant in the Seagram Building, New York (a selection of which was ultimately donated to the Tate in London as a \"Rothko Room\"); Harvard University's Holyoke Center; and what became known as the Rothko Chapel in Houston, Texas. Although Untitled is an autonomous work and was not conceived with a particular site in mind, this monumental pieceone of only two paintings from this period on such an immense scalemight be considered among the first of Rothko's true murals. The painting is somewhat unusual in its horizontality, as Rothko tended to prefer a vertical format. Later in his career, several isolated horizontal-format works would appear, but their lateral expansion was not as extreme. Here, experienced at relatively close proximity as the artist intended, the extended format expands beyond the observer's lateral field of vision, so that the painting seems to open itself up and transcend its limits.\n1. Mark Rothko, quoted in Selden Rodman, Conversations with Artists (New York: David-Adair, 1957), pp. 9294; reprinted in Miguel Lopez-Remiro, ed., Writings on Art: Mark Rothko (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006), pp. 11920.\n2. The work that occupied this place in the show has been the subject of some confusion. Exhibition-related materials refer to it as No. 10. David Anfam concludes that it is most likely the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao's work. See David Anfam, Mark Rothko: The Works on Canvas (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998), pp. 72, 100 n. 35 (cat. no. 483).\n3.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the years following the end of World War II, there was a widespread use of expressionist visual language among Western European and American painters working in both abstract and figurative modes. Movements such as Art Informel and Art Brut in Paris and Abstract Expressionism in the United States championed the expressive potential of the painterly gesture and placed a premium on creative spontaneity. The group known as CoBrA, which was founded in 1948 by artists based in Copenhagen, Brussels, and Amsterdam, emerged in this context. Rejecting a formalistic approach to art, CoBrA's members allied themselves with unconventional artistic practices and found inspiration in works by insane artists, in folk art, and, above all, in children's art.\nKarel Appel, Constant (Constant Nieuwenhuys), Corneille (Guillaume Cornelis Beverloo), Christian Dotremont, Asger Jorn, and Joseph Noiret were the founding members of CoBrA. Appel extolled the creative importance of instinct and improvisation, and his work boldly demonstrates the key characteristics of CoBrA art. Never becoming entirely abstract, Appel's expressive painterly style was anchored in principally representational subjectsimaginative animals and fantastic figures. Hoping to recapture the impulse and spontaneity of youth, he sought to achieve a childlike freshness and energy in his work by rendering his subjects in a deliberately awkward, naive fashion, with no attempt at modeling or perspectival illusionism.\nIn 1950 the center of CoBrA activities shifted from the Netherlands to Paris, where Appel and Corneille had relocated. Appel met critic Michel Tapie, a spokesperson for Art Brut, and the artist Jean Dubuffet, whose work Appel greatly admired. Painted after CoBrA disbanded in 1951, Appel's Two Heads (Deux tetes, 1953) reflects, in both subject matter and technique, the dual influence of CoBrA and Art Brut. The vigorous brushstrokes and vibrant hues lend intensity and expressive weight to the disembodied, deformed heads that are vertically stacked, and evocative of totemic images from tribal art. With its thickly painted surface and rough linearity, Two Heads evidences the force of uninhibited expression.\nSuzanne Ramljak\n",

He began to paint there, covering his stretchers with burlap when other materials were unavailable. Upon his return to Italy in 1946 Burri renounced his original profession and dedicated himself to making art.Composition is one of his Sacchi (sacks), a group of collage constructions made from burlap bags mounted on stretchers, which the artist began making in 1949. One of Burris first series employing nontraditional mediums, the Sacchi were initially considered assaults against the established aesthetic canon. His use of the humble bags may be seen as a declaration of the inherent beauty of natural, ephemeral materials, in contradistinction to traditional high art mediums, which are respected for their ostentation and permanence. Early commentators suggested that the patchwork surfaces of the Sacchi metaphorically signified living flesh violated during warfarethe stitching was linked to the artists practice as a physician. Others suggested that the hardships of life in postwar Italy predicated the artists redeployment of the sacks in which relief supplies were sent to the country.Yet Burri maintained that his use of materials was determined purely by the formal demands of his constructions. If I dont have one material, I use another. It is all the same, he said in 1976. I choose to use poor materials to prove that they could still be useful. The poorness of a medium is not a symbol: it is a device for painting. The title Composition emphasizes the artists professed concern with issues of construction, not metaphor. Underlying the work is a rigorous compositional structure that belies the mundane impermanence of his chosen mediums and points to art-historical influences. The Sacchi rely on lessons learned from the Cubist- and Dada-inspired constructions of Kurt Schwitters.Despite Burris cool public stance, the Sacchi are examples of the Expressionism widely practiced in postwar Europe, where such work was called Art Informel (in the U.S. it was called Abstract Expressionism). Artists used powerfully rendered gestures and accommodated chance occurrences to express the existential angst characteristic of the period.Jennifer Blessing\n",

From the early 1950s, his sculpture revealed the importance of the material, as seen in From Within (Desde dentro, March 1953), which exudes a vitality and tension in the bending and joining of iron elements. The curved and pointed shapes of iron bars create a silhouette that changes when seen from different angles.

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlberto Giacometti was 20 years old when he settled in Paris in order to pursue the career of a sculptor. He studied classical sculpture and the predominant Cubist idioms, but it was not until he began to interpret primitive objects that he was able to liberate himself from the influence of his teachers. Spoon Woman, one of the artists first mature works, explores the metaphor employed in ceremonial spoons of the African Dan culture, in which the bowl of the utensil can be equated with a womans womb. But Giacomettis life-size sculpture reverses the equivalence. As the art historian and theorist Rosalind Krauss has noted, By taking the metaphor and inverting it, so that a spoon is like a woman becomes a woman is like a spoon, Giacometti was able to intensify the idea and to make it universal by generalizing the forms of the sometimes rather naturalistic African carvings toward a more prismatic abstraction.Giacometti joined the ranks of the Surrealists in 1929, only to break with them acrimoniously six years later, when he decided to work from models rather than strictly from his imagination. Yet even in Nose there is something of the Surrealist tendency toward the fantastic in the incredible proboscis. In this work, Giacometti suspended a head from a cross bar in a rectangular cage, thus implying that the pendant head could be prodded to swing, the nose further extending beyond the confines of its prison. There is a vague threat in the shape of the head: the configuration of nose, skull, and neck recalls the barrel, chassis, and handle of a gun. However, the wide-open mouth suggests a scream of anguish, and the cord attaching it to its cage evokes the gallows. Nose should be seen within the context of postwar existential angst that was voiced by Jean-Paul Sartre, a friend of the artist.In Diego, a painting of his brother, Giacometti continued in this vein, insinuating the loneliness caused by each individuals isolation within his own existence. Like the head in Nose, the solitary Diego is presented in the confines of a cagelike structure of lines denoting the architecture of the room. The atmosphere of melancholy is further suggested both by the artists muted palette that seems to drain life from the sitter, and the figures near-transparency in a haze of reworked paint.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1925 Miros work took a decisive turn, stimulated, according to the artist, by hunger-induced hallucinations involving his impressions of poetry. These resulted in the artists dream paintings, such as Personage, in which ghostly figures hover in a bluish ether. Miro explored Surrealist automatism in these canvases, attempting to freely transcribe his wandering imagination without preconceived notions. Although these images are highly schematic, they are not without references to real things, as the artist made clear. For me a form is never something abstract, he said in 1948. It is always a sign of something. It is always a man, a bird, or something else. In these works Miro began to develop his own language of enigmatic signs: the forms in Personage depict a large vestigial foot and a head with three teeth in its grinning mouth. The star shape often represents female genitalia in Miros oeuvre, and the dot with four rays symbolizes the vision of a disembodied eye.Two years later Miro reverted to imagery somewhat more grounded in reality. In Landscape (The Hare), among other works, he also returned to one of his favorite subjects, the countryside around his familys home in Catalonia. Miro said that he was inspired to paint this canvas when he saw a hare dart across a field on a summer evening. In Landscape (The Hare), this event has been transformed to emphasize the unfolding of a heavenly event. A primeval terrain of acid oranges and red is the landscape in which a hare with bulging eyes stares transfixed by a spiraling comet.By the late 1940s Miro was making canvases on a much larger scale and with broader markings. Painting of 1953 is more than 6 feet high by 12 feet wide and is characterized by loose, gestural brushstrokes and stained pigments. The calligraphic drawing style and open field of works such as Personage has, in Painting, metamorphosed into bold, energetic lines in a vast, cosmic atmosphere. Yet the star and sun, the animal-like forms, and the sprays of dots are signs of the artists symbolic language developed in the 1920s.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

Within Henry Moores own body of work, Three Standing Figures can be seen in connection with the shelter drawings of the early 1940s, in which the artist explored the psychological interaction of groups, and with the monumental Three Standing Figures of 194749 erected at Battersea Park in London. Classicizing elements of the latter, however remote, endure in the Peggy Guggenheim work. The grouping of three figures, their contrapposto stances, the variety of rhetorical gestures, and the echoes of drapery creases and swags provide visual analogies with ancient sources. Typically, Moore conflates the human figure with the forms of inanimate natural materials such as bone and rock. The perforations through the mass of the sculptured bodies suggest a slow process of erosion by water or wind.At least three preparatory drawings exist for Three Standing Figures, which was cast in bronze from a plaster original in an edition of eight, with one artists proof. A ten-inch maquette preceding it in 1952 was also cast in bronze. Neither of the original plasters survives. Moore used bronze increasingly from the late 1940s; he commented on its greater flexibility in comparison with stone, and its relative strength in withstanding the action of the elements.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe critical debate that surrounded Abstract Expressionism during the late 1940s was embodied in the work of Jackson Pollock. Clement Greenberg, a leading critic and Pollocks champion, professed that each discrete art form should, above all else, aspire to a demonstration of its own intrinsic properties and not encroach on the domains of other art forms. A successful painting, he believed, affirmed its inherent two-dimensionality and aimed toward complete abstraction. At the same time, however, the critic Harold Rosenberg was extolling the subjective quality of art; fervent brushstrokes were construed as expressions of an artists inner self, and the abstract canvas became a gestural theater of private passions. Pollocks artfrom the early, Surrealist-inspired figurative canvases and those invoking primitive archetypes to the later labyrinthine webs of poured paintelicited both readings. Pollocks reluctance to discuss his subject matter and his emphasis on the immediacy of the visual image contributed to shifting and, ultimately, dialectic views of his work.In 1951, at the height of the artists career, Vogue magazine published fashion photographs by Cecil Beaton of models posing in front of Pollocks drip paintings. Although this commercial recognition signaled public acceptanceand was symptomatic of mass cultures inevitable expropriation of the avant-gardePollock continuously questioned the direction and reception of his art. His ambivalence about abstract painting, marked by a fear of being considered merely a decorative artist, was exacerbated, and it was around this time that he reintroduced to his paintings the quasi-figurative elements that he had abandoned when concentrating on the poured canvases. Ocean Greyness, one of Pollocks last great works, depicts several disembodied eyes hidden within the swirling colored fragments that materialize from the dense, scumbled gray ground. When you are painting out of your unconscious, he claimed, figures are bound to emerge. Manifest in this painting is a dynamic tension between representation and abstraction that, finally, constitutes the core of Pollocks multileveled oeuvre.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nDuring the first five years of his career, Robert Rauschenberg engaged in formal approaches that remained constant throughout his practice. These included building up and stripping away elements to create a compositional field and an intense focus on the quality of his materials. The latter is explored in some of the artist's earliest works, including his White Paintings series (1951), in which he applied house paint with a roller to achieve smooth, uninflected surfaces. These square and rectangular panels, presented singly or in multiple groupings, incorporate the surrounding environment by capturing the patterns and reflections of light and shadow, functioning, as John Cage observed, like a clock of the room. These works continued the monochromatic tradition established by Kazimir Malevich's Suprematist Composition: White on White (ca. 1918), reducing painting to its essential qualities in order to represent pure experience. In his black paintings of 1951 to 1953 Rauschenberg continued to work in a multipanel format and with a single color, but added texture to the surfaces by pasting layers of newspaper onto the canvas, either allowing the newsprint to show through or covering it completely with a shroud of black paint.Rauschenberg's subsequent Red Painting (195354) take the additive quality of the black canvases to further expressionistic ends. He commented on his color choice in an interview with art historian Barbara Rose many years later: I was trying to move away from black and white. Black or white, not black-and-white. So I picked the most difficult color for me to work in. These complex surfaces, in which material including news-print, comic strips, fabric, nails, and wood mingle with veils of red color, are further activated by the varied application of paint: drips, splatters, washes, heavy impasto, horizontal strokes, and pigment squeezed directly from the tube. Collage played a significant role in the creation of these works, which Rauschenberg partially framed with unembellished wooden blocks at the top and bottom edges. The fusion of the two-dimensional aspect of painting with the three-dimensionality of sculpture would be taken further in Rauschenberg's Combines, begun in 1954; indeed, the other Red Paintings may be seen as a bridge to these seminal works, which would occupy Rauschenberg for the decade to follow.\n",

In an assault on closed form, she breaks through her heavily worked surfaces to expose the structural armature and hollow spaces within the bodies they describe.In subject matter and style this sculpture recalls both Pablo Picassos Surrealist bullfight imagery of the 1930s and his sculptures of the early 1950s. Richier, who was herself familiar with the bullfight, shared with Picasso an interest in its mythic, archaic implications. In addition, the robust three-dimensionality, raw surfaces, and incorporation of found objects in Tauromachy may constitute a response to works such as Picassos She-Goat of 1950 and Goat Skull and Bottle of 195152. Like Henry Moore during the same year, Richier places her forms in situational relationships. As she wrote: Finally, the sculpture is a place, an entity, a synthesis of movements. I dont know if the Tauromachy evokes the sand, but no form, it seems to me, can be separated from the universe, the elements. It is therefore something more than an image.1This bronze was produced in an edition of ten.Lucy Flint1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nFrom his youth, Pierre Soulages was deeply influenced by Romanesque sculpture and architecturein particular the \"live\" blackness he first encountered during a visit at the age of 12 to the church of Sainte-Foy de Conques, France, which he identified as the source of his decision to become a painteras well as the ancient Gallic stone dolmens that punctuated the land around his childhood home in southern France. Early on he was also drawn to the work of Claude Lorraine and Rembrandt van Rijn, whose rendering of light had an impact on his development. In 1938 he moved to Paris to prepare for the entrance exam to the Ecole nationale superieure des beaux-arts, but he soon abandoned his traditional studies at the school as a result of seeing exhibitions of the work Pablo Picasso and Paul Cezanne and visiting the Louvre.\nIn his earliest work Soulages took leafless winter trees as his point of departure. Their essential, reduced network of brancheswhich Soulages regarded as abstract sculptureprovided him with an ideal vehicle for the exploration of structure and variation. During the German occupation of France he had occasion to meet Sonia Delaunay who introduced him to abstract art and set him on a new path. By the mid 1950s, Soulages had switched from a small brush, with which he had painted abstract calligraphic patterns, to palette knives, straightedges, and large house-painting brushes. These tools afforded him a greater range of motion in his wrist, allowing him to produce bold, dynamic strokes that resulted in a more gestural surface. He roughly applied volumes of predominantly black paint on a white ground in broad, slablike strokes, thereby imparting to his paintings both an architectonic and a sculptural quality.\nThe few oblique lines that link the main vertical and horizontal brushstrokes in works such as Painting, 195 x 130 cm, May 1953 (Peinture, 195 x 130 cm, mai 1953, 1953) unite in a composition that reads as a cross. However, Soulages does not intend for his painting to be understood as either a referential object or a religious symbol; rather, it is to be seen as a geometrical figure, whose structural qualities suggest stability and ascetic spirituality. To accentuate this effect Soulages highlights the cruciform shape of the composition, with rectangular windows of light sharply cut into the white background. By illuminating the painting from behind, he creates an effect similar to the one produced in the dim interiors of large old churches when a ray of light filters through a narrow window and the black hues are deepened, creating a pillar of solidity. Light has always been a central concern in Soulages's art, and his layered, glowing swashes of black paintformally evocative of Rembrandt's approach to chiaroscuroprovide him an effective means of investigating it.\nThough often associated with Art Informel, a term coined by the French critic Michel Tapie in 1952 to describe postwar European art that emphasized improvisation and gesture, Soulages has always opposed this label because he feels that his use of geometry and disdain for intimate emotions in painting run counter to the works by such Art Informel artists as Jean Dubuffet and Henri Michaux. Nonetheless, Soulages repeatedly exhibited with the group. Similarly, while his use of large formats and his belief that the more limited the means the stronger the expression led critics to compare his work with the American Action painters, the comparison falls flat as soon as one considers that his exploration pursues architectonic permanence rather than gestural transience.\n",

With no fantastic element other than the single paradoxical combination of day and night, Rene Magritte upsets a fundamental organizing premise of life. Sunlight, ordinarily the source of clarity, here causes the confusion and unease traditionally associated with darkness. The luminosity of the sky becomes unsettling, making the empty darkness below even more impenetrable than it would seem in a normal context. The bizarre subject is treated in an impersonal, precise style, typical of veristic Surrealist painting and preferred by Magritte since the mid-1920s.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

This emergent shape and the background coalesce into a vigorously brushed surface that is distinguished by thickly impastoed white pigment and a network of predominantly blue lines. There are still traces of the allover patterning that characterizes the artists watercolors and earlier canvases such as The Ant Hill (La fourmiliere, 1954). His work likewise exhibits a fluidity and vitality that points to the artists fascination with Japanese calligraphy, which he observed during his travels to Japan in 1955.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAfter his first exposure to Surrealist collage in 1931, Joseph Cornell began to work in that format, eventually extending it into three-dimensional box structures. Unlike many European Surrealists, however, he was less interested in disturbing the viewer than in evoking enchanted worlds past and those yet to come. Cornell incorporated printed images and found objects into his boxes, which were often conceived in series. Space Object Box: Little Bear, etc. motif is part of the Winter Night Skies series, which includes fragments of celestial maps of the northern sky. The focus of the map fragment in Space Object Box is the constellation Ursa Minorthe Little Bear of the title. The etc. refers to the other personifications of stars that the artist has colored, including Cameleopardalis, the giraffe, and Draco, the dragon. The blue cork ball and the ring suggest the moon and its orbit; their movement along the two metal rods alludes to the unending cycle of celestial change. The toy block with a horse on its face is probably a punning reference to Pegasus, a square constellation.Andromeda appears in a box from the Hotel series, Untitled (Grand Hotel de lObservatoire), which also contains an image of the head of Draco on a small cylinder hanging from a rod along the roof of the box; the cascading chain could refer to the long trail of stars called the Dragons Tail. Mottled royal-blue pigment in the glistening white paint evokes the sparkling of stars in the sky. By incorporating the names of Grand Hotels, cut and pasted like hotel stationery in a scrapbook, Cornell nostalgically recalled the souvenirs of travelers. This box seems to promote the heavens as a place of respite, a view that may reflect the artists education as a Christian Scientist. Mary Baker Eddy, the charismatic founder of the religion, believed that modern scientific theory holds a key to understanding our world. In a book that Cornell called the most important to him after the Bible, she wrote, The astronomer will no longer look up to the starshe will look out from them upon the universe. Cornell, who lived most of his life on Utopia Parkway in Queens, never went to Europe, although his boxes are often filled with tokens of European culture. He could no more visit the 19th-century Old World of his imagination than he could visit the stars, but he could dream about these places and invoke them in his boxes.Jennifer Blessing\r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nFernand Legers use of streamlined forms derived from mechanical imagery dates from World War I, when he served in the French army. His predilection for military hardware and its gleaming surfaces coincided with his feelings of solidarity with the foot soldiers surrounding him in the trenches. The machine aesthetic he adopted at this time reflected his hopes of creating a truly popular art form that would describe and inspire modern life. After the war, he turned away from the experiments with pure abstraction that characterized his earlier work and infused social meaning into his art; quasi-representational motifs emerged in lively paintings depicting soldiers, factory workers, bargemen, and pulsating urban environments. In works such as The City of 1919 and The Mechanic of 1920, Leger incorporated elements of Cubist fragmentation into his new pristine, mechanical syntax to evoke the energy of contemporary experience.As a call to order resounded throughout postwar French society, Leger introduced the monumental, classical figure into his art. The absolute calm and stasis of Woman Holding a Vase demonstrates his affinities with the neo-antique depictions of women by his contemporaries Pablo Picasso and Gino Severini. It also shows Legers sympathies with the Purist ideals of Amedee Ozenfant and Le Corbusier, who called for a revival of classical aesthetic consonance as a symbol of renewed social harmony. Legers palette of blue, yellow, red, and black is indebted to Piet Mondrians concurrent De Stijl paintings, further evincing Legers identification with utopian and reconstructivist ideals of the 1920s and 1930s.The result of over one hundred preparatory studies dating from as early as 1947, The Great Parade is a defining work within the artists oeuvre. The joyful parade motif evolved out of several preceding themes in Legers oeuvreincluding cyclists, country outings, and the circusthat celebrated the leisure activities of the working class. The circus in particular is an accessible arena in which all spectators are equal, brought together in their delight over the clowns, trapeze artists, and animal acts. In this mural-size canvasconceived on a scale appropriate to mass viewingthe interlocking figures perform their inspired feats along a horizontal swathe of blue, which is punctuated by a large red C for cirque. The final version of The Great Parade, painted one year before the artists death, is the culmination of his career-long endeavor to both represent and reach a public beyond the small circle of connoisseurs familiar with fine art.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlthough often cited as the originator of Action Painting, an abstract, purely formal and intuitive means of expression, Willem de Kooning most often worked from observable reality, primarily from figures and the landscape. From 1950 to 1955, de Kooning completed his famous Women series, integrating the human form with the aggressive paint application, bold colors, and sweeping strokes of Abstract Expressionism. These female portraits provoked not only with their vulgar carnality and garish colors, but also because of their embrace of figural representation, a choice deemed regressive by many of de Koonings Abstract Expressionist contemporaries, but one to which he consistently returned for many decades.Composition serves as a bridge between the Women and de Koonings next series of work, classified by critic Thomas Hess as the Abstract Urban Landscapes (195558). According to the artist, the landscape is in the Woman and there is Woman in the landscapes. Indeed, Composition reads as a Woman obfuscated by de Koonings agitated brushwork, clashing colors, and allover composition with no fixed viewpoint. Completed while the artist had a studio in downtown New York, Compositions energized dashes of red, turquoise, and chrome yellow suggest the frenetic pace of city life, without representing any identifiable urban inhabitants or forms.Painted 20 years later, after de Kooning moved to East Hampton, New York, seeking to work in greater peace and isolation, ...Whose Name Was Writ in Water takes nature as its theme. Water was a favorite subject of the artist, and he devised a rapid, slippery technique of broad impasto strokes with frayed edges, speckled with drips, to convey its fluidity and breaking movement. The title, taken from an epigraph on Keatss tomb, which de Kooning had seen on a trip to Rome in 1960, is, according to critic Harold Rosenberg, the closest de Kooning can come to saluting overtly the impermanence of existence, and things in a state of disappearance. Always aiming to reinforce the content of his work with his technique, de Kooning reworked his canvases over and over again, making each painting a composite of evanescent visual traces. The scrambled pictorial vocabulary and condensed space of the urban landscapes was gradually diffused in de Koonings later work. More open compositions, a less cluttered palette, and looser, liquid brushstrokes reveal a painter relieved of the nervous, claustrophobic atmosphere of city life and newly at peace with his rural surroundings.Bridget Alsdorf\r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMoon Cage is, according to the artist, neither abstract nor representational. David Hare has stated that this sculpture is not figurative literally. A combination of images is more interesting to me. Ambiguity is important; a confusion of images makes you more conscious of the image you are interested in. In approaching the work from any side, one encounters the ambiguity described by the artist in the powerful suggestions of a window, a moon, and a human figure.The central configuration, which is literally drawn in space, is created by the union of four steel rods welded about a central rod. This form both supports and is pierced by two framing rectangles that intersect at right angles at its core. These frames are at once windows that open into space and the bars of a cage that enclose. The artist has said of this spatial dualism, you are in a house and would like to get out, or you are out and would like to be in. The piece is contained within a square space defined by the welded pedestal, establishing a dialogue between the closed plane of the base and the open space of the construction above it. The configuration is held aloft by the stem of a crescent-shaped abstract form, which may be the moon referred to by the title. This form rhymes with a smaller crescent at the top of the sculpture, from which an arabesque line falls gracefully and dips into the space below the frame of the cage. This continuous arabesque unites the piece by mediating between the empty space at the base of the work and the complex, elongated structure over it.Hare was an American heir to the Surrealist tradition brought to New York in the early 1940s by European emigre artists. During his stay in Paris between 1948 and 1953, Hare became friends with Alberto Giacometti. In its evocation of a female figure caged within an architectural setting, the present work recalls enigmatic sculptures by Giacometti such as Invisible Object (Hands Holding the Void) of 193435 (Collection Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven). But the elaborate, varied surfaces in Moon Cage link Hare to a generation of American sculptorsamong them Ibram Lassaw, Seymour Lipton, and Theodore Roszakwho experimented with complicated molded, pitted, and encrusted surfaces of welded metal.Elizabeth C.

He was intrigued by the points identity as the determinant sign of location, the smallest indication of presence. Tancredis ideas about infinite space and the use of the point within it were developed by 1951, when he settled in Venice. This work typifies the crowded, architectonic compositions he painted before his visit to Paris in 1955.Incomplete circles vibrant with undiluted pigment radiate from pivotal points and swirl throughout the canvas. These appear below, above, and amid rectangular slabs, the whole comprising a multilayered scaffolding of light and color producing the illusion of extensive, textured depth. Density of form and color increases toward the center of the composition, which consequently appears to bulge forward from the corners, illustrating Tancredis view of space as curved. The vitality of execution and tactile richness reflect the influence of Jackson Pollock. The choppy, animated repetition of color applied with a palette knife resembles that of the French-Canadian painter Jean-Paul Riopelle, with whom Tancredi exhibited in 1954.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

Although the group was short-lived, its concerns have endured in his work. The single standing figures of humans or animals he developed during the 1950s are rendered in a deliberately awkward, naive way, with no attempt at modeling or perspectival illusionism. Thus, the crocodile in this painting is presented as a flat and immobile form, contoured with heavy black lines in the manner of a child's drawing.Appel's paint handling activates a frenzy of rhythmic movement in The Crying Crocodile Tries to Catch the Sun (1956), despite the static monumentality of the subject. Drips and smears are interspersed with veritable stalactites of brilliant, unmodulated color that buckle, ooze, slash, wither, and thread their way over the surface. The physicality of the impasto and its topographic variety allow it to reflect light and cast shadows dramatically, increasing the emotional intensity of violent color contrasts. In 1956 Appel summarized the genesis of his work: \"I never try to make a painting; it is a howl, it is naked, it is like a child, it is a caged tiger. . . .

The immediacy and drama of the event is conveyed through the tactility of the surface. The paint, mixed with sand, is encrusted on the canvas to form a kind of topographic ground evoking plains, ridges, lakes, and peaks.

From 1950 to 1960, Burri executed a series of textile constructions called sacchi (sacks), using paint and sewn or collaged pieces of burlap and fabric. Early commentators suggested that the patchwork surfaces of the sacchi signified living flesh violated during warfare. Burri subsequently became fascinated with burning materials and began to produce wood pieces, or legni, in 1955. As seen here, Burri scorched thin sheets of wood veneer until they had achieved the desired expressive impact and then glued the sheets to canvas.

    "description": "\nDescription\nLiving between Paris and New York, Alexander Calder had increasing contact with the major proponents of the European avant-garde of the 1930s. He moved among the various art-world factions without aligning himself and with little concern for their rivalries. Upon seeing Calder's motorized sculptures in fall 1931, Marcel Duchamp dubbed them mobile, as he had his own motorized work decades earlier. Calder embraced the meanings implied by the French term, both referring to a motive and something movable, even quick and unstable, and used it for those works where elements moved by currents of air. When Jean Arp saw Calder's moveable work in 1932, he coined the term stabile to refer to Calder's static constructions.In the late 1930s, Calder began to favor forms that suggested plants and animals over galactic subjects. Like the Surrealist artists he often exhibited alongside, Calder held an affinity for biomorphic forms and accidental relationships. Calder's mobileswith individual elements that combine and recombine at randomcreate a poetry of the unexpected similar to that of Man Ray's encounter of a sewing machine and an umbrella on a dissecting table or Arp's chance collages, as well as mimic the unpredictable and passing movements of nature. Calder continued to reference the natural world in his nonfigurative work throughout his life, as in the monumental mobile Red Lily Pads. Its ovoid disks float parallel to the earth in fleeting arrangements, like leaves skimming the surface of water.Escaping the tensions of World War II, Calder returned to America where in the 1940s and 1950s he remained apart from the abstract artists of the New York School, preferring the company of emigre artists such as Andre Masson and Yves Tanguy, who like him, made no claims for the underlying meaning or emotional content of abstract expression. Jean-Paul Sartre, brought by Masson to visit Calder's studio in Connecticut in 1946, was attracted to the transitory properties of his mobiles and wrote, Calder establishes a general destiny of motion for each mobile, then he leaves it on its own. It is the time of day, the sun, the heat, the wind which calls each individual dance . . . . One sees the artist's main theme, but the mobile embroiders it with a thousand variations. It is a little swing tune, as unique and ephemeral as the sky or the morning. If you have missed it, you have missed it forever.\n",

The first series was completed in 1939. When Nicholson focused again on the form in the mid-1950s, the reliefs became subtly varied in coloration and texture. The present example is particularly severe, the absence of curved or diagonal lines recalling the work of Piet Mondrian, whom Nicholson knew and admired. The muted, chalky color evokes early Italian Renaissance frescoes and shards of classical pottery.The parenthetical menhir (Breton for long stone) in the title refers to the simple prehistoric stone slabs found throughout western Europe, especially in Brittany. The association is reinforced by the vertical format and the hewn monochromatic surface of the board. The balance of shape, proportion, and placement, apparently so simple, is achieved adroitly. The thickness of the central rectangle decreases gradually from top to bottom, so that the form projects where it meets the upper rectangle, while lying flush above the lower rectangle. This manipulation produces a tapering shadow that softens the strictly perpendicular alignment of the relief to produce a work of austere harmony.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

These works are subtle, quiet, and poeticmore meditative in nature than the energetic gestural abstractions of some of his American-born counterparts. The composition of Decision (1956) is also organized to suggest natural topography. Blocky, softly defined shapes organically arrange the canvas into rough horizontal registers, creating a panoramic quality reminiscent of landscape painting. Meanwhile, small, irregular shapes hover and tumble rhythmically across the stable ground. Okada thus seeks a balance between heavy and delicate, tangible and abstract.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1955, five years after leaving Hungary for Paris where she had been briefly associated with Andre Bretons Surrealist group, Judit Reigl began a new series to explore the process of painting as a dynamic and corporeal activity. The resulting works, collectively titled Outburst (Eclatement, 195557), feature masses of exploded paint that traverse the surface of the canvas tracing the movements of the artists body in action. Painted at the beginning of 1956, Outburst, as the rest of the series, was realized in a single session. Using a stretched canvas, which she tilted against the wall, Reigl worked by hurling a mixture of industrial pigment and linseed oil onto the surface by hand, added a few slabs of extra paint with a long and flexible knife, then broke down the mounds by spreading and flattening them into diagonal bands with a bent curtain rod. The lumps of blue, purple, and white pigment thus transformed into gestural streaks refute the gravitational weight of the material and transcribe the spatial-temporal dimensions of the moving body onto the pictorial plane. \nFirst shown in December 1956 at the Galerie Kleber during Reigls second Parisian solo exhibition, the series expanded on the Surrealist methods of automatism and employed what the artist calls automatic writing lived in its plenitude.1 Departing from the purely interior, psychic model of automatism proposed by Breton, Reigl relied on the immediacy of the gesture and made the pictorial process and the body mutually dependent. Her violent, ephemeral, and amorphous marks substitute the mastery of the painters hand with the contingency of the body, and together with their spacing and chromatic austerity appear to contaminate the radiance of the empty canvas. Although Outburst shares some of the characteristics of the gestural and calligraphic tendencies of 1950s French abstraction, the vehement physicality of Reigls practice suggests closer connections with the works of her American contemporaries, especially with Willem de Kooning and Joan Mitchell. Created by dismantling and reorganizing the shock of the hurled mass of paint as Hubert Damisch put it, Outburst is an aggressive and erotic confrontation between body and canvas, movement and space.\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nPierre Soulages, a leading proponent of Tachisme (from the French word tache, meaning blot or stain), maintained that he decided to become a painter while inside the church of Sainte-Foy in Conques-en-Rouergue, near his birthplace in the South of France. The impressions of monumentality, stability, primitive force, and clearly organized volumes characteristic of the Romanesque style, as well as the mystery and sobriety of dark church interiors, were metaphorically transmitted in his mature style. Early on he was also drawn to the work of Claude Lorraine and Rembrandt van Rijn, whose rendering of light had an impact on his development. In 1938 he moved to Paris to prepare for the entrance exam to the Ecole nationale superieure des beaux-arts, but he soon abandoned his traditional studies at the school as a result of seeing exhibitions of the work of Paul Cezanne and Pablo Picasso and visiting the Louvre.\nIn his earliest work Soulages took leafless winter trees as his point of departure. Their essential, reduced network of brancheswhich Soulages regarded as abstract sculptureprovided him with an ideal vehicle for the exploration of structure and variation. During the German occupation of France, he met Sonia Delaunay, who introduced him to abstract art and set him on a new path. By the mid 1950s, Soulages had switched from a small brush, with which he had painted abstract calligraphic patterns, to palette knives, straightedges, and large house-painting brushes. These tools afforded him a greater range of motion in his wrist, allowing him to produce bold, dynamic strokes that resulted in a more gestural surface. Throughout his career, Soulages painted in a predominately black palette in order to explore the contrasts of light and shade, which endowed his paintings both an architectonic and a sculptural quality. In Painting, November 20, 1956 (Peinture, 20 novembre 1956, 1956), Soulages divided his canvas into three horizontal registers, articulating each with a repetition of slablike black shapes that reveal a variety of red and brown nuances, as well as a certain luminosity.\n",

Their scrawled, half-innocent, half-demonic features also have antecedents in the creatures of Jean Dubuffet and Paul Klee. These presences hovering on the surface of the canvas are integrated with their surroundings, scarcely distinguishable as representational forms. In the present canvas blobs of paint and linear contours coalesce into a standing, grinning human figure at the right and a bird in the center; a multitude of faces, less acutely defined, emerge, vanish, and reappear in the seething environment. Wherever two dots can be interpreted as eyes, a face can be imagined.The sense of fantasy here is complemented by the candied color applied in thicknesses ranging from thin veneer to heavy ridges. Line incises its way through the fluffy space of this layered pigment to determine boundaries and suggest form. The dots of color sprinkled throughout anticipate the pointillism of the artists Luxury Paintings of the early 1960s, in which paint is dripped onto the canvas from a perforated tin can.

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlthough Francis Bacon is best known for his alienated and often hideously distorted human figures, animals are the subject of at least a dozen of his canvases. He rarely worked from nature, preferring photographs, and for images of animals he often consulted Eadweard Muybridge's Animals in Motion (1899), Marius Maxwell's Stalking Big Game with a Camera in Equatorial Africa (1925), and pictures from zoological parks. Intrigued by the disconcerting affinities between simians and human beings, he first compared them in 1949 in Head IV (Man with a Monkey), in which a man's averted face is concealed by that of the monkey he holds.Like his human subjects, Bacon's animals are shown in formal portraits or candid snapshots in which they are passive, shrieking, or twisted in physical contortions. The chimpanzee in the Peggy Guggenheim work is depicted with relative benevolence, though the blurring of the image, reflecting Bacon's interest in frozen motion and the effects of photography and film, makes it difficult to interpret the pose or expression. In composition and treatment it is close to paintings of simians executed in the 1950s by Graham Sutherland, with whom Bacon became friendly in 1946. The faint, schematic framing enabled Bacon to \"see\" the subject better, while the monochrome background provides a starkly contrasting field that helps to define form.Lucy Flint\n",

Intricate and insistent, Capogrossis signs determined the construction of the pictorial surface. Similar to mysterious lists or sequences, his paintings were immediate in their appeal yet remained hard to decode, a quality he shared with other Art Informel practitioners. These abstract comb-sign paintings, known simply as Surfaces (Superficies, 194972), were first exhibited at the Galleria del secolo, Rome, in 1950. The comb sign dominated his oeuvre until the end of his career.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nA grotesque male nude dominates Will to Power, his gritty roughness, burly proportions, inlaid stone teeth, and glass fragments for eyes giving him a fierce and threatening air. But the figures aggressive machismo is itself threatened by the very stance he assumes: hands held behind the back, his gesture is either one of unexpected receptivity or of helpless captivity. The title refers to a central tenet of Nazi ideology, taken from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. But in a single deft stroke, Dubuffets caricature mocks Fascisms claims to authority as it emasculates romanticized male aggression.Dubuffets painting style, which he called Art Brut (raw art), was contrary to everything expected of a painter in the French tradition and dealt a serious blow to the usual aesthetic assumptions. Inspired by graffiti and art made by the mentally ill, Dubuffet insisted that his protest was against specious notions of beauty inherited from the Greeks and cultivated by magazine covers. In Triumph and Glory, the female nudetreated by most artists with venerationreceives no more charitable treatment than her male counterpart in Will to Power. One of 36 female nudes known as the Corps des dames series, she lacks psychological presence and personal identity, and could easily be perceived as an abomination.While the art of primitive cultures and unschooled practitioners was of special importance to Dubuffet, he was also interested in a disparate array of found objects and materials. Door with Couch Grass, an assemblage of several paintings that he cut down and pieced together to represent a wall, doorstep, and the ground, typifies his insatiable interest in found patterns, textures, and materials. The extraordinary range of techniques that Dubuffet employed in this work includes creating successive layers of paint by shaking a brush over the painting and covering it with a spray of tiny droplets, scattering sand over the surface, and scratching it with the tines of a fork. In his attempt to rehabilitate values and materials dismissed by Western aesthetics, what mattered to Dubuffet was unbridled energy, spontaneity, and truth to selfand with them, a spirit of insubordination and impertinence.Jan Avgikos\r\n        ",

Combining his formal and spiritual aspirations as well as an emphasis on mathematics, geometry, and the physical sciences, Oteizas conceptual process was influenced by the hollowed surfaces in the San Andres sculptures. Oteizas constructions, which investigate formal absences and volumes of empty space through the development of what he called his intencion experimental (experimental purpose), arose out of conceptual considerations of spiritual transcendence and the goal of transforming basic materials into derivations of creative energy.\nOteizas experimentation with creating empty but active spatial volumes was accelerated by his reappraisal of works by artists such as Vasily Kandinsky, Kazimir Malevich, and Piet Mondrian, who put into practice the process of emptying simple, geometric forms. Oteiza based this work on a range of attempts carried out on small models ordered in groups that pose the same set of problems, which he referred to as familias experimentales (experimental families) or series. Only the most representative or intense of these models were eventually transferred to a final state and always on a modest scale. Around that time, as part of his Vacating of the Sphere (Desocupacion de la esfera) series, he also produced Hillargia (1957); Empty Construction with Five Curved Malevich Units (Construccion vacia con cinco unidades Malevich curvas, 1957); and Study for the Emptying of the Sphere (Ensayo de desocupacion de la esfera, 1958). The first work is a study of motion from a structural viewpoint that also figuratively refers to the phases of the moon.

    "description": "\nDescription\nGrowing up in the 1930s, Jean Tinguely began building machines with hydraulic wheels that generated sound effects. At the Allgemeine Gewerbeschule Basel, Switzerland, where he intermittently attended art classes from 1941 to 1945, he especially valued his studies with Julia Ris, who helped him discover modern art. Through her course on material studies, based on the methods of the German artist Kurt Schwitters, Ris also opened the young artist's eyes to the potential of nonart materials and encouraged both a sense of play and an exploration of movement that proved central to his mature work.\nTinguely moved to Paris in 1953 and in May 1954 he had his first solo show in the book department of Galerie Arnaud Lefebvre. He exhibited a group of relief works, similar to White Moving Forms on Black Background (TNT), (1957), which looked like black boxes with white geometric shapes spread across their surfaces; they bore a striking resemblance to the paintings of Russian artist Kazimir Malevich and many were retroactively retitled Meta-Malevich (Meta-Malevitch). Upon closer inspection, viewers discovered that not only were the white shapes made from sheet metal and therefore three-dimensional, but they were also set in slow, almost indiscernible motion through a system of wooden wheels linked with a rubber belt and activated by a small motor affixed to the back of the works. In these pieces, described by the Swedish art historian Pontus Hulten as \"meta-mechanical,\" Tinguely engaged mechanical means to move beyond the stasis and permanence of standard paintings, thereby creating works that transformed over the course of time. Tinguely said: \"[I] began to use movement simply to make a re-creation. It was a way of redoing a painting so that it would become infiniteit would go on making new compositions with the help of the physical and mechanical movements I gave it.\"1\nIn 1955 Tinguely, along with Hulten and the American filmmaker Robert Breer, persuaded the prominent Parisian gallerist Denise Rene to mount the historic exhibition Le mouvement (The movement), which included both established (Alexander Calder, Marcel Duchamp, Victor Vasarely) and emerging (Tinguely, Yaacov Agam, Pol Bury, and Jesus Rafael Soto) artists whose work engaged movement as a key element and as a metaphor for change. However, unlike most of his colleagues associated with Kinetic art, Tinguely placed emphasis on making \"anti-machines\" that intentionally failed to function, their self-destruction producing sometimes humorous, sometimes frightening, and always unpredictable results. For him, the machine allowed him to engage the dynamism and poetry of life itself.\r\n\r\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nWilliam Baziotes's paintings are freely improvised, intuitive affairs created in the spirit of Surrealist automatism. Each canvas, he claimed in 1947, \"has its own way of evolving. . . . Each beginning suggests something. . . . The suggestion then becomes a phantom that must be caught and made real.\"1 For Baziotes, the \"reality\" he aspired to exists only in a poetic realm, one in which color and form serve as analogues for psychological and emotional states. This use of visual metaphor was inspired by the artist's love for poetry, particularly that of Charles Baudelaire, whose theory of \"correspondences\" proclaimed the fundamental equivalence of all things in nature and the capacity of any designated thing to symbolize something beyond itself. By the late 1940s Baziotes achieved his signature formal motifdelicate, semitranslucent, biomorphic shapes suspended within aqueous fields of muted colorwhich invokes the Baudelairian world of allusion and association. \"The emphasis on flora, fauna and beings,\" explained the artist about his painting, \"brings forth those strange memories and psychic feelings that mystify and fascinate all of us.\"2Baziotes shared his keen interest in nature with other artists of the New York School, who were motivated simultaneously by their search for primordial truths and their fascination with scientific inquiry. What bridged these two utopian investigations was the microscope; the invisible world of protean forms it revealed promised to disclose the origins of life. This preoccupation with identifying metaphysical features of the organic realm may illuminate Baziotes's predilection for marine imagery, as demonstrated in Aquatic (1961), a painting of serpentine forms swimming through a calm, watery world. The symbolic possibilities of the ocean are vast and Baziotes drew on many of its meanings. Aquatic has been interpreted as an expression of the artist's romantic vision of the sea as a domain of symbiotic relationships. The artist was captivated by the mating practice of eels, which swim through the ocean, rarely touching but always together. The delicately intertwined lines in the picture have been thought to represent these faithful eels on their course through the watery depths.

    "description": "\nDescription\nFollowing his military service as a combat artist, where he was entrusted with rendering images of both daily army life and the destruction wrought by war, James Brooks returned to New York and fully embraced postwar abstraction. Experimenting with the medium of painting, Brooks often exploited the accidents that occurred as an artwork was created. Brooks also frequently combined calligraphic forms and abstract shapes, as seen in Dolamen (1958), where he contrasted black with white, and added accents of pale blue and a bold red horizontal. The strong color and jagged, weighty shapes make the canvas appear larger than it is. Beginning in 1954, Brooks assigned titles to his pictures in an alphabetical sequence based on the order in which he completed them. Thus, Dolamen was the fourth Brooks painted in 1958. To the initial letter, Brooks randomly added syllables, often inventing a word or using a seldom used, unfamiliar one with the intention of not leading the spectator to expect a certain feeling from the work.1\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nWillem de Kooning, like Jackson Pollock and Robert Motherwell, was a leader in the development of Abstract Expressionism, an American movement strongly influenced by European Surrealist notions of automatism and free expression. De Kooning did not use preliminary studies but painted directly on the support, manipulating pigment in vigorous, uninhibited gestures, expressing his subjective apprehensions of the material world in both figurative and abstract compositions. During the late fifties he temporarily abandoned the depiction of the human figure, which had preoccupied him since the beginning of his career, to evoke parkway and urban landscapes in abstract terms. As he wrote: The pictures done since the Women, theyre emotions, most of them. Most of them are landscapes and highways and sensations of that, outside the city, or coming from it.1 The quality of light and the freshness of color in the present painting communicate a sense of landscape. Nevertheless, the subject relates, however indirectly, to the artists obsession with the image of woman, whose contours he has sublimated in abstract natural forms; it is present here in the flesh tones and the lithe curves playing against an implied grid.In the late fifties de Kooning reduced the frenzied proliferation of stroke, form, and plane that had characterized his preceding work to effect compositions of relative restraint and clarity. Each area of color, contoured only by the physical edges of the paint, is applied expansively. The broad simplification makes conspicuous the manner of paint application and the resultant textural complexities of the medium. Movement, conflict, and resolution take place on the flat surface of the canvas, while shifting penetrations into an illusory depth are made by color areas that advance and recede according to value, overlap, or shading.Lucy Flint1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1943 Robert Motherwell and Jackson Pollock experimented with collage in response to Peggy Guggenheim's initial preparations for a show of works in the medium at her gallery Art of This Century. Though Pollock's interest in the technique soon waned, Motherwell's concern with it endured. Personage (Autoportrait) was one of several important examples Motherwell produced in 1943 and 1944. Motherwell acknowledged that the work might evoke an embodiment of self-image. Although a blocky, somewhat mournful figure can be imagined, Personage (Autoportrait) is more readily perceived as a nonspecific coloristic and spatial construction. The energy of handling and the uneven oval shapes separated by a black line foreshadow the powerful facture and recurrent motifs of Motherwell's later work.Motherwell was only twenty-one years old when the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, but its atrocities made an indelible impression on him, and he later devoted a series of more than two hundred paintings to the theme. He conceived of his Elegies to the Spanish Republic as commemorations of human suffering and as abstract, poetic symbols for the inexorable cycle of life and death. Motherwell's allusion to human mortality through a nonreferential visual language demonstrates his admiration for French Symbolism, an appreciation he shared with his fellow Abstract Expressionist painters. The abstract motif common to most of the Elegiesan alternating pattern of bulbous shapes compressed between columnar formsmay be read as an indirect, open-ended reference to the experience of loss and the heroics of stoic resistance. The dialectical nature of life itself is expressed through the stark juxtaposition of black against white.Many of his works, such as those in the Iberia series begun in 1958, are almost entirely black. About the Elegies, Motherwell said, After a period of painting them, I discovered Black as one of my subjectsand with black, the contrasting white, a sense of life and death which to me is quite Spanish. They are essentially the Spanish black of death contrasted with the dazzle of a Matisse-like sunlight. This and other remarks Motherwell made regarding the evolution of the Elegies indicate that form preceded iconography. Given that the Elegies date from an ink sketch made in 1948 to accompany a poem by Harold Rosenberg that was unrelated to the Spanish Civil War, and that their compositional syntax became increasingly intense, it seems all the more apparent that the meaning of each work in the series is subjective and evolves over time.\n",

His development of a non-objective mode of expression for his perceptions of nature was influenced by American abstract art, particularly after his visit in 1957 to New York, where he met Willem de Kooning, Hans Hofmann, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, Barnett Newman, and Mark Rothko. Santomaso uses nature as a visual pretext (to employ his own term), absorbing it and changing it into pictorial form; the resultant painting derives its impact not from the imitation of nature, but from the tension between art and nature. Life can be imparted to abstract form only through its disposition in an abstract order. Santomaso refers to the eyes exploratory adventure as it perceives the secret combination of things in nature and their fantastic equivalent in painting.1 The title of this work alludes to the encounter of life and art, and draws attention to the hint of a centralized human figure, the structural features of which appear and disappear, easily mistaken for the random patterns seen on a peeling Venetian wall.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the years after World War II, both Europe and America saw the rise of predominantly abstract painting concerned with materials and the expression of gesture and marking. New Yorkers dubbed the development in the United States Abstract Expressionism, while the French named the pan-European phenomenon of gestural painting Art Informel. A variety of the latter was Tachisme, from the French word tache, meaning blot or stain. Antoni Tapies was among the artists to receive the label Tachiste because of the rich texture and pooled color that seemed to occur accidentally on his canvases.\nTapies reevaluated humble materials, things of the earth such as sandwhich he used in Great Painting (Gran pintura, 1958)and straw as well as the refuse of humanity such as string and bits of fabric. By calling attention to this seemingly inconsequential matter, he suggested that beauty can be found in unlikely places. Tapies saw his works as objects of meditation that every viewer will interpret according to personal experience; he sought to inspire a contemplative reaction to reality through the integration of materials unexpected in fine art.\nThese images often resemble walls that have been scuffed and marred by human intervention and the passage of time. In Great Painting, an ocher skin appears to hang off the surface of the canvas; violence is suggested by the gouge and puncture marks in the dense stratum. These markings recall the scribbling of graffiti, perhaps referring to the public walls covered with slogans and images of protest that the artist saw as a youth in Cataloniaa region in Spain that experienced the harshest repression under dictator Francisco Franco.

Rather than planning out her richly textured compositions in advance, she often began by laying down lines and allowing the work to evolve as she progressed, much like the Surrealists.

    "description": "\nDescription\nAsger Jorns career began in 1936 when he ventured from Copenhagen to Paris with the goal of apprenticing under the legendary painter Vasily Kandinsky. On his arrival, however, Jorn promptly learned that Kandinsky did not operate his own academy. Instead, the young artist enrolled in Fernand Legers Academie contemporaine and worked with Le Corbusier on his Pavillon des temps nouveaux at the World Exhibition of 1937, experiencing firsthand the formal restraint and balance that characterized the art and architecture of Le Corbusiers Purisma movement dedicated to highly rationalized geometric forms.\nBut Jorn preferred methods rooted in spontaneity and would ultimately reject the techniques of his teachers in favor of a life of art, writing, and activism that amounted to an assault on rationality in all its guisespainterly, architectural, and social. In 1948 Jorn and others, including Karel Appel, founded Cobra, an international collection of like-minded experimental artists. Indebted to the style of Jorns friend Jean Dubuffetwhose Art Brut looked to traditions of art making commonly considered debased or vulgar by the art establishmentCobra art combined Surrealist automatism with the materiality of gestural mark making. Many of Jorns early paintings exist on the boundary between abstraction and figuration, aligning his practice with that of American contemporaries including Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock.\nIn 1957 Jorn merged his anti-Bauhaus group, the Mouvement internationale pour un Bauhaus imaginiste (International movement for an imaginist Bauhaus, founded in 1954), with Guy Debords Lettrist International, to form the Internationale Situationiste (Situationist International, SI), a Marxist, activist group of writers, artists, and theorists who sought to destabilize societal practices and structures ranging from urban planning to the art establishment. Jorn continued to exhibit an anarchic spirit even after he left the SI in 1961. As an act of rebellion against the concept of art prizes, for instance, he refused to accept the Guggenheim Museums 1964 International Award for his painting Dead Drunk Danes (Dddrukne Danskere, 1960), stating in a telegram that he wanted no part of the museums ridiculous game. \nDuring his SI period Jorn focused great effort on a series of modification paintings, which utilized other paintings as pre-existing supports on which to produce new images or marks, but he also continued to work within his Cobra aesthetic, making paintings such as A Soul for Sale (Ausverkauf einer Seele, 195859). In both its use of expressive brushwork and its collapsing of foreground and background, figuration and abstraction, A Soul for Sale articulates some of Jorns most significant interrogations of the precepts of geometric abstraction and rationalized art making. Barely discernible amid a field of gestural marks, the works central figuredemarcated by fragmented contour lines that seem to merge with the abstract ground even as they define the figures formappears on the verge of disappearing. Jorn seems to deny his subject even as he represents it. In a similar fashion, rational strategies of delineating form or representing depth, seen in the contour drawing or in the crosshatching at the top right of the painting, are overcome by strikingly crude or naive methods of mark making, such as scattered soil or paint smudgestechniques Jorn first developed early on as a Cobra artist.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn his brief career, cut short by his untimely death at the age of 30, Piero Manzoni produced a diverse body of work ranging from white, monochromatic paintings known as Achromes, to tubes containing paper marked only with a line, cans of his own excrement, and human bodies signed by the artist in order to indicate their status as art. Importantly, Manzoni helped to bring together like-minded artists working throughout Europe in the late 1950s and early 1960s via his travels, exhibitionsincluding those at the short-lived Galleria Azimut in Milan, which he cofounded with the Italian artist Enrico Castellaniand his magnetic personality. Through such vehicles as his and Castellani's journal Azimuth (two issues, 195960), Manzoni led a charge to reject Art Informel's subjectivity and emphasis on gesture, and to develop instead a \"New Artistic Conception\" that stressed the purity and simplicity of the artistic act.\nIn 1956 Manzoni's work consisted of blotlike representations of anthropomorphic, totemic figures and paintings covered in tar and imprinted with everyday objects such as buttons and keys dipped in paint. His emphasis on facture and the method of automatism reflected formal affinities with Art Informel artists such as Alberto Burri. Manzoni's visit to Yves Klein's 1957 show at the Galleria Apollinaire in Milan, Proposte monochrome, epoca blu (Monochrome proposition, blue period)a display of 11 virtually identical monochrome blue paintingshad a major impact on the direction of his art, as these pictures suggested the potential for creating work that was tautological and self-enclosed, not merely a record of the existential outpouring of the artist.\nSubsequent to his encounter with Klein's work, Manzoni began a series of all-white works that he called Achromes. He did not conceive them as white paintings but rather as acts of negationblank, neutral surfaces stripped of all representation, metaphor, and allusion. After briefly experimenting with scratched and marked gesso surfaces, he developed a novel process of dipping canvas in liquid kaolin (white china clay) and allowing it to dry in wrinkled formations. Works such as Achrome (195859) exemplify this technique that allowed Manzoni to eliminate brushstrokes altogether and thereby to remove his personal imprint from the object. The fact that the work was completed through the drying processin which the artist had no direct rolegreatly appealed to him.\nIn later works in the series, Manzoni would adopt other materials, including stitched squares of canvas, cotton, bread rolls dipped in kaolin, and fiberglass. Despite his use of such everyday materials, he aspired to an art freed of external references.\n",

As a teacher, his influence in this country was enormous and can be detected in the works of a diverse range of artists, including Peter Halley, Donald Judd, and Robert Rauschenberg.\nImpossibles (1931) dates from Albers's years at the Bauhaus and represents his experiments with nontraditional materials and techniques. The mechanical means of producing such glass pieces allowed him to achieve the discipline and detachment that he considered necessary to create nonrepresentational forms. Like other artists of his generation, Albers moved from a figurative style of picture making to geometrically based abstraction. Homage to the Square: Apparition, painted in 1959, is a disarmingly simple work, composed of four superimposed squares of oil color applied with a palette knife directly from the tube onto a white, primed Masonite panel. It is part of a series that Albers began in 1950 and that occupied him for 25 years. The series is defined by an unmitigating adherence to one pictorial formula: the square. The optical effects Albers createdshimmering color contrasts and the illusion of receding and advancing planeswere meant not so much to deceive the eye as to challenge the viewer's faculties of visual reception. This shift in emphasis from perception willed by the artist to reception engineered by the viewer is the philosophical root of the Homage to the Square series. Albers tried to teach the mechanics of vision and show even the uninformed viewer how to see. He was always proud that many nonart students took his classes at Yale. The Homage to the Square series is also distinguished by the carefully recorded inscriptions of technical details on the back of each panel. This codification of the making of the painting, along with the reductively systematic application of colors, anticipated much of the art of the mid-1960s, when painting was stripped of the transcendental, and (in the case of Conceptual art) the paint was often left out altogether.Cornelia Lauf\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nLucio Fontanas respect for the advancements of science and technology during the 20th century led him to approach his art as a series of investigations into a wide variety of mediums and methods. As a sculptor, he experimented with stone, metals, ceramics, and neon; as a painter he attempted to transcend the confines of the two-dimensional surface. In a series of manifestos originating with the Manifesto blanco (White manifesto, 1946), Fontana announced his goals for a spatialist art, one that could engage technology to achieve an expression of the fourth dimension. He wanted to meld the categories of architecture, sculpture, and painting to create a groundbreaking new aesthetic idiom.\nFrom 1947 on, Fontanas experiments were often entitled Concetti spaziali (Spatial concepts), among which a progression of categories unfolds. The artists polychrome sculptures brought color, considered to be under the dominion of painting, into the realm of the three-dimensional. In his buchi (holes) cycle, begun in 1949, he punctured the surface of his canvases, breaking the membrane of two-dimensionality in order to highlight the space behind the picture. With his pietre (stones) series, begun in 1952, he fused the sculptural with painting by encrusting the surfaces of his canvases with heavy impasto and colored glass. From 1958, Fontana purified his paintings by creating matte, monochrome surfaces, thus focusing the viewers attention on the slices that rend the skin of the canvas. Paintings such as Concetto spaziale, Attese (Spatial concept, waiting, 1959) are among these Tagli (cuts, 195868), whose violent jags enforce the idea that the painting is an object, not solely a surface.\nMany of Fontanas proclamations echo Futurist declarations made before World War I. The artists wish that his materials be integrated with space, his need to express movement through gesture, and his interest in states of being (exemplified in his use of the word waiting in the title of this work), suggest the artists familiarity with the work of Umberto Boccioni, a leading Futurist sculptor, painter, and theorist whom Fontana cited as an inspiration.\nJennifer Blessing\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nYves Kleins first passion in life was judo. In 1952 he moved to Tokyo and studied at the Kodokan Judo Institute, where he earned a black belt. When he returned to Paris in 1955 and discovered to his dismay that the Federation Francaise de Judo did not extol him as a star, he shifted his attentions and pursued a secondary interesta career in the arts. During the ensuing eight years Klein assembled a multifarious and critically complex body of work ranging from monochrome canvases and wall reliefs to paintings made with fire. He is renowned for his almost exclusive use of a strikingly resonant, powdery ultramarine pigment, which he patented under the name International Klein Blue, claiming that it represented the physical manifestation of cosmic energy that, otherwise invisible, floats freely in the air. In addition to monochrome paintings, Klein applied this pigment to sponges, which he attached to canvases as relief elements or positioned on wire stands to create biomorphic or anthropomorphic sculptures. First exhibited in Paris in 1959, the sponge sculpturesall essentially alike, yet ultimately all differentformed a forest of discrete objects surrounding the gallery visitors. About these works Klein explained, Thanks to the spongesraw living matterI was going to be able to make portraits of the observers of my monochromes, who . . . after having voyaged in the blue of my pictures, return totally impregnated in sensibility, as are the sponges.1Kleins activities also included using nude female models drenched in paint as brushes; releasing thousands of blue balloons into the sky; and exhibiting an empty, white-walled room and then selling portions of the interior air, which he called zones of immaterial pictorial sensibility. His intentions remain perplexing 30 years after his sudden death. Whether Klein truly believed in the mystical capacity of the artist to capture cosmic particles in paint and to create aesthetic experiences out of thin air and then apportion them at whim is difficult to determine. The argument has also been made that he was essentially a parodist who mocked the metaphysical inclinations of many modern painters, while making a travesty of the art market.Nancy Spector1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1953 Morris Louis visited the studio of Helen Frankenthaler, where he saw Mountains and Sea (1952), the first painting made with her signature soak-stain technique. This method of collapsing color into canvas by manipulating thinned acrylic washes into the unprimed cotton fabric had an immediate impact on Louis, who would translate it into his own idiom in a series of poured paintings created by gravity-pulled streams of luminescent color. These works, which he referred to as Veils, established Louiss mature style and aligned his work with that of other Color Field painters, such as Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, and Clyfford Still at a moment when, for the first time since Impressionism, pure opticality held primacy over content and form.The Veils cannot be traced to an objective referent, and it is this removal of any concrete figural source that allowed Louis to concentrate entirely on the visual. By handling paint as a dye that penetrates the fibers of the canvas rather than as a topical layer brushed over it, he made figure and ground one and the same, uniting them through color. Furthermore, his pouring technique eliminated the gestural stroke that had been central to Abstract Expressionism, as in Jackson Pollocks signature drip or Willem de Koonings frenetic brushwork, allowing the velvety saturated canvas to radiate color in uninflected expanses paced only by the chromatic rhythm of vertical bands.Some debate has surrounded the orientation of Louiss Veils, and this is true of the Guggenheim work in particular. Most of the Veils are hung in accordance with the way Louis made them, with a blank margin above where the pigment began its course down the canvas. According to critic Clement Greenberg, however, the artist was willing to experiment with inverted hangings and was loath to prescribe a particular orientation to a picture by signing it. Sarabands lengths of color, poured from the top as well as from the sides of the canvas, have been flipped on end, moving the pools of collected pigment to the top of the painting and reversing the gravitational flow. A faint, tentative signature in the bottom left corner of the painting has always served to guide its upside-down hanging, although several of Louiss closest contacts believe he preferred it the other way and was encouraged to sign it to support the preference of curator William Rubin, who owned the painting at the time it was first exhibited in 1960.Bridget Alsdorf\r\n        ",

Raised on the plains of Western Canada, Martin developed core principlesself-reliance, pragmatism, humility, and egalitarianismearly on that would underlie her spare artistic style. Indeed, many critics have written about the influence of Martin's native landscape on her flat painted backgrounds. In 1957, she moved to New York, where she became part of a tight-knit group of artistsincluding Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenbergwho reacted against the grand, self-referential gestures of Abstract Expressionism. Martin's pared-down visual language combined drawing and painting techniques with simple geometric shapes. Untitled is the earliest work by the artist to enter the Guggenheim's collection. Dating from 1959, a pivotal year in which Martin began formal experiments that would lead to her iconic grid paintings, it is comprised of four vertical rectangles drawn in graphite across a pale pink-white ground. The freely drawn pencil lines display the hand of the artist and introduce an element of craft into the work. Like the related pieces White Flower and Little Sister (both 1962) already in the museum's collection, Untitled invites viewers to meditate on its elemental beauty.Robin Kaye Goodman\n",

Yet he was of Japanese origin, and as he slowly came in touch with his own cultural roots he increasingly shifted his emphasis away from a formal aesthetic vocabulary founded on the works of sculptors such as Constantin Brancusi in favor of a uniquely Japanese appreciation for the innate beauty of even the simplest materials. His art reveals both a debt to 20th-century sculptural canons and a rare understanding of the means by which geological and organic materials can be transformed. He once remarked, Abandoned stones which I become interested in invite me to enter into their lifes purpose. It is my task to define and make visible the intent of their being.Carl Andre made a similar transition to a Zen-like Minimalism. Yet the works of the two artists are entirely different, perhaps because Noguchi belonged to the previous generation, for which, as he said, sculpture comes from time-consuming difficulty, not industrial reproduction. This existentialist emphasis on the mastery of lifes circumstances characterizes his early sets for the dances of Martha Graham and such sculptures as The Cry and Lunar. The Lunar series came about in the 1940s, when Noguchi became fascinated by the reflection of light on form. Lunar is cut out of anodized aluminum and mounted, in contrast, on a wooden base. The aluminum is a softly reflective surface, sensitive to variations in light. The Cry, on the other hand, is malleable as a result of another natural forcewind. It was made in 1959 out of balsa wood, although it was cast in bronze a few years later. The Guggenheim Museum owns the balsa original, in which Noguchi attempted to create the lightest possible form of solid sculpture. Its elements are loosely connected so that they vibrate in response to air currents. Many of the qualities explored in The Cry and Lunar are also found in Noguchis akari, the ethereal lamps for which he has become best known. Patterned on the paper lanterns hanging outside of traditional homes in Japan, the akari continued Noguchis earlier interest in the potential luminosity and weightlessness of sculpture.Cornelia Lauf\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAfter his first exposure to Surrealist collage in 1931, Joseph Cornell began to work in that format, eventually extending it into three-dimensional box structures. Unlike many European Surrealists, however, he was less interested in disturbing the viewer than in evoking enchanted worlds past and yet to come. Cornell incorporated printed images and found objects into his boxes, which were often conceived in series. Space Object Box: Little Bear, etc. motif is part of the Winter Night Skies series, which includes fragments of celestial maps of the northern sky. The focus of the map fragment in Space Object Box is the constellation Ursa Minorthe Little Bear of the title. The etc. refers to the other personifications of stars that the artist has colored, including Cameleopardalis, the giraffe, and Draco, the dragon. The blue cork ball and the ring suggest the moon and its orbit; their movement along the two metal rods alludes to the unending cycle of celestial change. The toy block with a horse on its face is probably a punning reference to Pegasus, a square constellation.Andromeda appears in a box from the Hotel series, Untitled (Grand Hotel de lObservatoire), which also contains an image of the head of Draco on a small cylinder hanging from a rod along the roof of the box; the cascading chain could refer to the long trail of stars called the Dragons Tail. Mottled royal-blue pigment in the glistening white paint evokes the sparkling of stars in the sky. By incorporating the names of Grand Hotels, cut and pasted like hotel stationery in a scrapbook, Cornell nostalgically recalled the souvenirs of travelers. This box seems to promote the heavens as a place of respite, a view that may reflect the artists education as a Christian Scientist. Mary Baker Eddy, the charismatic founder of the religion, believed that modern scientific theory holds a key to understanding our world. In a book that Cornell called the most important to him after the Bible, she wrote, The astronomer will no longer look up to the starshe will look out from them upon the universe. Cornell, who lived most of his life on Utopia Parkway in Queens, never went to Europe, although his boxes are often filled with tokens of European culture. He could no more visit the 19th-century Old World of his imagination than he could visit the stars, but he could dream about these places and invoke them in his boxes.Jennifer Blessing\r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nHans Hofmanns life affirms the importance of art as an essential activity of society. Providing leadership by teachers and support of developing artists is a national duty, an insurance of spiritual solidarity, wrote Hofmann in 1931. What we do for art, we do for ourselves and for our children and the future.1\nHofmanns greatness lay in the consistency and uncompromising rigor of the artistic standards he devised and his aptitude for teaching those principles to a devoted and diverse body of students. Hofmann founded and taught at art schools from 1915 until 1958, and he inspired a wide range of artists, from Lee Krasner and Burgoyne Diller to Irene Rice Pereira. He is best remembered for teaching the fundamental issues of postwar abstraction: the employment of color and nonrepresentational forms, and the artists ability to weave sophisticated relationships between them. For many of Hofmanns students, this search consisted solely of formal innovation. Hofmanns own work as a painter does not center on original discoveries; rather, it is a glowing synthesis of other movements such as Expressionism and De Stijl. This forces us to reexamine the definition of artistic invention and question the assumption that art must be seen in terms of discrete meaningful objects. In Hofmanns case, art might better be judged as a model from which to teach.\nThe Gate was painted in 195960 as part of a series of works loosely devoted to architectonic volumes. Hofmann used rectangles of color to reinforce the shape of his essentially unvarying easel-painting format. Although The Gate is subjectless, Hofmann insisted that, even in abstraction, students should always work from nature in some form. With determination, a viewer can see that the complex spatial relationship established by the floating planes of color begins to resemble the gate of the title.\nCornelia Lauf\n1.

When he returned to Paris in 1955 and discovered to his dismay that the Federation Francaise de Judo did not extol him as a star, he shifted his attentions and pursued a secondary interesta career in the arts. During the ensuing seven years Klein assembled a multifarious and critically complex body of work ranging from monochrome canvases and wall reliefs to paintings made with fire. He is renowned for his almost exclusive use of a strikingly resonant, powdery ultramarine pigment, which he patented under the name International Klein Blue, claiming that it represented the physical manifestation of cosmic energy that, otherwise invisible, floats freely in the air. In addition to monochrome paintings, Klein applied this pigment to sponges, which he attached to canvases as relief elements or positioned on wire stands to create biomorphic or anthropomorphic sculptures. First exhibited in Paris in 1959, the sponge sculpturesall essentially alike, yet ultimately all differentformed a forest of discrete objects surrounding the gallery visitors. About these works Klein explained, Thanks to the spongesraw living matterI was going to be able to make portraits of the observers of my monochromes, who . . . after having voyaged in the blue of my pictures, return totally impregnated in sensibility, as are the sponges.1For his Anthropometries series, Klein famously used nude female models drenched in paint as brushes. His system of pressing bodies against the paper support (which was later mounted on canvas) rejected any illusion of a third dimension in the pictorial space. In these works, the subject, object, and medium become confused with one another to produce a trace of the body's presence. Klein's unconventional activities also included releasing thousands of blue balloons into the sky, and exhibiting an empty, white-walled room and then selling portions of the interior air, which he called zones of immaterial pictorial sensibility. His intentions remain perplexing thirty years after his sudden death. Whether Klein truly believed in the mystical capacity of the artist to capture cosmic particles in paint and to create aesthetic experiences out of thin air and then apportion them at whim is difficult to determine. The argument has also been made that he was essentially a parodist who mocked the metaphysical inclinations of many modern painters, while making a travesty of the art market.Nancy Spector1.

The arrangement of elements in this mysterious grouping suggests a natural site, like a forest clearing in which the stag (represented by an ironing board resting on wooden \"legs\"), the excremental forms of the \"primordial animals\" (actually made by plunging tools into piles of clay), and a goat (the hapless three-wheeled cart) are illuminated by a powerful lightning bolt (the weighty triangular form that hangs precariously from a beam). The artist is the human witness to this mythic, symbolic narrative (dominated, as always in Beuys's work, by animals), appearing obliquely in the form of the cast block of earth atop an old sculptor's modeling base. Completed in 1985 (the year of the artist's death), this important work was acquired by the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in 2001 and re-presented in a new installation in February 2002.Meghan Dailey\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAfter his first exposure to Surrealist collage in 1931, Joseph Cornell began to work in that format, eventually extending it into three-dimensional box structures. Unlike many European Surrealists, however, he was less interested in disturbing the viewer than in evoking enchanted worlds past and yet to come. Cornell incorporated printed images and found objects into his boxes, which were often conceived in series. Space Object Box: Little Bear, etc. motif is part of the Winter Night Skies series, which includes fragments of celestial maps of the northern sky. The focus of the map fragment in Space Object Box is the constellation Ursa Minorthe Little Bear of the title. The etc. refers to the other personifications of stars that the artist has colored, including Cameleopardalis, the giraffe, and Draco, the dragon. The blue cork ball and the ring suggest the moon and its orbit; their movement along the two metal rods alludes to the unending cycle of celestial change. The toy block with a horse on its face is probably a punning reference to Pegasus, a square constellation.Andromeda appears in a box from the Hotel series, Untitled (Grand Hotel de lObservatoire), which also contains an image of the head of Draco on a small cylinder hanging from a rod along the roof of the box; the cascading chain could refer to the long trail of stars called the Dragons Tail. Mottled royal-blue pigment in the glistening white paint evokes the sparkling of stars in the sky. By incorporating the names of Grand Hotels, cut and pasted like hotel stationery in a scrapbook, Cornell nostalgically recalled the souvenirs of travelers. This box seems to promote the heavens as a place of respite, a view that may reflect the artists education as a Christian Scientist. Mary Baker Eddy, the charismatic founder of the religion, believed that modern scientific theory holds a key to understanding our world. In a book that Cornell called the most important to him after the Bible, she wrote, The astronomer will no longer look up to the starshe will look out from them upon the universe. Cornell, who lived most of his life on Utopia Parkway in Queens, never went to Europe, although his boxes are often filled with tokens of European culture. He could no more visit the 19th-century Old World of his imagination than he could visit the stars, but he could dream about these places and invoke them in his boxes.Jennifer Blessing\r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nHans Hofmanns life affirms the importance of art as an essential activity of society. Providing leadership by teachers and support of developing artists is a national duty, an insurance of spiritual solidarity, wrote Hofmann in 1931. What we do for art, we do for ourselves and for our children and the future.1\nHofmanns greatness lay in the consistency and uncompromising rigor of the artistic standards he devised and his aptitude for teaching those principles to a devoted and diverse body of students. Hofmann founded and taught at art schools from 1915 until 1958, and he inspired a wide range of artists, from Lee Krasner and Burgoyne Diller to Irene Rice Pereira. He is best remembered for teaching the fundamental issues of postwar abstraction: the employment of color and nonrepresentational forms, and the artists ability to weave sophisticated relationships between them. For many of Hofmanns students, this search consisted solely of formal innovation. Hofmanns own work as a painter does not center on original discoveries; rather, it is a glowing synthesis of other movements such as Expressionism and De Stijl. This forces us to reexamine the definition of artistic invention and question the assumption that art must be seen in terms of discrete meaningful objects. In Hofmanns case, art might better be judged as a model from which to teach.\nThe Gate was painted in 195960 as part of a series of works loosely devoted to architectonic volumes. Hofmann used rectangles of color to reinforce the shape of his essentially unvarying easel-painting format. Although The Gate is subjectless, Hofmann insisted that, even in abstraction, students should always work from nature in some form. With determination, a viewer can see that the complex spatial relationship established by the floating planes of color begins to resemble the gate of the title.\nCornelia Lauf\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIsamu Noguchi was an American artist whose artistic education took place in the requisite arena for the avant-garde of the first half of the century: Paris. Yet he was of Japanese origin, and as he slowly came in touch with his own cultural roots he increasingly shifted his emphasis away from a formal aesthetic vocabulary founded on the works of sculptors such as Constantin Brancusi in favor of a uniquely Japanese appreciation for the innate beauty of even the simplest materials. His art reveals both a debt to 20th-century sculptural canons and a rare understanding of the means by which geological and organic materials can be transformed. He once remarked, Abandoned stones which I become interested in invite me to enter into their lifes purpose. It is my task to define and make visible the intent of their being.Carl Andre made a similar transition to a Zen-like Minimalism. Yet the works of the two artists are entirely different, perhaps because Noguchi belonged to the previous generation, for which, as he said, sculpture comes from time-consuming difficulty, not industrial reproduction. This existentialist emphasis on the mastery of lifes circumstances characterizes his early sets for the dances of Martha Graham and such sculptures as The Cry and Lunar. The Lunar series came about in the 1940s, when Noguchi became fascinated by the reflection of light on form. Lunar is cut out of anodized aluminum and mounted, in contrast, on a wooden base. The aluminum is a softly reflective surface, sensitive to variations in light. The Cry, on the other hand, is malleable as a result of another natural forcewind. It was made in 1959 out of balsa wood, although it was cast in bronze a few years later. The Guggenheim Museum owns the balsa original, in which Noguchi attempted to create the lightest possible form of solid sculpture. Its elements are loosely connected so that they vibrate in response to air currents. Many of the qualities explored in The Cry and Lunar are also found in Noguchis akari, the ethereal lamps for which he has become best known. Patterned on the paper lanterns hanging outside of traditional homes in Japan, the akari continued Noguchis earlier interest in the potential luminosity and weightlessness of sculpture.Cornelia Lauf\r\n        ",

In 1945, Carla Accardi moved from her native Sicily to the artistic center of Rome, where she and several other artists, including Piero Dorazio and Giulio Turcato, organized themselves into a group they called Forma 1, dedicated to pursuing abstract art. Her work attracted the attention of critic Michel Tapie, who included her in several European shows of abstract painting. Accardi would remain an important and influential figure for the younger Italian artists associated with the Arte Povera movement in the later 1960s; some of her best-known works are very much in that idiom, such as her series of Tendatents constructed of clear plastic sheets, which she would cover with brightly colored patterns, creating a tension between transparency and density, shelter and exposure, painting and construction. Accardis two-dimensional works are equally layered. Blue Concentric (Concentrico blu, 1960) is a swirling matrix of arabesques and organic, even vaguely bodily forms that generate the circles within circles that give the painting its titleand its dynamism.\nMeghan Dailey\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlthough often cited as the originator of Action Painting, an abstract, purely formal and intuitive means of expression, Willem de Kooning most often worked from observable reality, primarily from figures and the landscape. From 1950 to 1955, De Kooning completed his famous Women series, integrating the human form with the aggressive paint application, bold colors, and sweeping strokes of Abstract Expressionism. These female portraits provoked controversy not only with their vulgar carnality and garish colors, but also because of their embrace of figural representation, a choice deemed regressive by many of De Kooning's Abstract Expressionist contemporaries, but one to which he consistently returned for many decades.Composition serves as a bridge between the Women and De Kooning's next series of work, classified by critic Thomas Hess as the Abstract Urban Landscapes (195558). According to the artist, the landscape is in the Woman and there is Woman in the landscapes. Indeed, Composition reads as a Woman obfuscated by De Kooning's agitated brushwork,clashing colors, and all-over composition with no fixed viewpoint. Completed while the artist had a studio in downtown New York, Composition's, energized dashes of red, turquoise, and chrome yellow suggest the frenetic pace of city life, without representing any identifiable urban inhabitants or forms.Even at the height of his Abstract Urban Landscapes series De Kooning relies, however subconsciously, on references to the female body. This can be seen in the abstracted contours painted in fleshlike hues of Untitled (1958). In the late 1950s De Kooning reduced the frenzied proliferation of stroke, form, and plane that had characterized his preceding work to yield compositions of relative restraint and clarity. Villa Borghese is marked by expansive areas of color, contoured only by the physical edges of the paint, which underline the textural complexities of the medium. The work nonetheless recalls through its title and horizontal orientation a view of the Italian countryside.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nDuring the early 1960s Jim Dine was part of a loosely affiliated group of artistsincluding Red Grooms, Claes Oldenburg, and Lucas Samaraswho extended the gestural and subjective implications of Abstract Expressionist painting into outrageous performances, subsequently known as Happenings. Inspired by John Cages radical approach to musical composition, which involved chance, indeterminacy, and an emphatic disregard for all artistic boundaries, they sought to transgress preexisting aesthetic values. Dine and Oldenburg brought this sensibility to bear on a two-artist exhibition called Ray-Gun, held at the Judson Gallery in New York in February and March 1960. For the show, each artist made an installation consisting of a chaotic configuration of found and manipulated objects. In Dines jumbled environment, The House, the walls and ceiling of the gallery were effaced by an agglomeration of painted cloth, fragmented domestic objects, scrawled slogans, crumbled paper, and suspended metal bedsprings. Scattered throughout were cardboard signs spelling out various household platitudes, such as BREAKFAST IS READY and GO TO WORK. Dine claimed that the juxtaposition of these and other banal phrases with the surrounding domestic wreckage revealed the potential violence inherent to a home. His critique of the myth of the happy home was amplified by anthropomorphic referencespainted eyes, faces, and other body partsthat were hidden or lost amid the detritus. This accretion of fragmented figures, discarded articles, and tattered elements is present, albeit in abbreviated form, in Dines sculpture Bedspring, which may have been part of (or at least inspired by) The House. A year later Dine began making paintings of discrete itemsa hat, a necktie, and the necklace in Pearls, composed of rubber ball halves covered with metallic paint. Although often construed as Pop art emblems, these paintings, which include the names of the depicted objects and, in some cases, collage elements, are more conceptually oriented than the playful and bold appropriations of popular imagery made by Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol. By so blatantly and provocatively combining word, image, and object, Dine invited an investigation into the presumed difference between representation and reality, the construction of meaning, and the arbitrary nature of language.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nYves Klein's first passion in life was judo. In 1952 he moved to Tokyo and studied at the Ko-do-kan Judo Institute, where he earned a black belt. When he returned to Paris in 1955 and discovered to his dismay that the Federation Francaise de Judo did not extol him as a star, he shifted his attentions and pursued a secondary interesta career in the arts. During the ensuing seven years Klein assembled a multifarious and critically complex body of work ranging from monochrome canvases and wall reliefs to paintings made with fire. He is renowned for his almost exclusive use of a strikingly resonant, powdery ultramarine pigment, which he patented under the name International Klein Blue, claiming that it represented the physical manifestation of cosmic energy that, otherwise invisible, floats freely in the air. In addition to monochrome paintings, Klein applied this pigment to sponges, which he attached to canvases as relief elements or positioned on wire stands to create biomorphic or anthropomorphic sculptures. First exhibited in Paris in 1959, the sponge sculpturesall essentially alike, yet ultimately all differentformed a forest of discrete objects surrounding the gallery visitors. About these works Klein explained, Thanks to the spongesraw living matterI was going to be able to make portraits of the observers of my monochromes, who . . . after having voyaged in the blue of my pictures, return totally impregnated in sensibility, as are the sponges.1For his Anthropometries series, Klein famously used nude female models drenched in paint as brushes. His system of pressing bodies against the paper support (which was later mounted on canvas) rejected any illusion of a third dimension in the pictorial space. In these works, the subject, object, and medium become confused with one another to produce a trace of the body's presence. Klein's unconventional activities also included releasing thousands of blue balloons into the sky, and exhibiting an empty, white-walled room and then selling portions of the interior air, which he called zones of immaterial pictorial sensibility. His intentions remain perplexing thirty years after his sudden death. Whether Klein truly believed in the mystical capacity of the artist to capture cosmic particles in paint and to create aesthetic experiences out of thin air and then apportion them at whim is difficult to determine. The argument has also been made that he was essentially a parodist who mocked the metaphysical inclinations of many modern painters, while making a travesty of the art market.Nancy Spector1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn fall 1958, after her first New York solo exhibition at the Betty Parsons Gallery, Agnes Martin abandoned her earlier biomorphic abstractions and embarked on a series of square-format works featuring the all-over geometric template of the grid. Martin used serial procedures and noncompositional strategies that involved intersecting or adjacent horizontal and vertical marks, and integrated the practices of painting and drawing.In the 1960 ink drawing Untitled #16, Martin formed an all-over pattern made of horizontal rows of dots and dash-like broken lines, overlaying larger elliptical shapes that both cancel and emphasize the optical vibrations created by her disjointed graphic marks. The stains of smudged ink, the irregularity of the dots, and the unevenness of the lines reflect the fragile contingency of the artists touch. A recurring motif in her early 1960s work, dot-dash patterns also appear in the painting White Flower (1960) and in the ink-and-pencil drawing Untitled (Drawing) #31 (1960), where vertical lines and horizontal dot-dash traces together form rectangles surrounded by an empty border. The blank frame, a common device in Martins practice, makes the drawn structure appear as a figure on a ground, disrupting the grids suggestion of infinite expansion. Enclosures and frames also play an important role in an untitled work from 1960 and Little Sister (1962). The everyday materials such as brass nails in Little Sister recall Martins 1950s planar constructions, which she built from found objects and later destroyed. Reminiscent of her dot-dash marks, the nail heads emphasize the materiality of the support and produce a staccato rhythm that thwarts the continuity of the unevenly drawn ink lines.In contrast to the early 1960s works, Martins late 70s watercolors feature lateral expanses of delicately colored washes rich in atmospheric effects. Two 1977 works on paper (both untitled) consist of wide, horizontal pencil lines and blue, pink, and yellow watercolor stains; the negative space created by a blank area is as important as the colors around it. They belong to a group of works Martin began after her 1973 retrospective at Philadelphias Institute of Contemporary Art, which marked the end of her six-year withdrawal from painting, and first showed in spring 1978 at the Pace Gallery in New York. Their luminous color washes emphasize the interdependence of color and form, opacity and transparency, and line and field by appearing to dissolve the geometry of the horizontal areas. Informed by her interest in Taoism, Zen Buddhism, and by her sensory memories and experiences of nature, especially of the Southwestern landscape, Martins paintings and drawings consist of sequences of cadenced variations of austere forms and engender a wide range of optical and textural allusions. As the artist put it, the works are light, lightness, about merging, about formlessness, breaking down forms.1Agnes Berecz1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nAgnes Martins earliest experiments with an abstract idiom were based on her observations of the desert terrain of New Mexico, where she lived during the 1940s. It was there that she developed a personal vocabulary of provocative, abstract formssimilar to the formative biomorphic or pictographic works of William Baziotes, Adolph Gottlieb, and Mark Rothkoat a time when American artists were searching for the aesthetic means to convey subjective states and to intimate the existence of other, higher realities. By 1960 Martin had developed her signature grid pattern; the compositional motifs of these pristine, monochromatic paintings consist of a simple system of interlocking horizontal and vertical lines in an almost exclusively six-foot-square format. The titles of these geometrically organized picturesMountains (1960), Dark River (1961), Starlight (1963), Leaf in the Wind (1963), Orange Grove (1965), Spring (1965), and White Flower (1960), to cite just a fewattest to Martins persistent engagement with themes of the organic world, albeit in an abstract manner. At this time she distilled the appearance of empirical entities and expressed her own emotional response to nature through the most extreme economy of formal means. Anything, Martin claimed in 1972, can be painted without representation.1Unlike the more rigidly formulaic art of much Minimalist work, there is nothing systematic about Martins use of the grid; the arrangement of coordinates shifts in scale and rhythm from work to work. The grid in White Flowercomposed of intersecting white lines that form individual rectangles punctuated by symmetrical white dashesresembles woven fabric. Consistent throughout Martins mature oeuvre is an absolute equivalence of form. The compositions are emphatically nonhierarchical; no one component is privileged over another. The delicacy of Martins stylepromoted by the artists frequent use of light graphite lines and cool tones such as pink and pale graymasks her impulse toward stringent formal equality. Her paintings must be read as unitary entities, not as assemblies of single elements. This does not mitigate the complexity of their construction, however. The freely drawn grids, fragile, almost dissolving lines, and hushed tones of the paintings require quiet contemplation in order for the subtleties of their individual compositions to be revealed.Nancy Spector1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1954, a year following the departure of his longtime companion Francoise Gilot, Pablo Picasso was touched by the death of artists and friends Andre Derain, Henri Laurens, Henri Matisse, and Maurice Raynal. Jacqueline Roque, whom Picasso met in 1953, became his companion and remained with him throughout the remainder of his life. (Jacquelines image permeates his work from 1954 until his death.) In 1955 the couple took up residence in La Californie, an elaborate 19th-century villa overlooking Cannes. These years and events mark the point of departure for the last phases of Picassos production.In his art of this period, Picasso dedicated himself to the exploration of the subject of painting. Almost systematically, he paints variations on and improvisations of old master paintings, turning to the works of Jacques-Louis David, Eugene Delacroix, Edouard Manet, Nicolas Poussin, and Diego Velazquez, among others. As art historian David Sylvester suggested, Picasso entered a friendly but competitive dialogue with the paintings of the past. Picasso himself admitted in a note written on the inside back cover of a sketchbook that, Painting is stronger than I am; it makes me do whatever it wants.Painted in an expressionist manner, Two Doves with Wings Spread and a later, second version were completed while Picasso was staying at La Californie, where he had built a dovecote on the third-floor balcony. Doves and pigeons figure in a number of works in Picassos oeuvre (and interestingly, in that of his father, Jose Ruiz Blasco), such as his poster depicting a dove for the 1948 Peace Congress and several ceramic works from 1953.The last twenty years of Picassos life are marked as much by the enormous number of canvases the artist produced as by the controversial reception of these works. Criticized for the pictorial shorthand he developed to preserve the spontaneity and expressive value of his work, this period of Picassos production is often neglected. However, as has been suggested, Picassos formal explorationsa brushstroke that is sometimes stenographic and abbreviated, or frequently thick and flowingis a continuation of the artists lifelong challenge to stylistic convention, and evidence of his drive to convey vitality, liberation, and the desire to make fewer decisions as a defense against the fleeting nature of time: I have less and less time and I have more and more to say.Tracey Bashkoff\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nCy Twomblys paintings of the early 1960s consist of white canvases upon which he has applied scribblings and scratches in a furious flurry of crayon, pencil, and paint. The pigments are squeezed from the tube, remaining as globules that appear to hang tenuously from the surface or, as in Untitled, ejaculations of paint that drip off the canvas and are invaded by crayon and pencil smears. Like Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, Twombly employed the Abstract Expressionists liberating aleatory use of paint, but without their heroic pretensions or universalist goals. Twombly and his colleagues utilized an iconography of everyday life (such as representations of numbers and letters) and incorporated found objects into their work, embracing banal methods such as stenciling. The suggestion of carelessness and defilement inherent in Twomblys paintings (they elicit comparisons with the sexual graffiti in a public latrine) is also present in the work of Rauschenberg, with whom Twombly traveled to Italy in 1953.In 1957 Twombly settled in Rome, where he inspired a small school of calligraphic painters. Some of the main elements of his mature worksthe graffitilike writing on a surface that suggests a wall, and an emphasis on the material properties of his mediumsdovetail with the leading concerns of continental painters, particularly of those associated with Informale (the Italian equivalent of Art Informel). Twomblys work is filled with references to his adopted home as well as to a broader neo-classical tradition; he often alludes to mythological subjects, Old Master painters, and local places or events through his titles and scrawled words or phrases on the surfaces of the works. Idyllic landscapes and their connotation of bacchanalian pleasures have consistently provided Twombly with inspiration. The palette of Untitled, for example, bears the faint echo of an 18th-century painting of a fete champetre by Boucher or Fragonard in which sensual youths with powdered hair and strawberry-and-cream complexions gambol in sylvan glades, the breezy subject loaded with erotic innuendo. In Twomblys painting the explosive sexual charge of splatters and scribbles is complicated by a hermetic language of modern charts and graphs as if, according to art critic Roberta Smith, an overeducated bibliophiliac suddenlygraphically, nearly obscenely[speaks] in tongues.1Jennifer Blessing1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nAs a child, Yaacov Agam, whose father was a rabbi, was educated in the synagogue rather than a secular school, and his immersion in Judaism and the Kabbalah had a major impact on his art. While he avidly produced drawings in his youth, he has noted that reading Lust for Life (1934), a biographical novel about Vincent van Gogh, marked a turning point for him. After briefly studying at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem, he left for Zurich, where he worked with former Bauhaus professor Johannes Itten; Max Bill, the founder of Concrete art; and the architectural historian and theoretician Siegfried Giedion. In 1951 Agam stopped in Paris on his way to begin studies at the Institute of Design (also known as the New Bauhaus) in Chicago. He decided to remain in the French capital, and during the next couple of years he became acquainted with the most recent developments in geometric abstraction as well as fellow artists seeking to develop new approaches to art, among them Yves Klein.\nIn 1953 Agam had a solo show at the Galerie Craven, where he exhibited 18 abstract paintings that encouraged the physical engagement of the audience; some required viewers to alter their vantage point, while others invited the physical manipulation of elements of the works. In 1955 he participated in the historic show Le mouvement (The Movement) held at the Galerie Denise Rene. Considered by many as the first major show of Optical and Kinetic art, the exhibition marked the emergence of Agam, Pol Bury, Jesus Rafael Soto, and Jean Tinguely as proponents of a new \"transformable\" art that required the active participation of the viewer in the completion of the work.\nUnlike these artists, however, Agam drew on his background in Judaism theorizing the work of art as a vital, ever-evolving entity. He refused to allow his art to stress immutable, invariable conditions, and instead he sought to create a work of art that remained in a constant state of becoming.\nAventure Pictural (Pictural Adventure, 1961) exemplifies Agam's emphasis on variation, participation, and optical playfulness. In the center of a black monochromatic ground, he rendered a series of variously colored parallel lines and other geometric forms that together take the form of a square. Seen frontally, these elements appear to be static, separate entities, yet they simultaneously seem to flutter. Viewed from the sides, they merge to form distinct abstract compositions that suggest both movement and three-dimensionality; a series of triangles emerges from the right, and a series of squares from the left.\nIn this work the act of viewing becomes an adventure for the viewer, who must discover the different pictures contained in a single object, a process of looking that unfolds over time and within a range of possibilities predetermined by the artist. For Agam, such \"polyphonic\" works give form to the notion that nothing in nature is fixed and that everything is merely a fragment of a larger unity.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWilliam Baziotes's paintings are freely improvised, intuitive affairs created in the spirit of Surrealist automatism. Each canvas, he claimed in 1947, \"has its own way of evolving. . . . Each beginning suggests something. . . . The suggestion then becomes a phantom that must be caught and made real.\"1 For Baziotes, the \"reality\" he aspired to exists only in a poetic realm, one in which color and form serve as analogues for psychological and emotional states. This use of visual metaphor was inspired by the artist's love for poetry, particularly that of Charles Baudelaire, whose theory of \"correspondences\" proclaimed the fundamental equivalence of all things in nature and the capacity of any designated thing to symbolize something beyond itself. By the late 1940s Baziotes achieved his signature formal motifdelicate, semitranslucent, biomorphic shapes suspended within aqueous fields of muted colorwhich invokes the Baudelairian world of allusion and association. \"The emphasis on flora, fauna and beings,\" explained the artist about his painting, \"brings forth those strange memories and psychic feelings that mystify and fascinate all of us.\"2Baziotes shared his keen interest in nature with other artists of the New York School, who were motivated simultaneously by their search for primordial truths and their fascination with scientific inquiry. What bridged these two utopian investigations was the microscope; the invisible world of protean forms it revealed promised to disclose the origins of life. This preoccupation with identifying metaphysical features of the organic realm may illuminate Baziotes's predilection for marine imagery, as demonstrated in Aquatic (1961), a painting of serpentine forms swimming through a calm, watery world. The symbolic possibilities of the ocean are vast and Baziotes drew on many of its meanings. Aquatic has been interpreted as an expression of the artist's romantic vision of the sea as a domain of symbiotic relationships. The artist was captivated by the mating practice of eels, which swim through the ocean, rarely touching but always together. The delicately intertwined lines in the picture have been thought to represent these faithful eels on their course through the watery depths. Nancy Spector1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nDuring the early 1960s Jim Dine was part of a loosely affiliated group of artistsincluding Red Grooms, Claes Oldenburg, and Lucas Samaraswho extended the gestural and subjective implications of Abstract Expressionist painting into outrageous performances, subsequently known as Happenings. Inspired by John Cages radical approach to musical composition, which involved chance, indeterminacy, and an emphatic disregard for all artistic boundaries, they sought to transgress preexisting aesthetic values. Dine and Oldenburg brought this sensibility to bear on a two-artist exhibition called Ray-Gun, held at the Judson Gallery in New York in February and March 1960. For the show, each artist made an installation consisting of a chaotic configuration of found and manipulated objects. In Dines jumbled environment, The House, the walls and ceiling of the gallery were effaced by an agglomeration of painted cloth, fragmented domestic objects, scrawled slogans, crumbled paper, and suspended metal bedsprings. Scattered throughout were cardboard signs spelling out various household platitudes, such as BREAKFAST IS READY and GO TO WORK. Dine claimed that the juxtaposition of these and other banal phrases with the surrounding domestic wreckage revealed the potential violence inherent to a home. His critique of the myth of the happy home was amplified by anthropomorphic referencespainted eyes, faces, and other body partsthat were hidden or lost amid the detritus. This accretion of fragmented figures, discarded articles, and tattered elements is present, albeit in abbreviated form, in Dines sculpture Bedspring, which may have been part of (or at least inspired by) The House. A year later Dine began making paintings of discrete itemsa hat, a necktie, and the necklace in Pearls, composed of rubber ball halves covered with metallic paint. Although often construed as Pop art emblems, these paintings, which include the names of the depicted objects and, in some cases, collage elements, are more conceptually oriented than the playful and bold appropriations of popular imagery made by Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol. By so blatantly and provocatively combining word, image, and object, Dine invited an investigation into the presumed difference between representation and reality, the construction of meaning, and the arbitrary nature of language.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the early 1940s, Adolph Gottlieb was one of several American artists who responded to the horrors of the Second World War by turning to archaic myth and so-called primitive art. Dismissing the reigning schools of American painting as hopelessly provincial and inadequate to the historical moment, yet wishing to forge a path distinct from European Surrealism, Gottlieb found in the tribal art of Africa, Oceania, and North America a model for the expression of essential, universal truths. His belief in a global language of art lay behind the series of paintings he initiated in 1941, his Pictographs, which he continued until the end of the next decade. In these works, Gottlieb placed hieroglyphic-like and totemlike signsfrom body parts, such as eyes and hands, to schematized animalsin the cells of flat, loosely painted grids. The grid format had its immediate antecedent in a group of enigmatic still lifes (193940), featuring objects set into boxes with multiple compartments. Critics and art historians have pointed to numerous art-historical precedents for this motif, such as the paintings of Piet Mondrian and Joaquin Torres-Garcia as well as the box constructions of Joseph Cornell. For Gottlieb, however, the nonhierarchical compartmentalization of the canvas was primarily a vehicle for facilitating the mysterious juxtaposition of archetypal signs. Gottlieb arranged his signs intuitively, in a process he described as free association, and he intended for the paintings to be received at a purely visual level, rather than read and deciphered like language. While his earliest Pictographs take the Oedipus myth as their subject, those of the mid-1940s, such as Augury (1945), are broader in reference, with titles suggesting magic and prophecy.Gottliebs paintings underwent another significant transformation in the 1950s, as he abandoned the grid, simplified his forms, and greatly increased the scale of his canvases. In the vertical Bursts he began in 1957, of which Mist (1961) is an example, a diffused, disclike form in the upper zone hovers over an explosion of calligraphic brushstrokes in the lower zone. Despite their abstraction, the Bursts call forth a range of associations, from landscapes and cosmic forms to nuclear mushroom clouds. Although at first glance these works may appear wholly unrelated from the earlier Pictographs, both series rely on the juxtaposition of forms and are characterized by an underlying dualism. While the Pictographs merge irrational symbols and an automatist process with the rational, preconceived order of the grid, the Bursts assemble in single canvases the two poles of Abstract Expressionist paintingthe so-called Color Field and Action schools of Gottliebs contemporariesin a tense balance.Ted Mann\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nBorn to Russian-Jewish parents who had emigrated from Odessafirst to Canada and then to Los AngelesPhilip Guston developed his interest in art making from a very young age. He befriended classmate Jackson Pollock at the Los Angeles Manual Arts High School where the two learned about modern European art, Eastern philosophy, theosophy, and mystic literature from their teacher Frederick John de St. Vrain Schwankovsky. But when the young artists co-authored a petition protesting the school's emphasis on athletics over art, they were promptly expelled. While Guston never returned to finish high school, he continued to pursue his art under the influence of Renaissance painters Piero della Francesca, Masaccio, and Paolo Uccello; Mexican muralists Jose Orozco, Diego Rivera, and David Siqueiros (Guston served as his assistant for a time); and the American Regionalists, particularly Thomas Hart Benton.\nIn the early 1930s Guston produced a series of murals in California that reflected a synthesis of these artistic sources as well as his leftist political leanings. It was during this time that he first began to represent hooded figures, a motif that would recur throughout his career. An encounter with the paintings of the Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico in the Louise and Walter Arensberg Collection had an impact on his representation of these figures, but his primary source of inspiration was the Ku Klux Klan, whose presence was strongly felt in Los Angeles at that time. Early works that featured Klansmen were defaced or destroyed by unknown parties and these experiences solidified his attachment to the theme.\nIn 1935 he moved to New York at Pollock's urging and joined the mural section of the Federal Art Project, part of the Works Progress Administration established by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Great Depression. In the late 1940s Guston began to work in a loosely geometric, abstract style, and for the better part of the decade he taught at various schools in the Midwest. By 1951 he had returned to New York and dedicated himself to exploring gestural abstraction in works dominated by short strokes concentrated in the center of the canvas and characterized by vertical and horizontal lines interlaced to create a series of right angles. His palette principally consisted of muted reds, pinks, and grays. While many have referred to his work of this period as Abstract Impressionist, Guston rejected this label.\nIn 1959 Guston incorporated a loosely rendered image of a hooded figure with paintbrush in hand in The Painter. With this work, he initiated a series of paintings in which he tested the boundaries between figuration and abstraction. Duo (1961) belongs to this transitional body of work. Two dark forms situated in a multitude of subtly differentiated grays dominate the composition. Touches of blue, red, yellow, and pink are woven through the gray brushstrokes to create an atmosphere surrounding the two central figures. As in his nonrepresentational works, Guston left the periphery of the canvas bare and focused on the middle where he has built up layers of pigment. The moodiness and predominantly black-and-gray palette of this and similar works have led art historians to refer to them as Guston's \"dark paintings.\"\nThe return of the hooded figure in Duo and other pictures of the early-to-mid-1960s foreshadowed Guston's focus on this subject in his late work, which represented a radical departure from his abstract paintings and drew on the visual language of cartoons and a vivid palette of reds, pinks, and grays.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nGunther Uecker was born in Wendorf, in what was to become East Germany. As a young person he attended a series of technical colleges where he studied painting, commercial art, and applied arts, which prepared him for a brief career designing slogans and propagandistic paintings for window displays and political events. During an international youth festival in 1951, he crossed over to West Berlin and was inspired by his first encounter with abstract art. In 1953 he moved to the West German city, where he responded to an initial sense of isolation by studying various religious philosophies, including anthroposophy, Islam, Taoism, Buddhism, and Zenmodes of thinking that informed his later work.In 1955 Uecker moved to Dusseldorf and enrolled at the Staatliche Kunstakademie. He explored existential philosophy as well as gestural abstract painting, which was then in vogue in Western Europe and known as Art Informel. He also made works dominated by bursts of dynamic lines suggestive of Italian Futurism. By 1958, after spending time with the French artist Yves Klein in the summer of 1957, Uecker had fused his interest in line and the tactility of paint with an exploration of the monochrome. Uecker's monochromes combined thickly applied oil paint with vertical or horizontal striations traced in the surface. In 1958 he displayed one of these worksa red canvas with the imprint of an irregular gridlike patternin Das rote Bild (The Red Picture), the seventh one-night exhibition held at the studios of Otto Piene and Heinz Mack, founders of the Gruppo Zero (Group Zero), which Uecker would join in 1961.At this same time Uecker began to investigate the potential of nails as a material for his art. Initially, his experiments were an extension of his monochromes, as he embedded the nails into the surface of single-colored paintings and objects. Although he sometimes applied them in informal patterns across the picture plane, in many works the nails mapped a gridlike pattern, fusing the monochrome and the grid. Uecker has noted that he regarded nails \"as structural elements,\" and was \"trying . . . to create vibrations by using these materials in an ordered relationship to one another, one that disturbs the geometric order and may even irritate.\"1While he could elicit a sensation of vibration through the play of light across the nailsespecially when he created circles with nails inserted at varying depthshe achieved even more effective results by setting his compositions in motion. Simple motors rendered some works kinetic, and others, such as Tactile Rotating Structure (Taktile Struktur Rotierend, 1961), required the viewer's manual activation. In this piece the viewer turns a nail-studded circular relief in the center of a silver burlap background. When at rest, the porcupine-like protrusion of nails seems at once comical and threatening; but once it is animated, the combination of light and motion generates a series of ever changing, dematerialized images that, according to Uecker, embody a spiritual potential.1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1944, one of the most devastating years of World War II, Francis Bacon painted Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion. With this horrific triptych depicting vaguely anthropomorphic creatures writhing in anguish, Bacon established his reputation as one of England's foremost figurative painters and a ruthless chronicler of the human condition. During the ensuing years, certain disturbing subjects recurred in Bacon's oeuvre: disembodied, almost faceless portraits; mangled bodies resembling animal carcasses; images of screaming figures; and idiosyncratic versions of the Crucifixion.One of the most frequently represented subjects in Western art, the Crucifixion has come to symbolize far more than the historical and religious event itself. Rendered in modern times by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso, and Barnett Newman, this theme bespeaks human suffering on a universal scale while also addressing individual pain. The Crucifixion appeared in Bacon's work as early as 1933. Even though he was an avowedly irreligious man, Bacon viewed the Crucifixion as a \"magnificent armature\" from which to suspend \"all types of feeling and sensation.\" It provided the artist with a predetermined format on which to inscribe his own interpretive renderings, allowing him to evade narrative contenthe disdained painting as illustrationand to concentrate, instead, on emotional and perceptual evocation. His persistent use of the triptych format (also traditionally associated with religious painting) furthered the narrative disjunction in the works through the physical separation of the elements that comprise them.That Bacon saw a connection between the brutality of slaughterhouses and the Crucifixion is particularly evident in the Guggenheim's paintings. The crucified figure slithering down the cross in the right panel, a form derived from the sinuous body of Christ in Cimabue's renowned 13th-century Crucifixion, is splayed open like the butchered carcass of an animal. Slabs of meat in the left panel corroborate this reading. Bacon believed that animals in slaughterhouses suspect their ultimate fate. Seeing a parallel current in the human experienceas symbolized by the Crucifixion in that it represents the inevitability of deathhe has explained, \"we are meat, we are potential carcasses.\" The bulbous, bloodied man lying on the divan in the center further expresses this notion by embodying human mortality.Nancy Spector\n",

The whirling arabesques of color in wall reliefs such as Dolores James echo the energy and expressive power of paintings by Willem de Kooning; the heroic scale and animated diagonals suggest the canvases of Franz Kline. Like the Abstract Expressionists before him, Chamberlain reveled in the potential of his mediums. In a 1972 interview with critic Phyllis Tuchman he remarked, Im sort of intrigued with the idea of what I can do with material and I work with the material as opposed to enforcing some kind of will upon it. Chamberlain emphasized the importance of fit, or the marriage of parts, in his sculpture. As in other early works, the various elements of Dolores James stayed in place by virtue of careful balances when the sculpture was first assembled; later, the work was spot-welded to ensure its preservation.Chamberlains oeuvre appeared in the context of late-1950s assemblage or Junk Art, in which the detritus of our culture was reconsidered and reinterpreted as fine art. On some level, his conglomerations of automobile carcasses must inevitably be perceived as witnesses of the car culture from which they were born, and for which they serve as memorials. There is a threatening air about the jagged-edged protuberances in Chamberlains sculptures, and the dirty, dented automobile components suggest car crashes; the artist, however, preferred to focus on the poetic evocations that his sculptures elicit.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nJean Dubuffet's career was marked by a resistance to the conventions of artistic practice. He favored the commonplace over the rarified, and the raw over the refined; as he developed his style and method he looked to the work of untrained artists and made use of unconventional materials and techniques. With the memory of the atrocities of World War II still fresh, Dubuffet dismissed the notion of beauty altogether, pursuing an art of uncompromising immediacy and aggression, which he christened Art Brut. Contrary to everything expected of a painter in the French tradition, Art Brut was inspired by graffiti and the art of the mentally illforms of art making traditionally ignored by the avant-garde.\nThe agitated line and heavy impasto of Propitious Moment (L'instant propice, 1962) indicate a spontaneity and directness in keeping with Art Brut. The brilliant palette and loosening forms of this and other works from the series Paris Circus (196162) suggest a shift away from the rugged, earthy quality of his earlier works toward a more decorative impulse inspired by the urban landscape of the French capital. Propitious Moment reflects Dubuffet's tendency in the mature paintings of the series to ground his figures in ambiguous, abstract settings. Here the flattened, vibrating bodies, defined solely through two layers of contour lines, merge with their shimmering background. This dialectic between abstraction and figuration is echoed in the work of Dubuffet's contemporaries in both Europe and America, such as Alberto Giacometti, Adolph Gottlieb, and Jackson Pollock.\nAlthough Propitious Moment and other works of the Paris Circus period may appear as a break with Dubuffet's earlier compositions, the artist insisted on a continuity. In his attempt to rehabilitate values and materials dismissed by Western aesthetics, what mattered to Dubuffet were unbridled energy, spontaneity, and truth to self. His aggressively anticultural, anti-aesthetic attitude provided an example for members of the CoBrA group in Europe, such as Karel Appel and Asger Jorn, and to New York artists such as Claes Oldenburgall of whom, like Dubuffet, sought in their art to collapse the terms \"high\" and \"low.\"\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1963 Roy Lichtenstein defended Pop art against its critics, contending that there are certain things that are usable, forceful, and vital about commercial art. By choosing comic-book illustrations as a theme, and using simulated Benday dots to suggest cheap printing, Lichtenstein acknowledged (and perhaps questioned) the role of this popular form of entertainment in daily life. There is also an element of humor in creating fine art out of what has customarily been considered low, a playfulness that is equally evident in the onomatopoeic caption and bellicose expression of the dog in Grrrrrrrrrrr!! (1965)Lichtenstein cultivated imagery from the history of art while continuing to use the conventions of comics and advertisements. In Preparedness (1968) he used the Benday-dot technique to make a wall-size painting (10 feet high by 18 feet wide) that suggests the work of Fernand Leger and the WPA artists of the 1930s, who painted monumental murals, readable at a distance, on themes of workers and everyday life. Lichtenstein followed this practice to an ironic and somewhat subversive end. Painted during a year when public opinion on the Vietnam War shifted dramatically, Lichtensteins massive depiction of machinery and soldiers probes the conventions of selling the promises of the military-industrial complex, while quietly alluding to the naive optimism underlying a call to arms.Lichtenstein often focused on the way his traditional and mass-media sources resolve the dilemmas of representing three dimensions on a flat picture plane, incorporating their solutions into his own work with witty exaggeration. Preparedness plays the fragmented Cubist collage space of Leger against comic-strip modes of suggesting form and the surface quality of objects. Lichtensteins inclusion of an airplane window in the third panel of the painting foreshadows his engagement with modes of conveying the illusion of reflective glass, which he went on to explore in a series of paintings of mirrors. Interior with Mirrored Wall (1991) is a later development of this exploration. In a series of works depicting banal domestic environments inspired by furniture ads he found in telephone books, Lichtenstein continued his previous investigations of illusionistic representational devices, here by including the eponymous mirrored wall and the gleaming, polished grand piano. His references to high-art sources included his own work, which is shown framed on the wall. The floor covering also implicitly acknowledges Henri Matisses use of decorative patterns.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn fall 1958, after her first New York solo exhibition at the Betty Parsons Gallery, Agnes Martin abandoned her earlier biomorphic abstractions and embarked on a series of square-format works featuring the all-over geometric template of the grid. Martin used serial procedures and noncompositional strategies that involved intersecting or adjacent horizontal and vertical marks, and integrated the practices of painting and drawing.In the 1960 ink drawing Untitled #16, Martin formed an all-over pattern made of horizontal rows of dots and dash-like broken lines, overlaying larger elliptical shapes that both cancel and emphasize the optical vibrations created by her disjointed graphic marks. The stains of smudged ink, the irregularity of the dots, and the unevenness of the lines reflect the fragile contingency of the artists touch. A recurring motif in her early 1960s work, dot-dash patterns also appear in the painting White Flower (1960) and in the ink-and-pencil drawing Untitled (Drawing) #31 (1960), where vertical lines and horizontal dot-dash traces together form rectangles surrounded by an empty border. The blank frame, a common device in Martins practice, makes the drawn structure appear as a figure on a ground, disrupting the grids suggestion of infinite expansion. Enclosures and frames also play an important role in an untitled work from 1960 and Little Sister (1962). The everyday materials such as brass nails in Little Sister recall Martins 1950s planar constructions, which she built from found objects and later destroyed. Reminiscent of her dot-dash marks, the nail heads emphasize the materiality of the support and produce a staccato rhythm that thwarts the continuity of the unevenly drawn ink lines.In contrast to the early 1960s works, Martins late 70s watercolors feature lateral expanses of delicately colored washes rich in atmospheric effects. Two 1977 works on paper (both untitled) consist of wide, horizontal pencil lines and blue, pink, and yellow watercolor stains; the negative space created by a blank area is as important as the colors around it. They belong to a group of works Martin began after her 1973 retrospective at Philadelphias Institute of Contemporary Art, which marked the end of her six-year withdrawal from painting, and first showed in spring 1978 at the Pace Gallery in New York. Their luminous color washes emphasize the interdependence of color and form, opacity and transparency, and line and field by appearing to dissolve the geometry of the horizontal areas. Informed by her interest in Taoism, Zen Buddhism, and by her sensory memories and experiences of nature, especially of the Southwestern landscape, Martins paintings and drawings consist of sequences of cadenced variations of austere forms and engender a wide range of optical and textural allusions. As the artist put it, the works are light, lightness, about merging, about formlessness, breaking down forms.1Agnes Berecz1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nClaes Oldenburgs absorption with the commonplace was first manifested in his personal collection of toys, plastic food, and knickknacks. These objects served as prototypes for the pieces the artist included in his early Happenings and installations. The burlesque Freighter and Sailboatone of the first soft sculpturesoriginated as a playfully sagging prop in his 1962 series of ten performances Ray Gun Theater. Such sculptural articles played a more central role in Oldenburgs fabricated environment The Store (196162), in one version of which he filled a Manhattan storefront with colorfully painted plaster simulations of ordinary itemsincluding articles of clothing and sundry food productswhich he sold as merchandise. Because of its conflation of creativity with commerce, The Store is often cited as a quintessential moment in the emergence of Pop art.Oldenburgs enterprise, however, suggests many interpretations. The lumpy wares sold at The Store and their later incarnations as large-scale, stuffed vinyl sculpturesincluding a light switch, a toaster, and the pay telephone shown heremay be seen as substitutions for and references to the human body. Through their malleable forms and susceptibility to the effects of gravity, these supple sculptures often suggest specific anatomical parts: hamburgers are breasts, a tube of toothpaste is a phallus. Passive and limp, but potentially arousable, the pieces allude to the sexual, a realm that has been repressed in much Modern, abstract art. By asserting the sensual through the mundane, Oldenburg explores the ways in which everyday objects are so much an extension of ourselves. Anyone familiar with Freuds interpret-ation of dreams, in which domestic items are surrogates for human anatomy, will find a similar equation in Oldenburgs art.After 1964 the artist expanded the range of his work to include monumental public projects while continuing to maintain his engagement with the ordinary and to demonstrate his remarkable sense of humor. The proposed projects (which generally exist only as drawings, prints, and maquettes) include an enormous, buttered baked potato for Brooklyns Grand Army Plaza. When actually constructedsuch as the 24-foot-high lipstick set on an army tank at Yale Universitythe monuments activate their surrounding environments through a subversive mix of political provocation and entertainment.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nVisitors to the Galerie Iris Clert, Paris, in early 1963 were hardly prepared for the painting that greeted them: a colossal, 40-foot-long male nude, precisely and sensually rendered in full anatomical detail. In Paris and later in New York, Chicago, and L.A., the work was greeted with shock, recalls Harold Stevenson, who conceived The New Adam as an homage to his lover, Lord Timothy Willoughby (though the actor Sal Mineo was his model). Spread over nine panels and initially installed as a three-wall wraparound, the work presents a vast, seemingly unbounded ocean of flesh. Art historian and Guggenheim curator Robert Rosenblum has located it within the American tradition of Gigantism, which ranges from sublime 19th-century landscapes of the West to the sprawling abstractions of Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still. The work bears a particular relationship to James Rosenquists monumental, multipanel, Realist wraparound, F-111 (196465), which it predates. It also engages a much older tradition in art, recalling countless female odalisques, as well as Michelangelos iconic image of Adam, whose pointing gesture Stevenson redirects inward, toward the body. The New Adam was once considered for inclusion in Six Painters and the Object (1963), an important early Pop exhibition at the Guggenheim, but it was judged to distract from the thesis of the show. Over 40 years later, the museum is honored to have this landmark of art history join its permanent collection.Ted Mann\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1962 Rauschenberg began using commercially produced silkscreens to make large-format paintings based on his own photographs and found media images, using a technique that he was introduced to by Andy Warhol. These paintings may be considered an extension of the transfer drawings made between 1958 and 1969, in which he directly transferred the contents of newspapers and magazines onto sheets of paper. Since he could photographically enlarge imagery on the silkscreens, this process freed Rauschenberg from the scale restrictions of the transfer technique and allowed him to easily reuse images in varied contexts.Barge, which was executed in a 24-hour period, is the largest of the series of 79 silkscreen paintings the artist made from October 1962 until June 1964. While its imagery is devoted primarily to transportation and transportation-related structuresfreeways, trucks, spacecraft, radar, etc.the painting is bargelike in its scale and dimensions. The canvas also contains many other recognizable imagesathletes, a key, clouds, buildings under construction, mosquitoes, caged birds, passages of stenciled text, and images from Old Master paintings (Diego Velazquez's Rokeby Venus [1647-51] and Peter Paul Rubens's Toilet of Venus [ca. 1606-11], for example). This panoply or cacophony is typical of the artist, who liked things to be messy, complicated, and full of the juxtapositions of everyday life.Rauschenberg often worked in grisaille when experimenting in a new medium, and, characteristically, the earliest silkscreened paintings are in black and white and resultant tones. By August 1963, however, he began to introduce brilliant color into the series. The 41 colored examples are less abstract and contain more readily identifiable imagesspecifically, references to Americana such as baseball, astronauts, then-president John F. Kennedy, and New York street scenes. Rauschenberg abruptly ended the series in June 1964, upon winning the International Grand Prize in Painting at the Venice Biennale: after the press conference on the Giardini grounds, he promptly telephoned his studio assistant in New York, instructing him to destroy all the silkscreens in his studio as a preventive measure against self-repetition.

His embrace of the unadorned fluorescent fixture as an aesthetic object placed him at the forefront of a generation of artists whose use of industrial materials, emphasis on elementary forms, and nonhierarchical relationships among component parts became the salient characteristics of Minimalism.The additive composition of the nominal three (to William of Ockham), dedicated to the 14th-century English philosopher, exemplifies Flavins use of the fluorescent tube as a basic building block. The artists installations became increasingly complex while remaining bound to the limited palette and standard lengths in which the fixtures were commercially produced. His subsequent development of a vocabulary of corners, barriers, and corridors engaged the environment his work occupied and revealed his interest in reconceptualizing sculpture in relation to space. The first of his barrier pieces, greens crossing greens (to Piet Mondrian who lacked green), transforms and even inverts the conventional museum experience by literally invading the viewers space and prohibiting access to the gallery. The reference to Mondrian is in keeping with Flavins practice of dedicating individual works to family, friends, or historical figures of significance to him.The artist Mel Bochner credited Flavins practice as embodying an acute awareness of the phenomenology of rooms. This awareness stemmed from Flavins rejection of studio production in favor of site-specific situations or proposals (as the artist preferred to classify his work) and is nowhere more evident than in his 1971 installation for the Guggenheim, untitled (to Ward Jackson, an old friend and colleague who, during the Fall of 1957 when I finally returned to New York from Washington and joined him to work together in this museum, kindly communicated). Initially occupying one full turn of the museums ramps, and according to the artist, critically fitted to the inconsistent dimensions of the variable architecture, the work was conceived so that it could be extended to fill the entire rotunda, as was done in 1992. At that time, Flavin incorporated untitled (to Ward Jackson . . . ) into an new work dedicated to his fiancee, untitled (to Tracy, to celebrate the love of a lifetime), which featured a column rising from the rotunda floor in a celebratory manner, suffusing the space with a warm pink glow. Together these installations amplified the Frank Lloyd Wright interior, exemplifying Flavins career-long concern with light, space, and color.J. Fiona Ragheb\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nHelen Frankenthaler received an introduction to art making through her primary-school art teacherthe noted Mexican artist Rufino Tamayo. As a young woman she became acquainted with the New York art world under the guidance of the influential American formalist art critic Clement Greenberg, and she took a course in the summer of 1950 with the German painter Hans Hofmann, who had taught many artists associated with Abstract Expressionism. Her early work, all-over compositions dominated by amoeboid forms swirling in space, reflected the influence of Arshile Gorky, Hofmann, Vasily Kandinsky, Joan Miro, and Jackson Pollock.\nFrankenthaler's 1951 encounter with Pollock's work had a major impact on her. His black-and-white ink works on paper of this period suggested to her the possibilities inherent in directly staining the surface of paper or canvas, and she began to explore how to dilute her oil paint to the consistency of watercolors. Like Pollock, she placed her unsized, unprimed canvas on the floor. She applied the paint using a coffee can with a hole cut in it, which allowed her to create puddles that could be left as is or spread on the surface. Fusing foreground and background, color and plane, Frankenthaler's \"soak-stain\" technique created a sense of space even as it emphasized the flatness of the picture plane. Her approach proved influential to Color Field painters including Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland, both of whom visited Frankenthaler's studio in 1953, where they saw her first soak-stain painting, Mountains and Sea (1952).\nOften understood through the writings of Greenbergwho was responsible for taking Noland and Louis to her studio and who once owned Canal (1963)Frankenthaler's soak-stain paintings can be read as embodiments of the flatness of the picture plane and opticality, which Greenberg regarded as the most important characteristic of modernist painting. Greenberg thought that Frankenthaler's use of color overcame the tactility of the picture plane and consequently produced a \"purely optical\" experience of painting. In soaking the canvas in color, Frankenthaler brought painting into the realm of pure vision. However, others have argued that her thinned-down colors, devoid of their glossy coating, actually called attention to the texture of the canvas.\nFrankenthaler painted The Bay, Low Tide, Blue Tide, Blue Causeway, Canal, and other water-inspired canvases in 1963, when she divided her time between New York and her summer home in Provincetown, Massachusetts. In Canal, several large, irregular areas of color interlock and, in places, flow together. The work's forms stain most of the canvas, leaving much of the bottom and right-hand edges raw and untouched. Here Frankenthaler's all-over color field differs from her practice of only two years earlier, when she centered smaller abstract images on expanses of raw canvas, creating shapes that are more clearly representational than the flattened, flowing forms of Canal. This change coincided with the artist's 1962 shift from oil-based to acrylic paints. In adapting her stain techniques to the new medium, Frankenthaler created shapes in semi-transparent, atmospheric tones and in brilliant, dense color with distinct and strong edges. She allowed for accident and intuition while controlling the interplay of form, color, and space.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1950 Heinz Mack enrolled at the Staatliche Kunstakademie, Dusseldorf, where his art-historical training did not include modern art. A trip to Paris introduced him to works by the likes of Henri Matisse, Joan Miro, and Pablo Picasso for the first time. Immediately afterward, Miro exerted a discernible influence on Mack's work; however, the young German quickly turned to a style then dominant in Western Europe, Art Informel, abstract painting characterized by an emphasis on gesture and improvisatory technique. By the mid 1950s Mack was producing paintingswhich he later described as \"documents of chaotic feelings\"with heavily worked surfaces laden with scratchlike calligraphic marks that owe a debt to the art of Hans Hartung and Antoni Tapies.\nAfter graduating from the academy in 1953, Mack and his former classmate Otto Piene undertook philosophy studies at the Universitat zu Koln, Cologne. Upon completion of their degrees in 1957, they sought to redress the total absence of a contemporary gallery system and general lack of institutional support for young artists in Germany by holding one-night exhibitions in their studios (eight between 1957 and 1958). Shortly after the second one they met Yves Klein, whose L'epoque blue (The Blue Period) was the inaugural show at Alfred Schmela's Dusseldorf gallery. Klein's confident self-presentation, coupled with his experimental monochrome paintings, contributed to their decision to form Gruppo Zero (Group Zero), so named because the word could be almost universally understood and signified a new, positive beginning for art.\nBeginning in 1958, Mack produced paintings he called Dynamic Structures (Dynamische Strukturen), which consisted of a black-and-white linear grid that imparted the impression of vibration to the surface of the canvas. Also in 1958, Mack found a means of emphasizing dynamism in his work, which went beyond painting. By imprinting a gridlike pattern in relief on aluminum sheets, he could generate a play of light across the surface that elicited a strong sensation of vibration; he called the resulting works Light Reliefs (Licht-Reliefs). In The Joy of Calvin (Die Freude des Calvin, 1963), Mack covered a wooden panel in aluminum, creating a monochromatic surface. (Just as Klein had identified himself as the painter of the color blue, Mack proclaimed himself the painter of the color silver.) Smooth, silver rectangular planes fill the top and bottom of the vertically oriented panel, and the center contains a stack of seven rows of parallel strips of aluminum, which formally invoke the Dynamic Structure paintings. The shimmering surface, coupled with the wavy lines rendered in relief, allows light, rather than color, to enliven the work and generate a sensation of movement. The piece's title reflects Mack's sustained interest in disciplines beyond art, as it refers to the American scientist Melvin Calvin who proved that sunlight, not carbon dioxide, acts on chlorophyll in a plant to fuel the manufacturing of organic compounds. This referent underscores the formal message of the work itselfnamely, the power of light.\r\n\n",

These objects served as prototypes for the pieces the artist included in his early Happenings and installations. The burlesque Freighter and Sailboatone of the first soft sculpturesoriginated as a playfully sagging prop in his 1962 series of ten performances Ray Gun Theater. Such sculptural articles played a more central role in Oldenburgs fabricated environment The Store (196162), in one version of which he filled a Manhattan storefront with colorfully painted plaster simulations of ordinary itemsincluding articles of clothing and sundry food productswhich he sold as merchandise. Because of its conflation of creativity with commerce, The Store is often cited as a quintessential moment in the emergence of Pop art.Oldenburgs enterprise, however, suggests many interpretations. The lumpy wares sold at The Store and their later incarnations as large-scale, stuffed vinyl sculpturesincluding a light switch, a toaster, and the pay telephone shown heremay be seen as substitutions for and references to the human body. Through their malleable forms and susceptibility to the effects of gravity, these supple sculptures often suggest specific anatomical parts: hamburgers are breasts, a tube of toothpaste is a phallus. Passive and limp, but potentially arousable, the pieces allude to the sexual, a realm that has been repressed in much Modern, abstract art. By asserting the sensual through the mundane, Oldenburg explores the ways in which everyday objects are so much an extension of ourselves. Anyone familiar with Freuds interpret-ation of dreams, in which domestic items are surrogates for human anatomy, will find a similar equation in Oldenburgs art.After 1964 the artist expanded the range of his work to include monumental public projects while continuing to maintain his engagement with the ordinary and to demonstrate his remarkable sense of humor. The proposed projects (which generally exist only as drawings, prints, and maquettes) include an enormous, buttered baked potato for Brooklyns Grand Army Plaza. When actually constructedsuch as the 24-foot-high lipstick set on an army tank at Yale Universitythe monuments activate their surrounding environments through a subversive mix of political provocation and entertainment.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1962 Robert Rauschenberg first used commercially produced silkscreens to make large-format paintings based on his own photographs and found-media images. These silkscreens may be considered an extension of the transfer drawings he executed between 1958 and 1962, in which he directly transferred the contents of newspapers and magazines onto sheets of paper. Since he could photographically enlarge imagery on the silkscreens, this process freed him from the scale restrictions of the transfer technique and allowed him to easily reuse images in varied contexts. He wrote in the spiral text on his lithograph Autobiography (1968) that he \"began silk screen paintings to escape familiarity of objects and collage.\"\nRauschenberg often worked in grisaille when experimenting in a new medium, and characteristically, the earliest silkscreened paintings are in black-and-white with resultant tones. By August 1963, however, he began to introduce brilliant color. These paintings, including Untitled (1963), best demonstrate the ways in which the artist exploited imperfections of the silkscreen process, such as subverting a perfect registry by not aligning the screens or by not using all of the colors in the four-color process (blue, red, yellow, and black). The gestural application of color in certain areas and the addition of found items (a technique reminiscent of his earlier Combines), like the metal and plastic objects in Untitled, assert the works' handmade nature. His pieces also include personal references. In Untitled, Merce Cunningham, with whom Rauschenberg had collaborated on theater and costume design since 1954, is the central image. The use of recognizable popular imagery and the application of a commercial technique led critics to identify Rauschenberg with other artists working in this idiom, including Andy Warhol, who also began to use the silkscreen process in his work at this time.\nJoan Young\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAd Reinhardts writings on art read as a litany of negative aphorisms. Describing his signature black paintings, which he focused on exclusively from 1953 until his death in 1967, he wrote: A free, unmanipulated, unmanipulatable, useless, unmarketable, irreducible, unphotographable, unreproducible, inexplicable icon. These canvasesmuted black squares containing barely discernable cruciform shapeschallenge the limits of visibility. Reinhardts strategy of denial echoed his conviction that Modernism itself was a negative progression, that abstraction evolved as a series of subtractions, and he was creating the last or ultimate paintings. Rather than forecasting the death of painting as a viable art form, however, Reinhardt was instead affirming paintings potential to transcend the contradictory rhetoric that surrounded it in contemporary criticism and the increasing commercial influences of the market. As art historian Yve-Alain Bois suggests in his study of the artist, what Reinhardt hoped to realize recalls the aspirations of Negation Theology, a method of thoughtevident in Platonism, Neo-Platonism, and early Christianityemployed to comprehend the Divine by indicating everything it was not. The artists attraction to the mystical side of negation arose from his appreciation of Eastern art and religion, namely the abstract, all-over patterning of Islamic design, the poetically reductive space of Chinese and Japanese landscape painting, and the meditative, ascetic quality of Zen Buddhism. The last he encountered through his friendship with the poet Thomas Merton, who was also a Trappist monk and authority on Zen. Reinhardt saw his own dark canvases, with their classic, geometric compositions, monastic repudiation of anything extraneous, and contemplative depth as a fusion of Eastern and Western traditions.However hermetic Reinhardts black paintings may seem, they were not created in a vacuum. The kind of profound, self-reflexive abstraction he advocated was partially a product of, and reaction to, the climate of Cold War America. Despite the iconoclasm of his aesthetic discourse, Reinhardt was actively engaged in political and social issues throughout his life. During the early 1940s, his editorial cartoons appeared in the leftist newspapers The New Masses and PM. Later, he participated in the antiwar movement, protesting against Americas involvement in Vietnam, and donated his work to benefits for civil rights activities. An aesthetic moralist, Reinhardt sought to create an art form thatin its monochromatic puritycould overcome the tyrannies of oppositional thinking.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAndy Warhol announced his disengagement from the process of aesthetic creation in 1963: I think somebody should be able to do all my paintings for me, he told art critic G.R. Swenson. The Abstract Expressionists had seen the artist as a heroic figure, alone capable of imparting his poetic vision of the world through gestural abstraction. Warhol, like other Pop artists, used found printed images from newspapers, publicity stills, and advertisements as his subject matter; he adopted silkscreening, a technique of mass reproduction, as his medium. And unlike the Abstract Expressionists, who searched for a spiritual pinnacle in their art, Warhol aligned himself with the signs of contemporary mass culture. His embrace of subjects traditionally considered debasedfrom celebrity worship to food labelshas been interpreted as both an exuberant affirmation of American culture and a thoughtless espousal of the low. The artists perpetual examination of themes of death and disaster suggest yet another dimension to his art.Warhol was preoccupied with news reports of violent deathsuicides, car crashes, assassinations, and executions. In the early 1960s he began to make paintings, such as Orange Disaster #5, with the serial application of images revolving around the theme of death. When you see a gruesome picture over and over again, he commented, it doesnt really have any effect. Yet Orange Disaster #5, with its electric chair repeated 15 times, belies this statement. Warhols painting speaks to the constant reiteration of tragedy in the media, and becomes, perhaps, an attempt to exorcise this image of death through repetition. However, it also emphasizes the pathos of the empty chair waiting for its next victim, the jarring orange only accentuating the horror of the isolated seat in a room with a sign blaring SILENCE.Warhols death and disaster pictures underscore the importance of the vanitas themethat death will take us allin his oeuvre. Self-Portrait, one of the last self-portraits Warhol painted before his death, may be considered the anxious meditation of an aging artist. (Other works he painted in his final year include a posthumous portrait of Joseph Beuys, who died in 1986, and a rendition of Leonardo da Vincis Last Supper.) The monumental scale of Self-Portrait suggests that Warhols obsession with celebrity encompassed himself. Yet unlike nearly all of his portraits, which commonly include the sitters neck and shoulders, this otherworldly image presents the artist as spectral, his acid green, disembodied head like a skull looming out of the black background.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

Trained in goldsmithing, Arnaldo Pomodoro combines the meticulous approach and skill of the craftsman with the techniques and aims of the caster of large-scale bronzes. His sculpture, cast from plasters of clay originals, contrasts the intricate detailing of jewelry with geometric breadth and clarity.Using the basic shapes of cube, cylinder, and sphere, he tears open their pristine, highly polished surfaces to reveal the internal structure of form. Underneath the gleaming skin and solid flesh of the bronze lies a regulating machinery of cogs and gears, which Pomodoro calls sign systems, akin to the complex interlocking systems of language or of organic bodies. The sphere not only functions as a geometric shape and analogue of a living body or mineral form, but also suggests the globe of the earth. The equatorial rupture produces configurations suggesting land masses, and evokes the earths core and desiccated ocean beds. By eliminating frontality, Pomodoro invites the viewer to circle the globe, conveying a sense of uninterrupted rotational movement imitating the orbit of planets.Lucy Flint\r\n        ",

This work, dedicated to the great 20th-century French colorist, is composed of a single fixture with four fluorescent lamps, set vertically against the wall. The spectrum of pink, yellow, blue, and green represents the four principle colors of commercial fluorescent light that Flavin deployed throughout his work. Sequenced in this way, the colors are arranged through simple modular repetition, a neutral approach to composition commonly associated with Minimalism. Yet fluorescent light also allowed Flavin to mix colors, making his work intensely optical: shown together, pink, yellow, blue, and green produce, surprisingly, a whitish glow.  Ted Mann\n",

Her hand-drawn arrangement of coordinates shifts in scale and rhythm between works; the resulting geometry is never mechanical and often in opposition to the square canvas.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1964, at New Yorks Green Gallery, Robert Morris exhibited a suite of large-scale polyhedron forms constructed from 2 x 4s and gray-painted plywood. This kind of simple geometric sculpture came to be called Minimalist because it seemed to be stripped of extraneous distractions such as figural or metaphorical reference, detail or ornament, and even surface inflection. Sculptures like the Untitled (Corner Piece), one component of the 1964 suite, boldly delineate the space in which they are located, thus defining the physical and temporal relationship of the viewer to the sculptural object.Morriss sculptures often consist of industrial or building materials such as steel, fiberglass, and plywood, and were commercially fabricated according to the artists specifications. The value of the artists handthe unique gesture that defines an individuals skill and stylewas inimical to Morris, and the work of art became, in theory, not an original object but a representation of the idea from which it was conceived. This notion allowed for the creation and destruction of a piece when necessary; Untitled (Corner Piece), for example, can be refabricated each time it is to be exhibited.In 1968 Morris introduced an entirely different aesthetic approach, which he articulated in an essay entitled Anti-Form. In this and later writings he reassessed his assumptions underlying Minimalist art and concluded that, contrary to earlier assertions, the construction of such objects had relied on subjective decisions and therefore resulted in iconsmaking them essentially no different than traditional sculpture. The art that he, Eva Hesse, Richard Serra, and others began to explore at the end of the 1960s stressed the unusual materials they employedindustrial components such as wire, rubber, and feltand their response to simple actions such as cutting and dropping. Untitled (Pink Felt) (1970), for example, is composed of dozens of sliced pink industrial felt pieces that have been dropped unceremoniously on the floor. Morriss scattered felt strips obliquely allude to the human body through their response to gravity and epidermal quality. The ragged irregular contours of the jumbled heap refuse to conform to the strict unitary profile that is characteristic of Minimalist sculpture. This, along with its growing referentiality, led Morriss work of the late-1960s and early 1970s to be referred to by such terms as Anti-Form, Process art, or Post-Minimalism.Jennifer Blessing\n",

Greenberg discussed the basic tenets of this mode of paintingnamely, an emphasis on openness and clarity that built on Jackson Pollocks earlier all-over drip worksin an essay for his 1964 Los Angeles County Museum exhibition Post Painterly Abstraction, which included the work of Kenneth Noland and his friend Morris Louis. The two artists, who were both based in Washington, D.C., had begun to explore the essential qualities of color and surface in the early 1950s following a visit to the New York studio of Helen Frankenthaler, who was one of Greenbergs most favored proteges at that time. Their encounter with her first soak-stain painting Mountains and Sea (1952), inspired them to experiment with the stain technique. Following their trip to New York, Noland and Louis worked in close proximity for several weeks before ultimately establishing their own personal approaches to fusing color with unprimed, unsized canvas. While Louis poured, Noland adhered to the more traditional brush and roller to apply his paint. In spite of these differences in technique, the two artists have historically been linked under the banners of both Post-painterly abstraction and Color Field painting.Starting in the early 1950s, Noland began producing a number of series, each of which explores a range of shapes and color arrangements and remains committed to his staining method as a means of overcoming the tactility of the canvas support with the opticality of pure color. Like Frankenthaler and Louis, Noland experimented with thinned, acrylic-based paints, which made it nearly impossible to revise or modify colors after the paint had penetrated the (unprimed) surface. To stress the care needed to execute these works, he referred to them as one-shot paintings.In 1963 Noland began a series focused on the chevron, or V-shape. Characterized by triangular bands of color pointed toward the bottom of the picture plane, this body of work provided an ideal means to experiment with the relationship between the painted image and its canvas support. In the earliest paintings on this theme, the entire surface is filled with paint, with the tip of the chevroncentred on the axis of symmetryoccasionally reaching past the edge of the picture plane. However, Noland soon began to leave areas surrounding the chevrons untouched, juxtaposing painted and unpainted surfaces to draw attention to the fusion of color and material. In 1964, with works such as Trans Shift, he started to de-centre the composition, pulling the tip of the chevron away from the line of symmetry, but maintaining the top edge of the support as the base of the shape. In shifting away from the centre, Noland could emphasize the tension between bounded and unbounded space.An early and classic example of Nolands offset chevron works, the large-scale Trans Shift requires prolonged viewing for the eye to take in its watery, acrylic colors and subtle structural details. By disrupting the two large blue bands with a single, bright green band and a small blue-green triangle at the chevrons origincolors seen often in the artists work of the 1960sNoland produces a tension between wholeness and fragmentation, flatness and recession.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMark Tobeys animated matrices of brushed line, like the mature works of Jackson Pollock, are allover compositions. That is, unlike conventional representational paintings, they have no discernable center of focus, no single emphasized portion. Even Cubist works maintain vestiges of pictorial illusionism through an increased density of form at their centers. Yet in viewing a work such as Advance of History, the eye moves easily from edge to edge without halting at any particular configuration, dipping, plunging, swirling, and doubling back to pursue the network of dynamic strokes that expand and breathe on the white surface of the paper. The support thus becomes but a portion of a composition that seems to extend beyond the physical limitations of edges or frames. As Tobey wrote, I have sought to make my painting whole but to attain this I have used a whirling mass. I take up no definite position.1Although the development of allover compositions in abstract painting is often associated with Pollock, Tobey in fact exhibited works without compositional focus or orientation as early as 1944, two years before Pollock made his first allover painting. In 1935 Tobey introduced his white writing, the characteristic network of white line that covers the surfaces of his works. This innovation followed Tobeys discovery of Oriental traditions of ink brushwork in China and Japan, where he found himself freed from form by the influence of the calligraphic.2 The spontaneity and energy conveyed in his first white writing compositions is still evident in the Peggy Guggenheim work, executed nearly thirty years later. But the frenetic impulses of line in early examples, such as Broadway Norm of 1935, have subsided into the more intricate and delicate fabric of lines of varying widths, densities, and color of Advance of History.Elizabeth C.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1963 Roy Lichtenstein defended Pop art against its critics, contending that there are certain things that are usable, forceful, and vital about commercial art. By choosing comic-book illustrations as a theme, and using simulated Benday dots to suggest cheap printing, Lichtenstein acknowledged (and perhaps questioned) the role of this popular form of entertainment in daily life. There is also an element of humor in creating fine art out of what has customarily been considered low, a playfulness that is equally evident in the onomatopoeic caption and bellicose expression of the dog in Grrrrrrrrrrr!! (1965)Lichtenstein cultivated imagery from the history of art while continuing to use the conventions of comics and advertisements. In Preparedness (1968) he used the Benday-dot technique to make a wall-size painting (10 feet high by 18 feet wide) that suggests the work of Fernand Leger and the WPA artists of the 1930s, who painted monumental murals, readable at a distance, on themes of workers and everyday life. Lichtenstein followed this practice to an ironic and somewhat subversive end. Painted during a year when public opinion on the Vietnam War shifted dramatically, Lichtensteins massive depiction of machinery and soldiers probes the conventions of selling the promises of the military-industrial complex, while quietly alluding to the naive optimism underlying a call to arms.Lichtenstein often focused on the way his traditional and mass-media sources resolve the dilemmas of representing three dimensions on a flat picture plane, incorporating their solutions into his own work with witty exaggeration. Preparedness plays the fragmented Cubist collage space of Leger against comic-strip modes of suggesting form and the surface quality of objects. Lichtensteins inclusion of an airplane window in the third panel of the painting foreshadows his engagement with modes of conveying the illusion of reflective glass, which he went on to explore in a series of paintings of mirrors. Interior with Mirrored Wall (1991) is a later development of this exploration. In a series of works depicting banal domestic environments inspired by furniture ads he found in telephone books, Lichtenstein continued his previous investigations of illusionistic representational devices, here by including the eponymous mirrored wall and the gleaming, polished grand piano. His references to high-art sources included his own work, which is shown framed on the wall. The floor covering also implicitly acknowledges Henri Matisses use of decorative patterns.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe latest of Pablo Picassos works in the Guggenheims Thannhauser Collection, Lobster and Cat attests to the artists unbroken creative energy during the last years of his life. The painting demonstrates Picassos ability to derive serious implications from what is essentially humorous. The subject of the lobster and cat refers to one of the most beloved paintings of French art, Jean-Baptiste-Simeon Chardins The Ray (1728, Musee du Louvre, Paris). In both paintings, a cat is aroused to vicious hissing by the menacing aspect of an item of seafood that is as delicious to the palate as it is horrendous to the eye.What is so astonishing in Picassos painting is that he is able to retain the humorously anecdotal premise of the eighteenth-century genre painting while simultaneously heightening the encounter between cat and lobster into a miniature but extremely effective metaphor of aggression aroused by fear. It is a theme that preoccupied Picasso. If one makes all due allowances for the differences between the categories of miniature and monumental expression, it is a theme that also occurs in Picassos great mural Guernica (1937, Reina Sofia, Madrid). The comparison strikes an absurd note until one remembers Picassos frequent shifts from monumental to miniature, from trifling to significant and back again. These ostensibly erratic whimsicalities aim at an ironic demonstration of the artificial conventions of our thought and of our feelings. Here again, as in Lobster and Cat and in so much of Picassos work, it is impossible to think of Guernicas bull or horse as being either all good or all evil, so is it impossible (on quite a different level of seriousness, of course) to come to a clear decision regarding the lobster and the cat in the Thannhauser painting. Both animals are potentially as innocent as they are dangerous.Fred Licht\r\n        ",

Following the example set by Julio Gonzalez and Pablo Picasso, who created welded-steel sculptures as early as 1928, the Americans constructed their work directly out of iron and steel sheets and wires rather than employing the traditional method of casting. In the 1930s and 1940s, influenced by Surrealism and Constructivism, Smith created hybrid figural sculptures and dramatic mise-en-scenes. During the 1950s he began to work in stylistic series ranging from the complicated abstract drawings-in-space of the Agricolas to the anthropomorphic and totemic sculptures incorporating machine parts such as the Sentinels and Tank Totems. In the later part of the decade and into the 1960s his work became more volumetric and monolithic.Smith completed 28 works in his last series of monumental abstract structures, the Cubis, before his death in May 1965. These celebrated sculptures were composed from a repertoire of geometric cubes and cylinders of varying proportions. All of the Cubis are made of stainless steel, which Smith burnished to a highly reflective surface. He told critic Thomas Hess, I made them and I polished them in such a way that on a dull day they take on a dull blue, or the color of the sky in the late afternoon sun, the glow, golden like the rays, the colors of nature.Some of the Cubis are vaguely figural, while others, such as Cubi XXVII, suggest architecture. This example is one of three Cubis usually referred to as Gates (although Smith called them arches), which rise like giant rudimentary doorways framing a central void. By counterbalancing a cylinder that appears to rest precariously on edge with two small tilted blocks that look equally unstable, Smith emphasized the potential energy captured through the welding technique. The artist activated the surface of the structure through the curling traces left by the polishing process, creating, in his words, a structure that can face the sun and hold its own against the blaze and the power.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nFrom 1942 to 1947 Jesus Rafael Soto studied at the Escuela de artes plasticas in Caracas, Venezuela, where the curriculum focused on figurative art. His encounter with a Cubist still life by Georges Braque introduced him to a reductive, geometric approach to art, and by the late 1940s Soto was producing painterly canvases that had both formal and coloristic affinities with Cubism.\nIn 1950 he left his post as director of the Escuela de artes plasticas in Maracaibo, Venezuela, and relocated to Paris. Soon afterward, he traveled to Holland to see a large body of Kazimir Malevich's and Piet Mondrian's work. Soto had already undertaken a close study of the Dutch artist's progressive exploration of abstractionfrom his early Cubist tree series to his iconic grids. Like Alexander Calder 20 years earlier, Soto wanted to dynamize Mondrian's art. He felt it was extremely important to move beyond the stasis of two-dimensional paintings as well as the illusionism that dominated geometric abstraction in the 1940s and 1950s. \r\nIn order to realize his concept of abstract art as pure structure and idea, Soto borrowed from the fields of mathematics and music. He used the mathematical concepts of repetition and progressionwhich contradicted the intuitive, subjective approach then in vogue and known in Europe as Art Informelin paintings of geometric elements repeated across the picture plane and then in a series based on the square. Serial music also served as a guide, suggesting the potential for infinite variation through the codification of basic colors into a serial system. Soto superposed and methodically distributed colored dots and later geometrical elements on Plexiglas sheets in an effort to generate the optical impression of movement. He soon discovered that he could increase the impression of visual vibration by arranging the sheets at a distance from one another and by using a spiral as one of his principal forms. He displayed some of these kinetic structures in the historic 1955 exhibition Le mouvement (The Movement) at the Galerie Denise Rene, which helped to establish him as a leading artist in the emerging kinetic and optical art movement.\nShortly thereafter, Soto began a series called Vibrations (Vibraciones) consisting of a wooden panel covered with thin, vertical, parallel lines painted in black and white, which were juxtaposed with pieces of wood, wires, or other common objects. In works such as Vibration (Vibracion, 1965), a sensation of movement is generated when the viewer looks at the patterned ground in relation to the metal squares. In contrast to Vibrations made with thin metal rods, which lose their individual character and seem almost to disappear before the striped background, here the squares maintain their form. The physical distance between them and the support remains difficult to gauge, and the squares appear to float in space. Their edges look as though they are flickering. Soto's emphasis on continuous, dynamic optical transformation rather than the art object itself is in keeping with his goal of stressing the concept of dematerialization. For Soto, \"the immaterial is the sensory reality of the universe. Art is the sensory knowledge of the immaterial. To become conscious of the immaterial in its state of pure structure, is to make the final leap towards the absolute.\"1\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nWalter De Maria is best known for his 1977 Lightning Field. A rectangular grid in New Mexico measuring one mile by one kilometer and containing 400 stainless-steel lightning rods, it serves as an arena for observing meteorological activity. The artist also endeavored to bring such ordered experiences of the landscape into the gallery, translating distance, measure, and nature into abstract tableaux known as Earthrooms, in which accretions of soil, rocks, gravel, or peat fill the floors of architectural structures. De Marias reputation as an Environmental artistlinking him with Michael Heizer, Nancy Holt, and Robert Smithsonacknowledges only one facet of his challenging oeuvre. Less appreciated is De Marias early association with Fluxus and performance in San Francisco prior to his arrival in New York in 1960. From his exposure to the work of composer La Monte Young and dancer Simone Forti, among others, De Maria developed an interest in task-oriented, gamelike projects that resulted in viewer-interactive sculptures. For example, his Boxes for Meaningless Work (1961) is inscribed with the instructions, Transfer things from one box to the next box back and forth, back and forth, etc. Be aware that what you are doing is meaningless. The artist retained a participatory component, but only metaphorically, in his small-scale, polished-aluminum floor sculptures in shapes that possess significant iconic impactthe cross, the six-pointed star, and the swastika. The hollow interiors of the sculptures form narrow channels containing metal spheres. By including these seemingly movable balls, De Maria again evoked the notion of game-playing, but given the narrative association of the symbols, it seems an ironic gesture.Conceived of separately, but now often exhibited together, Cross, Star, and Museum Piece manifest how ancient symbolic configurations have undergone various interpretive transmutations: the cross, mark of Christianity, has also been discovered on ancient Egyptian tombs; the six-pointed star, sign of Judaism, first appeared on Bronze and Iron Age relics; and the swastika, emblem of Nazism, was once representative of prosperity, regeneration, and goodwill. By titling the swastika Museum Piece, De Maria seems also to have been commenting on the neutralizing effects of the museum environment, in which cultural artifacts, removed from their original contexts, can be reduced to visual equivalences.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nComing after the dominance of Abstract Expressionism during the immediate postwar era, by the 1960s artists sought to create a different kind of art that was not premised on self-expression or subjectivity. Described as Minimalists, many figures of this generation embraced an aesthetic of reduction as a way of countering painterly illusionism. Often this took the form of sculpture, as in the work of Donald Judd and Robert Morris, who strove to create geometric sculptures that referred to nothing outside of the objects themselves. Jo Baer addressed similar concerns on canvas and came to be recognized as among the most radical abstract painters of the time.\nHorizontals Flanking, Large, Green Line (1966) is one of a group of paired canvases with similar visual elements that differ in color and orientation. Here, the title indicates two panels with a landscape orientation (thus Horizontals), which are hung next to one another (hence Flanking). The work features an expansive white field bounded on the edges by a black line and a green line. Baer built up the white ground with oil and acrylic to achieve a flat, even surface, and created the bands around the edges with oil paint using tapes and rulers, finishing them with a small brush by hand. \nBaer was keenly interested in the optical processes of perception. In 1970, she published Art and Vision: Mach Bands in the multimedia arts magazine Aspen. The article uses scientific research to discuss the power of borders and contrast in visual perception, and urges artists to take advantage of the mechanics of vision. The term Mach bands specifically refers to the physicist Ernst Machs observation that where a dark field meets a light field, the viewer perceives the illusion of two bandsa light band in the dark field and a dark band in the light field. In Horizontals Flanking, Large, Green Line, the slim strip of green dividing the black band from the white field exaggerates this effect. Baers essay also discusses contrast enhancement, in which a color will appear brighter at its border if bounded by white or blackhence the intensity of the green in this case. Perceptual effects also contribute to the paintings curious play between infinite space and finite space: if the viewer alternates his or her focus, the white ground shifts between appearing like unbounded space behind the painted frame or a concentrated field bounded by its border.\nWhen the Guggenheim Museum acquired Baers painting in 1968, it was the first major purchase of her work by a museum. Similar work by Baer had been included in Lawrence Alloways landmark Systemic Painting show at the Guggenheim in 1966.\nDiana Kamin\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nPrior to the 20th century, artists did not work directly in metal as a sculptural medium. Rather, they carved plaster and molded clay originals that were subsequently cast at a foundry by expert craftsmen. Thus, the sculpture of Eduardo Chillida, comprised of abstract forms created through pounding and bending steel, represents a quintessentially modern approach. Chillida considers his materials not as a vehicle for representation but as an inherent part of the work's total conception and form. His way of working is characteristic of his native region, but it also has roots in the art of Julio Gonzalez, who is generally regarded as having made the initial breakthrough to direct metal sculpture in the late 1920s.\nExecuted with a heroic sense of scale and a tremendous sensitivity for mass, space, and materials, Chillida's abstract sculpture is well in keeping with the tachiste sensibility of late 1940s and 1950s art. Accentuating the work's physical properties, the surface of Three Irons (Iru Burni, 1966) is raw and pitted by acid. As the viewer considers the work from various angles, the interrelationships of the interlocking steel limbs in space seem to change. Chillida's interest in volumetric forms may stem, in part, from his early training in architecture. His first welded metal sculptures were relatively delicate and in keeping with a Cubist language of linear forms. But he soon developed a technique that seems to reference the Spanish tradition of forged ironwork, which had been particularly strong in the Basque provinces and Catalonia.\nDuring the 1960s, Chillida heightened the scale of his works and executed a series of public commissions. This experience of working monumentally informs his works in all scales, so that even the relatively small Three Irons possesses a majestic sense of structure.\nIngrid Schaffner\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nEmploying only commercial fluorescent lights in his work, Dan Flavin devised a radical new art form that circumvented the limits imposed by frames, pedestals, or other conventional means of display. His embrace of the unadorned fluorescent fixture as an aesthetic object placed him at the forefront of a generation of artists whose use of industrial materials, emphasis on elementary forms, and nonhierarchical relationships among component parts became the salient characteristics of Minimalism.The additive composition of the nominal three (to William of Ockham), dedicated to the 14th-century English philosopher, exemplifies Flavins use of the fluorescent tube as a basic building block. The artists installations became increasingly complex while remaining bound to the limited palette and standard lengths in which the fixtures were commercially produced. His subsequent development of a vocabulary of corners, barriers, and corridors engaged the environment his work occupied and revealed his interest in reconceptualizing sculpture in relation to space. The first of his barrier pieces, greens crossing greens (to Piet Mondrian who lacked green), transforms and even inverts the conventional museum experience by literally invading the viewers space and prohibiting access to the gallery. The reference to Mondrian is in keeping with Flavins practice of dedicating individual works to family, friends, or historical figures of significance to him.The artist Mel Bochner credited Flavins practice as embodying an acute awareness of the phenomenology of rooms. This awareness stemmed from Flavins rejection of studio production in favor of site-specific situations or proposals (as the artist preferred to classify his work) and is nowhere more evident than in his 1971 installation for the Guggenheim, untitled (to Ward Jackson, an old friend and colleague who, during the Fall of 1957 when I finally returned to New York from Washington and joined him to work together in this museum, kindly communicated). Initially occupying one full turn of the museums ramps, and according to the artist, critically fitted to the inconsistent dimensions of the variable architecture, the work was conceived so that it could be extended to fill the entire rotunda, as was done in 1992. At that time, Flavin incorporated untitled (to Ward Jackson . . . ) into an new work dedicated to his fiancee, untitled (to Tracy, to celebrate the love of a lifetime), which featured a column rising from the rotunda floor in a celebratory manner, suffusing the space with a warm pink glow. Together these installations amplified the Frank Lloyd Wright interior, exemplifying Flavins career-long concern with light, space, and color.J. Fiona Ragheb\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nJoan Miro met ceramicist Josep Llorens Artigas in 1912, while Miro was an art student in Barcelona. These longtime friends began to work together in 1944. Miro's initial experiments in the medium of ceramics were collaborative pieces in which he painted on the surfaces of Artigas's vase and plaque forms. Eventually Miro began to produce sculpture in the medium, making models out of found objects and natural materials that would then be translated into clay by Artigas or, beginning in 1953, by Artigas's son Joan.\nAlicia (196567) is Miro's second ceramic mural in the United States, following a 1950 public painting commission for Harvard's Graduate Center that was replaced in 1960 with a more durable ceramic version. Executed at Artigas's atelier near Barcelona, Alicia is comprised of 190 separate ceramic tiles and is permanently installed in the rotunda of the Guggenheim's Frank Lloyd Wright building, obscured by the first wall encountered as one ascends the museum's spiral ramp. Thomas M. Messer, the Guggenheim Museum's director from 1961 to 1988, contacted Miro in 1963 following the proposal of Harry F. Guggenheim, then president of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, to commission an appropriate memorial to Guggenheim's wife, Alicia Patterson Guggenheim, who died that year at the age of 56.\nThe abstract composition, typical of Miro's characteristic style, palette, and vocabulary of motifs, includes the name \"Alice\" in reference to the commemorated Alicia Guggenheim. Although Messer tactfully attempted to correct the misspelling, the artist mysteriously resisted. Amid his signature celestial forms, Miro perhaps playfully settled on a composition of letters that, as was suggested in a 1967 letter from his dealer Pierre Matisse, could be read either as \"Alice\" or \"Alicia.\"\nMiro undertook the project with enthusiasm, writing to Messer in August of 1966 and noting the significance he ascribes to the firing process in the completion of his ceramic works: \"I am delighted to tell you that the great mural has already been started. I am very hopeful about the results of this first stage. Let's hope that our great friend Fire will also bring us his richness and his beauty for the next steps.\"1 Possibly it was the element of chance interaction, producing uncontrolled and unexpected results that drew the Surrealist Miro to the techniques for creating works in ceramics, a medium that remained significant in his oeuvre for over four decades. \r\n\r\nTracey Bashkoff\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nWith his keen eye for contour, Ellsworth Kelly extracts visual fragments from the surrounding worldthe sweeping curve of a Romanesque nave, a crescent moon, a barred windowand then condenses them into elemental colors and shapes. Although relentlessly abstract, his forms are anchored to the legible, to details of architecture or landscape, filtered through the artists vision. Early in his career, Kelly adopted a philosophy of anti-illusionism that would change the parameters of painting and revise its relationship to sculpture. He began painting monochrome panels in the early 1950s and has been experimenting with this composition (or anticomposition) ever since in single and multipanel formats. With their anonymous, uninflected technique and absence of surface drawing, these pristine painting-objects established a new relationship between painting and its architectural context. By defining the structure and shape of each canvas through colormatte, uniform, and without gestural nuanceKelly eliminated any figure-ground illusion and brought painting into the sculptural realm of objects; the painting itself became the figure, with the wall as its ground.Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red exemplifies Kellys lucid, forthright style. Five monochrome panels are arranged in the order of the chromatic spectrum, the primary colors balanced by their intermediary values of green and orange. The concentrated colors are charged by their interaction with each other, and the works sizemonumental, yet at a human scale by virtue of its breakdown into vertical panelsfurther strengthens its presence. Dark Blue Curve signals Kellys longtime interest in shaped canvases. It is this focus on peripheral shape identified by color that makes his paintings sculptural, engaging directly with their own forms and the walls around them. The shaped monochromes reinforce the anti-illusionistic project begun with Kellys rectangular panels; unframed and unmarked save for their color, they are a more emphatic denial of the window-onto-the-world view of the traditional four-sided easel painting. Wright Curve, a steel sculpture designed for permanent installation in the Guggenheims Peter B. Lewis Theater, is named after the museums architect, Frank Lloyd Wright. Its affinity with the palette and geometry of the auditorium shows the artists interest in encouraging site-specific experiences of his painting and sculpture. For Kelly, the transition between the two mediums is fluid: sculpture for me is something Ive brought off the wall.Bridget Alsdorf\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn his 1969 essay Art After Philosophy, artist and theoretician Joseph Kosuth argued that traditional art-historical discourse had reached its end. In its place he proposed a radical investigation of the means through which art acquires its cultural significance and its status as art. Being an artist now, commented Kosuth, means to question the nature of art. If one is questioning the nature of painting, one cannot be questioning the nature of art . . . Thats because the word art is general and the word painting is specific. Painting is a kind of art. If you make paintings you are already accepting (not questioning) the nature of art.During this formative stage in his work, Kosuth made the tautological nature of art explicit. As an analytical proposition, art presupposes the existence of an aesthetic entity that fulfills the criteria of artness. This criteria, as Marcel Duchamp proved with his readymades, could consist merely of the declaration this is a work of art. Kosuth used this linguistic approach to explore the social, political, cultural, and economic contexts through which art is presented and thus defined. To demonstrate this discursive aspect of art, Kosuth employed language itself as his medium. What resulted was a rigorously Conceptual art devoid of all morphological presence; intellectual provocation replaced perception as words displaced images and objects. This shift was signaled in Kosuths First Investigations (subtitled Art as Idea as Idea), a series that includes photostats of dictionary definitions of words such as water, meaning, and idea. Accompanying these photographic images are certificates of documentation and ownership (not for display) indicating that the works can be made and remade for exhibition purposes. This strategy of presentation represents Kosuths attempt to undermine the preciousness of the unique art object and its privileged place in the museum. He sought to demonstrate that the art component is not located in the object itself but rather in the idea or concept of the work.Along with other Conceptual artists Kosuth waged an attack on conventional aesthetics that has informed the strategies of a younger generation. From Kosuths initial enterprise, these artists have inherited a deconstructive approach to art in which a critique of the production of meaning takes precedence over the communication of meaning.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

With the aid of a compass, the artist translated these outlines into regular geometric forms.

By dividing the painting vertically into separate panels, Mangold further counteracts the illusion of depth and calls attention to the works physical support.

Fueled by an interest in the Abstract Expressionist work he saw during trips to New York in the early 1960s, Marden stated at the time that he was making highly emotional paintings not to be admired for any technical or intellectual reason but to be felt.1 His early single-color panels such as Private Title (1966) reconcile the stringent subtractions of Minimalism with his more expressive impulses as a painter. On close inspection, Mardens matte canvases, layered with thick encaustic (his characteristic oil-and-wax technique), reveal the marks of the palette knife, the subtle ridges in the viscous material inflecting each panels uniform color and opacity with impressions of the painters working process. This evidence of the artists hand, along with his anachronistic tendency toward the lyrical, is what distinguishes his work from that of his Minimalist contemporaries known for a reliance on a cool, industrial quality.\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nRichard Serra created Beltstangled clusters of vulcanized rubber strips illuminated by an erratic curl of neon tubingshortly after returning from a year of study in Italy, where he undoubtedly witnessed the very beginnings of Arte Povera. Like the artists who would come to be associated with that movement, Serra employed nontraditional materials in his sculpture, in this case belts suspended from hooks on the wall. The pieces anthropomorphic qualitythe belts suggest limp figures or twisted harnessesindicates that Serra was also familiar with contemporaneous sculptural reflections on the human body made by Eva Hesse and Bruce Nauman. Serras style would change radically in the ensuing years, but his sensitivity to the body, its capacity for action, and its crucial role in perception has remained a constant in the work.Serra envisions sculpture as the physical manifestation of transitive verbs. In 1967 and 1968 he compiled a list of infinitives that served as catalysts for subsequent work: to hurl suggested the hurling of molten lead into crevices between wall and floor; to roll led to the rolling of the material into dense, metal logs. While the process of fabricating these pieces was, in essence, their very subject, Serra eventually deemed them too picturesque and he shifted strategies once again. Continuing his employment of lead, Serra utilized another transitive verb: to prop. Right Angle Prop is one of numerous lead constructions, the assemblage of which is dependent on leaning elements. Dispensing with carving and weldingconventional methods of delineating volume and securing massSerra created precarious sculptures that stand by virtue of equilibrium and gravity. Such pieces exist in a constant state of tension, ever revealing the process of their making, ever threatening to tilt off balance. Following the perilous choreography of propping, Serra engaged the verb to cut in a series of large-scale steel sculptures, variations of which he is still producing. Strike is essentially one tall, thin steel slice that, wedged into a corner, bisects the room and demands viewing from both sides. As one walks around the front of the piece, perception continually shifts: plane gives way to edge to plane again. This cut-steel sculpture is itself an implement for cutting space and, in this way, serves as an analogue for the sculptor himself, who stimulates vision by giving material form to the transitive verb.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

In addition to Hollywood starlets such as Lauren Bacall and Greta Garbo, Cornell was infatuated with Victorian-era ballerinas, actresses, and opera divas. Pairing the obsessive voyeurism of a fan with the skill of an archivist, Cornell collected photographs, newspaper clippings, and memorabilia, as well as small objects with real or invented histories, and accumulated them in files and boxes in his basement studio. These artifacts became source material for Cornells signature three-dimensional box-constructions and collages, such as Duse, which features Italian stage actress Eleonora Duse. Cornell had been fascinated with her since seeing her perform in an Ibsen play in the early 1920s. This collage is one of two nearly identical works entering the collection that employ the same 19th-century photograph, which the artist mounted on board and most likely manipulated to add to its aged appearance. In the second collage, Cornell applied pink watercolor, suggestive of lipstick, to the edges of the image, adding to its poignancy as a record of his nostalgic and deeply romantic longing for the unattainable.Ted Mann\r\n\r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, Frank Stella broke the stronghold of Abstract Expressionism with his deceptively simple paintings of black stripes separated by narrow lines of unpainted canvas. With their emphasis on control and rationalism, the Black Paintings opened genuinely new paths for abstraction and exerted a profound influence on the art of the 1960s. A major shift from this work began to develop in 1966 with his Irregular Polygons, canvases in the shapes of irregular geometric forms and characterized by large unbroken areas of color. As this new vocabulary developed into a more open and color-oriented pictorial language, the works underwent a metamorphosis in size, expressing an affinity with architecture in their monumentality. Stella also introduced curves into his works, marking the beginning of the Protractor series. Harran II evinces the great vaulting compositions and lyrically decorative patterns that are the leitmotif of the series, which is based on the semicircular drafting instrument used for measuring and constructing angles.Most of the paintings titles are taken from the names of ancient cities in Asia Minor. A Roman numeral following the title indicates which of three design groupsinterlaces, rainbows, or fansencompasses its surface patterning. Harran II is composed of a full circle formed of two vertical protractors, each of which interlocks with a horizontal protractor shape. In turn, each protractor-shaped area contains eight concentric circular bandsthe rainbowsthat articulate the surface of the canvas.Although the dominant motifs of the Protractor series are circular or curvilinear, every shape is actually defined by pairs of horizontal and vertical lines that intersect at right angles; the gridded rectilinear pattern that is formed is superimposed over the decor-ative arcs. Through the device of the protractor and the use of almost psychedelic colora combination of acrylic and fluorescent pigmentsStella brought abstraction and decorative pattern painting into congruence in a manner that challenged the conventions of both traditions.Jan Avgikos\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nManipulating light as a sculptor would mold clay, James Turrell creates works that amplify perception. Unlike pictorial art that replicates visual experience through mimetic illusion, Turrells light worksone cannot call these shimmering events objects or imagesgive form to perception. Each installation activates a heightened sensory awareness that promotes discovery: what seems to be a lustrous, suspended cube is actually the conjunction of two flat panels of projected light; a rectangle of radiant color hovering in front of a wall is really a deep, illuminated depression in the space; a velvety black square on the ceiling is, in reality, a portal to the night sky. With such effects, Turrell hopes to coax the viewer into a state of self-reflexivity in which one can see oneself seeing.\nTurrell has consistently utilized the sparest formal means to perpetuate the consciousness of perception. As demonstrated by the projected geometric cube of Afrum I, in which light creates the illusion of volume, the artists work derives its power from simplicity. Turrells early inquiries into the psychological implications of perception involved sensory deprivation. In 1968 he participated in the Art &amp; Technology program at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. With scientist Edward Wortz, who was investigating the perceptual alterations encountered in space travel, he studied the visual indeterminacy of the Ganzfeldan optical phenomenon in which there is nothing for the eye to focus onwith the goal of observing his own retinal activity.\nSuch phenomena are manifest in works involving structural cuts into existing architecture that allow outside light to penetrate and inhabit interior realms. Lunette is an opening to the sky at the end of a barrel-vaulted hall flanked by hidden fluorescent lights that accentuate the nuanced tones of dawn and dusk. Skyspace I (1974) is a square room with a large square aperture in the ceiling, in which the sky is framed by a narrow margin of white ceiling. The low, concealed fluorescent lights and white-painted floor reflect and intensify the modulating light. These and all of Turrells skyspaces harken back to ancient building techniques that deployed natural lightand the cycles of the cosmosto create symbolic architecture. In other spatial interventions, such as Night Passage, Turrell uses wall partitions with rectangular windows opening onto contiguous areas filled with pure, colored light. Standing in what Turrell has called the sensing space, the viewer encounters a Ganzfeld, the volume of colored light on the other side of the partition collapsing into what appears to be a floating, luminous plane with no surface or depth. The illusion is destabilizing yet mesmerizing; it is a tangible example of the artists endeavor to produce sensations that are essentially prelingual, to create a transformative experience of wordless thought.\nNancy Spector\n",

In this regard, the work is closely related to Nauman's \"slabs\" (196768), a sequence of works, each of which takes the form of a metal plate or block similarly set directly on the ground and bearing a secretan inscription, for exampleon the underside. In all these works, Nauman engages yet undermines the literalism of Minimalist sculpture by introducing extrinsic content. Lighted Center Piece also incorporates elements that anticipate Nauman's larger installations. It has been observed, for example, that the work resembles a miniature, lighted stage set, and as such anticipates the way viewers are enlisted to \"perform\" in Nauman's large-scale rooms and corridors.1 More specifically, the blinding intensity of the light in Lighted Center Piece presages several constructed rooms, including Yellow Room (Triangular) (1973) in the Guggenheim Museum's collection, in which Nauman asks the viewer to enter a space of intense, highly discomforting yellow fluorescent light. Thwarted vision is a common theme in Nauman's works, one that is further engaged by Lighted Performance Box (1969, also in the collection), where the source of an intense, projected light is concealed inside a tall aluminum box.

Two years later, at the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, The Hague, Netherlands, Flavin erected an artificial barrier of blue, red, and blue (to Flavin Starbuck Judd). As in the previous work, the wall-to-wall structure obstructs the viewer's movement, reflecting Flavin's expanding engagement with the full space of a room. The dedication in the title is to Donald Judd's son (whose name attests to the close friendship between the two artists at this time). In 1970, a related, larger barrier with the same blue-and-red palette was installed on the top floor of Judd's home and studio on Spring Street in the city of New York.Flavin's \"corridors\" also control and impede the movement of the viewer through gallery space. They take various forms: some are bisected by two back-to-back rows of abutted fixtures, a divider that may be approached from either side but not penetrated (the color of the lamps differs from one side to the other). The first such corridor, untitled (to Jan and Ron Greenberg), was constructed for a 1973 solo exhibition at the St. Louis Art Museum, and is dedicated to a local gallerist and his wife. It is green and yellow; a gap (the width of a single \"missing\" fixture) reveals the cast glow of the color from beyond the divide. In subsequent barred corridors, Flavin would introduce regular spacing between the individual fixtures, thereby increasing the visibility of the light and allowing the colors to mix. Ted Mann\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the early 1960s Donald Judd abandoned painting, having recognized that actual space is intrinsically more powerful and specific than paint on a flat surface.1 His move into three dimensions was coincident with a growing acknowledgment among other artists of his generation of the physical environment as an integral aspect of an artwork. Minimalist sculpture broke with illusionistic conventions by translating compositional concerns into three dimensions, rendering the work a product of the exchange between the object, the viewer, and the environment.In his 1965 essay Specific Objects, Judd championed recent work that was neither painting nor sculpture by a diverse range of artists such as Lee Bontecou, Mark di Suvero, Claes Oldenburg, and Frank Stella. His endorsement of the thing as a whole rather than a composition of parts stemmed from what he saw as the strength and clarity asserted by singular forms, the unitary character of which resulted from the conflation of color, image, shape, and surface. Judds earliest freestanding sculptures were singular, boxlike forms constructed of wood or metal. The simple shape of Untitled (1968), with its slightly recessed upper surface, is readily intelligible as a whole and thus avoids the compositional effects that for Judd diluted a works power. As the artists exploration of three-dimensional space became more complex, his aversion to such effects was manifested in a number of strategies designed to subordinate a works individual components to the whole.Like the rectangular shape with which he began, Judds rows and progressions are legible systems that reoccur in his oeuvre. In its repetition of serial forms and spaces, the vertical stack of Untitled (1969) literally incorporates space as one of its materials along with highly polished copper, creating a play between positive and negative that coheres as a totality. Similarly, in Untitled (1970), the application of a dual Fibonacci progression (a mathematically based sequence in which each number is the sum of the two previous two: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and so on) imparts an internal logic to both solid and void alike, the anodized color of the boxes throwing the mathematical system into greater relief. While spatial concerns were foremost for Judd, color and materials always remained central to his conception of art. Sustained and rigorous investigations of space and form, his project is tempered by a rich palette of industrial materials, such as stainless steel, aluminum, and translucent Plexiglas, the varied surfaces and finishes of which lend a sumptuous air to an otherwise austere undertaking.J.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1963 Roy Lichtenstein defended Pop art against its critics, contending that there are certain things that are usable, forceful, and vital about commercial art. By choosing comic-book illustrations as a theme, and using simulated Benday dots to suggest cheap printing, Lichtenstein acknowledged (and perhaps questioned) the role of this popular form of entertainment in daily life. There is also an element of humor in creating fine art out of what has customarily been considered low, a playfulness that is equally evident in the onomatopoeic caption and bellicose expression of the dog in Grrrrrrrrrrr!! (1965)Lichtenstein cultivated imagery from the history of art while continuing to use the conventions of comics and advertisements. In Preparedness (1968) he used the Benday-dot technique to make a wall-size painting (10 feet high by 18 feet wide) that suggests the work of Fernand Leger and the WPA artists of the 1930s, who painted monumental murals, readable at a distance, on themes of workers and everyday life. Lichtenstein followed this practice to an ironic and somewhat subversive end. Painted during a year when public opinion on the Vietnam War shifted dramatically, Lichtensteins massive depiction of machinery and soldiers probes the conventions of selling the promises of the military-industrial complex, while quietly alluding to the naive optimism underlying a call to arms.Lichtenstein often focused on the way his traditional and mass-media sources resolve the dilemmas of representing three dimensions on a flat picture plane, incorporating their solutions into his own work with witty exaggeration. Preparedness plays the fragmented Cubist collage space of Leger against comic-strip modes of suggesting form and the surface quality of objects. Lichtensteins inclusion of an airplane window in the third panel of the painting foreshadows his engagement with modes of conveying the illusion of reflective glass, which he went on to explore in a series of paintings of mirrors. Interior with Mirrored Wall (1991) is a later development of this exploration. In a series of works depicting banal domestic environments inspired by furniture ads he found in telephone books, Lichtenstein continued his previous investigations of illusionistic representational devices, here by including the eponymous mirrored wall and the gleaming, polished grand piano. His references to high-art sources included his own work, which is shown framed on the wall. The floor covering also implicitly acknowledges Henri Matisses use of decorative patterns.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe pursuit of new techniques has been a continuous theme of Robert Rauschenberg's work. During a trip to Cuba in spring 1952, the artist first experimented with transfer drawings, taking printed images, primarily from newspapers and magazines, placing them face down on sheets of paper, and then rubbing the backs of the images with an empty ballpoint pen or other burnishing device to transfer the original to the paper. The technique has been described as imparting a veiled quality, which the artist heightens by applying paint, pencil, and crayon marks over the transferred images. Yellow Body exemplifies a technical development in which Rauschenberg applied a chemical solvent, such as lighter fluid, to the preprinted image, facilitating a clearer and more complete transfer.Yellow Body demonstrates Rauschenberg's concentrated interest in the popular media and his practice of juxtaposing myriad recognizable images. The iconography of these works, which also recalls that of his early silkscreen paintings, includes modes of transportation, astronauts, athletes, and fragments of comic strips. Often an autobiographical reference will be part of this varied mix. Yellow Body includes images of fellow Port Arthur, Texas, native Janis Joplin (whom Rauschenberg met in 1968 at the New York nightclub Max's Kansas City) and Joplin's band, Big Brother and the Holding Company.After his move to rustic Captiva Island off the Gulf Coast of Florida in 1970, Rauschenberg's focus shifted from urban and pop culture to an abstract idiom. He adopted unconventional but generic materials, such as cardboard and fabric, reflecting his consistently innovative approach to art making. By altering their properties only slightly, the artist emphasized their inherent colors and textures. No longer employing either a hand or silkscreen process to transfer images, Rauschenberg now used an old Fuchs and Lang proofing press, which he had acquired shortly after his arrival in Captiva. The process not only transmitted visual texture but also a physical imprint. In the Hoarfrost series, Rauschenberg explored fabric as an unstretched support for imagery, applying the transfer process to such lustrous and diaphanous fabrics as silk, chiffon, and satin. These works, which are simply pinned to the wall, investigate the qualities of veiling and translucency as well as the natural draping quality of fabric first seen in the Combines such as Minutiae (1954) or Odalisk (1955/58), among others. As with many of Rauschenberg\u001es series, the earlier works have a relatively colorless palette, but more colorful and legible imagery was later developed.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1963, prompted by the proliferation of media-generated imagery in the contemporary landscape, Gerhard Richter and fellow artists Konrad Lueg (a.k.a. Konrad Fischer) and Sigmar Polke founded Capitalist Realism as a critique of consumer culture. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Richter continued to use media images to explore the relationship between painting and photography. Working in a wide range of approaches, from figuration and landscapes to gestural abstractions and monochromes, the artist has evaded the normative discourse of art history.Richter has stated, I am suspicious regarding the image of reality which our senses convey to us and which is incomplete and limited, and his insistence on the illusionistic nature of painting has led to a painterly practice that underscores the mediated experience of reality by incorporating imagery based on found and familiar photographs. Atlas, a vast compilation of such imagery begun in 1962, attests to the importance of the photographic in his oeuvre. Photographs, in his view, provide a pretext for a painting, injecting a measure of objectivity and eliminating the processes of apprehension and interpretation. While not based on a specific photographic source, the mirrorlike forms of Passage, with their muted palette and formal austerity, exemplify a lack of emotive presence in keeping with the artist's efforts to demystify the traditions of high culture.In 1976, Richter's picturesso called by the artist in order to avoid an emphasis on the painterlymade a decisive move toward abstraction in a series of richly polychromed canvases. Given his conviction that pure painting is ridiculous anyway, Richter turned again to photography as a means to mediate the highly subjective bent of abstract painting, creating small sketches that he photographed and translated into large-scale canvases. While continuing in this style, he eventually dispensed with the photographic intermediary. The highly gestured surfaces of works such as Korn can thus be best understood not as expressive paintings in the shadow of Abstract Expressionism, but as part of an ongoing project to contest the venerated tropes of authenticity and subjectivity. \r\n\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThroughout his career, Robert Ryman has attempted to eliminate illusionism and outside references from his work, focusing instead on the fundamental properties of the materials he employs. He has confined himself to the color white, yet disclaims its importance. It was never my intention to make white paintings, he insisted in a 1986 interview with critic Nancy Grimes. And it still isnt. . . . The white is just a means of exposing other elements of the painting. These other elements include varieties of paint (oil and acrylic) and supports (canvas, paper, and metals), as well as the process of binding them. He investigates the properties of these elements methodically, yet responds spontaneously to the unpredictable exigencies caused by their interaction.Rymans Classico 4 is one of a series of compositions consisting of multi-panel paintings on a specific type of paper called Classico. For each work in the series, Ryman attached a configuration of heavy, creamy white sheets of the paper to a wall with masking tape, painted the sheets with a shiny white acrylic paint, removed the tape when the sheets were dry, mounted them on foamcore, and reattached them to the wall. The built-up paint edge tracing the outline of masking tape and the ripped paper left behind give witness to the process of creation. The various works in the Classico series differ in the organization of paper sheets, the configuration of tape traces, and the painted shape, yet they share an emphasis on the thinness of the support surface in its alignment with the wall and the monumentality conceived as an accumulation of parts.Just as the Classico works were titled after the type of paper used as a medium, the so-called Surface Veil works were named for the brand of fiberglass upon which the smaller pieces in this group were painted. Surface Veil I, II, and III are among four 12-foot square paintings from the series that were executed not on fiber-glass but on cotton or linen. In each of these works the pigment appears to form a membrane over the support due to the differing degrees of opacity and translucence in the white paint juxtaposed with areas where less of it has been applied, leaving the fabric exposed. These disruptions in the paintings skin often mark the literal pauses between the artists working sessions.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nGeorge Segal is perhaps best known for his whitewashed sculptural tableaux capturing quotidian American life. Associated with Pop art as well as with artist friends like Allan Kaprowwhose Happenings first took place on Segal's New Jersey farmand composer John Cage, Segal created a distinctive style that resulted from a concerted effort to combine art and life in one space. The artist enlisted his friends, family, and associates as live models for his sculptures, using plaster bandages in place of traditional casting methods. Originally trained as a painter, he was drawn to sculpture's three-dimensional representations of reality, and around 1958 Segal began to make sculpture that came off the pedestal and located in the space of life itself.The six figures in The Costume Party (196572)three men and three women, some standing, others reclining, and one sittingappear in an array of primary colors. Their posture and placement suggest a narrative, though they are unaccompanied by the descriptive settings typical of Segal's works. The subject matter springs from personal experienceSegal had attended \"a Halloween party and decided that the theme had possibilities.\"1 He considered this work to be \"pure fantasy, and a move away from the \"relentlessly banal\" subjects of his previous five years of work.2 This dark fantasy collects figures from literary and popular culture into one momentAntony (cast from dealer Richard Bellamy) and Cleopatra reclining on the floor next to a seated Catwoman and presided over by the fool Bottom from William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, Superman, and the James Bond villain Pussy Galore. Reworked over a period of seven years, The Costume Party has been exhibited in different configurations and color schemes; with each change Segal felt the grouping took on a nightmarish, hallucinatory mood, which for the artist became, through the making of this piece, increasingly connected to color. The Costume Party was Segal's first foray into finished sculpture painted in color, although he had previously painted the titular article of clothing of Woman In Red Jacket (1958) in polychrome. Though he did not return to the colored figure until the mid-1970s, both Segal and critics connect the coloration of these figures to the artist's roots in painting. Expressively painted, the elemental color choices are juxtaposed against his trademark white. They also have a larger spiritual valence: around 1968, a friend lent Segal a book about a Lakota leader, Black Elk Speaks (1932), which describes the four colors of the universe as being black, red, blue, and yellow. The Costume Party's vibrant, intense hues and Segal's attention to what he termed \"pedestrian space\" pull the viewer into a space halfway between sculpture and real life. Carmen Hermo1.

What began as an investigation of the artist's own body in spacehow it interacts with a given environment and how, in turn, that location affects ithas evolved into the construction of space itself. This trajectory is inscribed from the private, photographic recording of the body in a designated site to his more recent creation of sites for public engagement. The relationship of the private to the publicand how the self participates in the surrounding worldhas been a constant theme in Acconci's art. In 1969, already a published poet, Acconci made his first visual artworks, moving from the static domain of the printed page to the dynamic space of the empirical world. Combining photographs with texts, the artist documented task-oriented activitiesjumping, stretching, bending, etc.that he performed specifically for the lens. In Grasp (1969), Acconci acknowledges the archival capabilities of photography\"camera as grasp, photo as storage\"but foregrounds the performative act of picture taking, of physically seizing an image. This project announces the dialogue between camera and body that is essential to Acconci's subsequent work, particularly in the series of videos and Super 8 films made between 1969 and 1974 in which he obsessively contemplates his own body as a (gendered) site. These privately filmed performances (which are also documented in photo/text panels) involve a level of corporeal manipulation that borders on masochismAcconci is shown plucking hairs from around his navel, throwing soapy water into his eyes, and cramming his fist in his mouth. In Conversions II (1971), the second in a trilogy of films interrogating the rigidity of gender binarism, the artist attempts to feminize his unquestionably male body by hiding his genitals between his legs. By casting his own masculinity into question, by performing its absence, Acconci problematizes the dictum that the male (or female) subject is a coherent being. Acconci's  TELE-FURNI-SYSTEM (1997), an installation designed for watching video (his own and those of other artists), invites each visitor to interact with the environment by choosing his or her own viewing positions from a menu of different architectural options. Each monitor serves as a separate video channel and a building block in the network of stairs, benches, and lounges that constitute the piece. Here it is the viewer who activates the space by physically engaging with it and contemplating the panoply of moving images on display. Nancy Spector\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nLarry Bell's art exploits the surface qualities and effects of glass: its capacity to be simultaneously clear and reflective, hard and insubstantial. After incorporating sections of glass into paintings on shaped canvases depicting the volume of a cube, Bell began to create literal, three-dimensional glass cubes in 196263. In his early cubes, Bell compromised visual access to the interior by scratching into the glass surface or using opaque materials such as Formica and mirrored glass to create elliptical patterns, bars, and checkerboards. Gradually, he worked toward a more reduced form, stripping away all surface ornamentation and employing a vacuum-coating process, through which metallic particles are made to adhere to the panes of glass, to subtly manipulate the level of transparency and opacity.With their enclosed rectilinear shapes, the cubes bear a resemblance to Minimalist sculptures that were being made contemporaneously in New York. But like other Light-and-Space artists active in Los Angeles in the 1960s, Bell was interested less in literal, material objects than in the nature of our perception. At the same time that they carve out and define a given volume of space, works like 20\" Untitled 1969 (Tom Messer Cube) (1969) become a continuum of their surrounding space, partly reflecting whatever happens to be in the environment while also permitting the viewer to see through them from every angle. By setting some of his cubes on clear Plexiglas pedestals, Bell further collapses their physical presence and produces a sense of weightlessness. The gray-tinged cube of this work seems more substantial than its invisible base and appears to hover in the air.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWhen Eva Hesse came to maturity as an artist during the mid-1960s, the womens movement and the sexual revolution were emerging as powerful, liberating forces in the U.S. It was a time when voices of the counterculture gained widespread recognition. The urge toward radical reappraisal and reform was manifest in the art world as wellPop art and Minimalism displaced Abstract Expressionism through their categorical dismissal of artistic subjectivity and the heroic gesture. Almost immediately, however, artists questioned the geometric rigidity of Minimalism and the limitations of the Pop idiom. Finding inspiration in the human body, the random occurrence, the process of improvisation, and the liberating qualities of nontraditional materials such as industrial felt, molten lead, wax, and rubber, these artists mined a new aesthetic sensibility variously known as Anti-Form, Post-Minimalism, or Process art.During her brief career Hesse contributed to this radical undermining of artistic convention with her abstract yet sensual sculptural works. She rejected the standard attributes of monumental sculpturevolume, mass, and verticalityin favor of eccentric forms made from rope, latex, and cheesecloth, all of which decompose with time. Her goal, she explained, was to portray the essential absurdity of life. In formal terms, this theme was realized through a wedding of contradictions: order versus chaos, stringy versus mass, huge versus small, in the artists words. Acutely aware of the challenges faced by a female artist in a predominantly male environment, Hesse may have utilized such formal opposites as a metaphor for her own position in the art world and to emphasize the inherent strength of flexibility and vulnerability.Expanded Expansion is a sculptural embodiment of opposites united. Both permanence and deterioration operate in the piece: fiberglass polesrigid, durable entitiesare juxtaposed with fragile, rubber-covered cheesecloth. While its height is determined by the poles, the width of the piece varies with each installation; like an accordion or curtain, it can be compressed or extended. Its repetitive units echo the programmatic seriality of Minimalism, but here they accentuate Hesses desire to illuminate her view that if something is absurd, its much more exaggerated, more absurd if its repeated. The very redundancy of the title reinforces this idea.Nancy Spector \r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nBeginning in the late 1960s, Joan Jonas created a groundbreaking series of works that established her as one of the pioneering forces in body art, performance, and video art. Undertaking a sustained examination of the process, politics, and psychology of spectatorship, Jonas adopted numerous strategies for complicating her audiences relationship to her staged activities. She employed mirrors as props and structuring devices, separated performers and spectators by great physical distances, and eventually incorporated live video feeds that multiplied and fragmented viewers' perspectives of her actions. Mirror Piece I (1969) featured performers carrying oblong mirrors in slowly choreographed movements before the audience, alternately reflecting their own bodies and the surroundings, and offering the audience a flattened view of itself as an image within the performance. The photograph acquired by the Guggenheim Museum is a rare document of that work, shot by the artist herself. In it a single performer sits in the grass holding a mirror that fragments and replicates her body into an uncanny, almost Surrealist form. In both a literal and pictorial sense, Jonas denies the audience any position of stability from which to apprehend what lies before it.Nat Trotman\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the early 1960s Donald Judd abandoned painting, having recognized that actual space is intrinsically more powerful and specific than paint on a flat surface.1 His move into three dimensions was coincident with a growing acknowledgment among other artists of his generation of the physical environment as an integral aspect of an artwork. Minimalist sculpture broke with illusionistic conventions by translating compositional concerns into three dimensions, rendering the work a product of the exchange between the object, the viewer, and the environment.In his 1965 essay Specific Objects, Judd championed recent work that was neither painting nor sculpture by a diverse range of artists such as Lee Bontecou, Mark di Suvero, Claes Oldenburg, and Frank Stella. His endorsement of the thing as a whole rather than a composition of parts stemmed from what he saw as the strength and clarity asserted by singular forms, the unitary character of which resulted from the conflation of color, image, shape, and surface. Judds earliest freestanding sculptures were singular, boxlike forms constructed of wood or metal. The simple shape of Untitled (1968), with its slightly recessed upper surface, is readily intelligible as a whole and thus avoids the compositional effects that for Judd diluted a works power. As the artists exploration of three-dimensional space became more complex, his aversion to such effects was manifested in a number of strategies designed to subordinate a works individual components to the whole.Like the rectangular shape with which he began, Judds rows and progressions are legible systems that reoccur in his oeuvre. In its repetition of serial forms and spaces, the vertical stack of Untitled (1969) literally incorporates space as one of its materials along with highly polished copper, creating a play between positive and negative that coheres as a totality. Similarly, in Untitled (1970), the application of a dual Fibonacci progression (a mathematically based sequence in which each number is the sum of the two previous two: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and so on) imparts an internal logic to both solid and void alike, the anodized color of the boxes throwing the mathematical system into greater relief. While spatial concerns were foremost for Judd, color and materials always remained central to his conception of art. Sustained and rigorous investigations of space and form, his project is tempered by a rich palette of industrial materials, such as stainless steel, aluminum, and translucent Plexiglas, the varied surfaces and finishes of which lend a sumptuous air to an otherwise austere undertaking.J.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the increasingly theoretical New York art world of the 1960s and 1970s, painting was displaced in favor of sculpture in a new mode that privileged concept over material, idea over sensory quality. When painting did appear, the prevailing aesthetic called for pristine, monochromatic surfaces that appeared to have been untouched by the artists hand. Brice Marden departed from these stylistic strictures in search of something more emotionally charged and personal. His early single-color panels reconcile the stringent subtractions of Minimalism with his more expressive impulses as a painter. Upon close inspection, Mardens matte canvases, layered with thick encaustic (his characteristic oil-and-wax technique), reveal the marks of the palette knife, the subtle ridges in the viscous material inflecting each panels uniform color and opacity with impressions of the painters working process. This evidence, along with the artists anachronistic tendency toward the lyrical, is what distinguishes his work from that of his Minimalist contemporaries who rely on a cool industrial quality.Although Mardens paintings are non-objective, he often draws upon specific people, places, or other works of art as sources. Inspired by the austere palette of the Spanish masters Goya and Zurbaran, his early paintings achieve a brooding gravity through subtle, low-key color combinations. Dapres la Marquise de la Solana is a response to Goyas portrait of the Marquise, which Marden saw in the Louvre. His translation of the 18th-century figure into the language of reductivist abstraction is a potent distillation of the color, light, and mood in Goyas original. Delicately worked panels of olive-taupe, gray, and peach succinctly paraphrase the Marquises elusive expression and dainty poise amid a grand romantic landscape.An unparalleled sensitivity to color as an expressive means is a defining characteristic of Mardens art. The five paintings in the Grove Group series, begun in 1973, were inspired by an olive grove on the Greek Island of Hydra, where the artist has spent time. Marden, who sees art as a trampoline into spirituality, refers to these as high-intensity paintings, intending his use of light and color to elicit an emotional response from the viewer. Color associations are usually detectable only through Mardens evocative titles; the two-toned composition of Grove IV is a response to the shimmering shift in color from the dark tops to lighter bottoms of the windblown leaves of olive trees.Bridget Alsdorf\r\n        ",

These neutral forms are often leaned against a wall and occupy a position between painting and sculpture. Although they appear to be industrially manufactured, McCrackens pristine surfaces are created through a time-intensive and handmade technique in which fiberglass is applied to plywood, onto which the artist adds layers of polyester mixed with resin and pigment. The result, as evidenced in Blue Plank (1969), is a glossy, lustrous finish evocative of the surface sheen of surfboards and custom cars, both uniquely Californian aesthetic forms of the 1960s. Speaking about the enigmatic quality of his planks, the artist noted, I felt that if something was beautiful, one could enjoy looking at it and therefore stand to apprehend the form in a full wayintellectually, emotionally, and spiritually.1 His eclectic abiding interestsfrom UFOs to ancient Egypt, from cosmology to architecturehaunt his simplified forms, which oscillate between the playful and the sublime.\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nBruce Nauman defies the traditional notion that an artist should have one signature style and a visually unified oeuvre. Since the mid-1960s the artist has created an open-ended body of work that includes fiberglass sculptures, abstract body casts, performances, films, neon wall reliefs, interactive environments, videos, and motorized carousels displaying cast-aluminum animal carcasses. If anything links such diverse endeavors, it is Naumans insistence that aesthetic experience supersedes the actual object in importance. Perception itselfthe viewers encounter with his or her body and mind in relation to the art objectcan be interpreted as the subject matter of Naumans work. Using puns, claustrophobic passageways with surveillance cameras, and videotaped recitations of bad jokes, he has created situations that are physically or intellectually disorienting, forcing viewers to confront their own experiential thresholds.Nauman adopted neon signage during the 1960s (perhaps in response to Pop art) to illustrate his Duchampian word plays. None Sing Neon Sign (1970) is an anagram that, like Naumans other semiotically playful neon piecesRaw War (1970) and Run from Fear/Fun from Rear (1972), for exampleunderscores the arbitrary relationship between a words definition, what it sounds like, and what it looks like. A circular sign from 1967 of the spiraling neon phrase THE TRUE ARTIST HELPS THE WORLD BY REVEALING MYSTIC TRUTHS suggests, in retrospect and with irony, that these truths may be nothing more than the subtle distinctions between aesthetic illusion, artistic hype, and meaning.Nauman enforces the contrast between the perceptual and physical experience of space in his sculptures and installations. Looking at the brilliant color emanating from Green Light Corridor (1970) prompts quite a different phenomenological experience than does maneuvering through its narrow confines. Lighted Performance Box (1969) provokes another experiential situation. As a rectangular column, it resembles the quintessential unitary Minimalist sculpture, yet the square of light cast on the ceiling from the lamp encased inside alters ones reading of the piece: the sense of a hidden, unattainable space, one that can only be experienced vicariously, is evoked. Thus, the performance alluded to in the title is only a private, conceptual act, initiated when viewers attempt to mentally project their own bodies into this implied interior place.Nancy Spector\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1967 and 1968, Bruce Nauman produced a number of films and videos in which he captured himself performing various repetitive, tasklike exercises within the privacy of his studiofrom bouncing against a corner of the room to slowly and deliberately walking around the perimeter of a delineated square. By the early 1970s, with his corridors and other large-scale rooms and environments, Nauman had withdrawn his own presence, shifting the focus of his work to manipulating the movement and experience of the beholder. Performance Corridor (1969) marks the pivotal moment of this transition. The work originated as a prop for a solitary, videotaped performance, Walk with Contrapposto (1968), in which Nauman is seen walking up and down a narrow passageway, shifting his hips back and forth with each step in an exaggerated imitation of the conventional pose of classical sculpture. The corridor itself was a makeshift structure: two parallel wallboards form a 20-inch-wide passage that is blocked at one end; the narrow space could just contain the movement of the artist's body. For the Whitney Museum in New York's seminal 1969 show, Anti-Illusion: Procedures/Materials, Nauman transferred this prop to a public exhibition space, where it was left to the individual beholder, deprived of instructions, to decide whether or not to enter the structure and how to move through it. Performance Corridor imposed certain physical limits on its audience, but Nauman nevertheless recalled feeling some frustration at not being able to more fully \"control the situation.\"1 In subsequent corridors, he developed a number of devices to accomplish just this, from mirrors and intense, colored fluorescent light (see, for example, Green Light Corridor, made in 1970) to the closed-circuit video technology of contemporary surveillance systems. Related to part of a multi-corridor installation that Nauman constructed earlier in 1970 at the Nicholas Wilder Gallery in Los Angeles, Live-Taped Video Corridor features two stacked television monitors at its far end, both linked to a camera mounted at the corridor's entrance: the top monitor plays live feed from the camera, while the bottom monitor plays pretaped footage of the empty passageway from the identical angle. Walking down the corridor, one views oneself from behind in the top monitor, diminishing in size as one gets closer to it. The camera's wide-angle lens heightens one's disorientation by making the rate of one's movement appear somewhat sped up. Meanwhile, the participant is entirely, and uncannily, absent from the lower monitor. The overall result is an unsettling self-conscious experience of doubling and displacement. Ted Mann1.

But to characterize him simply as an Earthwork artist would be to miss the depth of his vision, which lies in the interstices between sculpture, Land art, photography, film, and the written word. Throughout his tragically short career, Smithson mounted an attack against the strictures of art history, which venerates the static object and divides art from the exigencies of the real world. He searched for an aesthetic form that would be coterminous with the world at large. His nonsites, fragments taken from a landscape and framed within a gallery, broke down the polarity between inside and outside, leaving open the possibility of a third term that would contain both. Time and the phenomenon of entropy were central to his project, and photography was the perfect medium through which to capture the process and effects of duration. The act of photographinglike the activities of mapping, measuring, digging, pouring, mirroring, and writingwas an essential component of Smithsons practice. His photographic essay A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey (1967) describes tangible manifestations of entropic statesindustrial structures that were already deteriorating at the time of their construction.Hotel Palenque perfectly embodies the artists notion of a ruin in reverse. During a trip to Mexico in 1969, he photographed an old, eccentrically constructed hotel, which was undergoing a cycle of simultaneous decay and renovation. Smithson used these images in a lecture presented to architecture students at the University of Utah in 1972, in which he humorously analyzed the centerless, de-architecturalized site. Extant today as a slide installation with a tape recording of the artists voice, Hotel Palenque provides a direct view into Smithsons theoretical approach to the effects of entropy on the cultural landscape.While in Mexico, Smithson also created the Yucatan Mirror Displacements (19) by installing 12-inch-square mirrors on dispersed sites. The resulting series of nine color photographs was published in Artforum to accompany Smithsons essay Incidents of Mirror-Travel in the Yucatan (1969). The mirrors reflected and refracted the surrounding environs, displacing the solidity of the landscape and shattering its forms. Part Earthwork and part image, the displacements contemplate temporality; while the mirror records the passage of time, its photograph suspends time.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nLawrence Weiner is a sculptor whose medium is language. His texts describe material processes and physical conditions; they delineate space and indicate location. Since 1968, when he concluded that the actual construction of a work was not critical to its existence in the world, Weiner has authored hundreds of linguistic artworks. Prior to this time, his material sculptures had been prefaced by titles that dictated the means of their fabrication. When the outdoor installation A SERIES OF STAKES SET IN THE GROUND AT REGULAR INTERVALS TO FORM A RECTANGLETWINE STRUNG FROM STAKE TO STAKE TO DEMARK A GRIDA RECTANGLE REMOVED FROM THIS RECTANGLE (1968) was damaged, Weiner realized that the essence of a work is textual and not physical. This led him to the following formulation, first published in 1968, which continues to outline his conceptual approach to artmaking: (1) The artist may construct the piece. (2) The piece may be fabricated. (3) The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of artist, the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership.1In a radical restructuring of the traditional artist/viewer relationship, Weiner shifted the responsibility of the work's realization to its audience, while also redefining standard systems of artistic distribution. A work such as A STAKE SET (1969) can be made or merely spelled out on a museum wall, but it can also be read in a book or heard if uttered aloud. Weiner's art can literally be disseminated by word of mouth. Much of the early work rehearses simple actions involving basic substancespouring paint, digging trenches, removing plasterand, like all subsequent examples, are stated in the past tense to avoid the authoritative tone of a command. Others are more spectacular, involving firecrackers and dynamite.

    "description": "\nDescription\nLawrence Weiner is a sculptor whose medium is language. His texts describe material processes and physical conditions; they delineate space and indicate location. Since 1968, when he concluded that the actual construction of a work was not critical to its existence in the world, Weiner has authored hundreds of linguistic artworks. Prior to this time, his material sculptures had been prefaced by titles that dictated the means of their fabrication. When the outdoor installation A SERIES OF STAKES SET IN THE GROUND AT REGULAR INTERVALS TO FORM A RECTANGLETWINE STRUNG FROM STAKE TO STAKE TO DEMARK A GRIDA RECTANGLE REMOVED FROM THIS RECTANGLE (1968) was damaged, Weiner realized that the essence of a work is textual and not physical. This led him to the following formulation, first published in 1968, which continues to outline his conceptual approach to artmaking: (1) The artist may construct the piece. (2) The piece may be fabricated. (3) The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of artist, the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership.1In a radical restructuring of the traditional artist/viewer relationship, Weiner shifted the responsibility of the work's realization to its audience, while also redefining standard systems of artistic distribution. A work such as A STAKE SET (1969) can be made or merely spelled out on a museum wall, but it can also be read in a book or heard if uttered aloud. Weiner's art can literally be disseminated by word of mouth. Much of the early work rehearses simple actions involving basic substancespouring paint, digging trenches, removing plasterand, like all subsequent examples, are stated in the past tense to avoid the authoritative tone of a command. Others are more spectacular, involving firecrackers and dynamite.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1967 and 1968, Bruce Nauman produced a number of films and videos in which he captured himself performing various repetitive, tasklike exercises within the privacy of his studiofrom bouncing against a corner of the room to slowly and deliberately walking around the perimeter of a delineated square. By the early 1970s, with his corridors and other large-scale rooms and environments, Nauman had withdrawn his own presence, shifting the focus of his work to manipulating the movement and experience of the beholder. Performance Corridor (1969) marks the pivotal moment of this transition. The work originated as a prop for a solitary, videotaped performance, Walk with Contrapposto (1968), in which Nauman is seen walking up and down a narrow passageway, shifting his hips back and forth with each step in an exaggerated imitation of the conventional pose of classical sculpture. The corridor itself was a makeshift structure: two parallel wallboards form a 20-inch-wide passage that is blocked at one end; the narrow space could just contain the movement of the artist's body. For the Whitney Museum in New York's seminal 1969 show, Anti-Illusion: Procedures/Materials, Nauman transferred this prop to a public exhibition space, where it was left to the individual beholder, deprived of instructions, to decide whether or not to enter the structure and how to move through it. Performance Corridor imposed certain physical limits on its audience, but Nauman nevertheless recalled feeling some frustration at not being able to more fully \"control the situation.\"1 In subsequent corridors, he developed a number of devices to accomplish just this, from mirrors and intense, colored fluorescent light (see, for example, Green Light Corridor, made in 1970) to the closed-circuit video technology of contemporary surveillance systems. Related to part of a multi-corridor installation that Nauman constructed earlier in 1970 at the Nicholas Wilder Gallery in Los Angeles, Live-Taped Video Corridor features two stacked television monitors at its far end, both linked to a camera mounted at the corridor's entrance: the top monitor plays live feed from the camera, while the bottom monitor plays pretaped footage of the empty passageway from the identical angle. Walking down the corridor, one views oneself from behind in the top monitor, diminishing in size as one gets closer to it. The camera's wide-angle lens heightens one's disorientation by making the rate of one's movement appear somewhat sped up. Meanwhile, the participant is entirely, and uncannily, absent from the lower monitor. The overall result is an unsettling self-conscious experience of doubling and displacement. Ted Mann1.

Yet it was in frustration with what she perceived as the inadequacy of such mass-media imagestheir seeming remoteness from the concerns of daily life in the U.S.that Martha Rosler produced her Bringing the War Home: House Beautiful series (196772). Since the 1960s, Rosler has employed a range of mediums, from photography and video to performance and writing, to criticize gender stereotypes and grapple with an array of social issues. For Bringing the War Home, she turned to photomontage, a technique with a long history of political usage. By splicing together war photographs from Life magazine and tranquil, domestic interiors from the pages of House Beautiful, Rosler made events in Southeast Asia appear to literally enter the American home. In the Guggenheim's Red Stripe Kitchen, two soldiers survey the terrain in back of a sleekly modern kitchen. Through such visual overlaying, Rosler disturbs the comforting illusion of distance between \"here\" and \"there\" and suggests a relationship between U.S. foreign policy and the consumer culture back home. Over 30 years later, these images have lost none of their original forceor relevance.Ted Mann\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWith paintings such as Untitled (Violet, Black, Orange, Yellow on White and Red), Mark Rothko arrived at his mature idiom. For the next 20 years he would explore the expressive potential of stacked rectangular fields of luminous colors. Like other New York School artists, Rothko used abstract means to express universal human emotions, earnestly striving to create an art of awe-inspiring intensity for a secular world.In order to explain the power of his canvases, some art historians have cited their compositional similarity to Romantic landscape painting and Christian altar decoration. Anna Chave suggests that Rothkos early interest in religious iconography underlies his later work. She sees a reference to a Madonna and Child in Untitled (#17), an apparently abstract work that developed out of the Surrealistic biological fantasies that he had been painting in the early 1940s. For Chave, mature paintings such as Untitled (Violet, Black, Orange, Yellow on White and Red) metaphorically encompass the cycle of life from cradle to grave, in part by harboring an oblique reference to both adorations and entombments. The stacked rectangles may be read vertically as an abstracted Virgin bisected by horizontal divisions that indicate the supine Christ. Even without Chaves argument, it is clear that Rothko hoped to harness the grandeur of religious painting. The principles of frontality and iconic imagery in his mature works are common to traditional altarpieces, and both formats have similar dimensions and proportions. Often larger than a human being, Rothkos canvases inspire the kind of wonder and reverence traditionally associated with monumental religious or landscape painting.It was Rothkos euphoric veils of diaphanous pure color that led critics to praise him as a sensualist and a colorist, which pained him because he believed that his champions had lost sight of his serious intentions. For him the canvases enacted a violent battle of oppositesvertical versus horizontal, hot color versus coldinvoking the existential conflicts of modernity. The Black Paintings, begun in the year before the artists suicide, confirm Rothkos belief that his work encompassed tragedy. The desolation of canvases such as Untitled (Black on Gray), drained of color and choked by a white borderrather than suggesting the free-floating forms or veiled layers of his earlier workindicate that, as Rothko asserted, his paintings are about death.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

Like the artists who would come to be associated with that movement, Serra employed nontraditional materials in his sculpture, in this case belts suspended from hooks on the wall. The pieces anthropomorphic qualitythe belts suggest limp figures or twisted harnessesindicates that Serra was also familiar with contemporaneous sculptural reflections on the human body made by Eva Hesse and Bruce Nauman. Serras style would change radically in the ensuing years, but his sensitivity to the body, its capacity for action, and its crucial role in perception has remained a constant in the work.Serra envisions sculpture as the physical manifestation of transitive verbs. In 1967 and 1968 he compiled a list of infinitives that served as catalysts for subsequent work: to hurl suggested the hurling of molten lead into crevices between wall and floor; to roll led to the rolling of the material into dense, metal logs. While the process of fabricating these pieces was, in essence, their very subject, Serra eventually deemed them too picturesque and he shifted strategies once again. Continuing his employment of lead, Serra utilized another transitive verb: to prop. Right Angle Prop is one of numerous lead constructions, the assemblage of which is dependent on leaning elements. Dispensing with carving and weldingconventional methods of delineating volume and securing massSerra created precarious sculptures that stand by virtue of equilibrium and gravity. Such pieces exist in a constant state of tension, ever revealing the process of their making, ever threatening to tilt off balance. Following the perilous choreography of propping, Serra engaged the verb to cut in a series of large-scale steel sculptures, variations of which he is still producing. Strike is essentially one tall, thin steel slice that, wedged into a corner, bisects the room and demands viewing from both sides. As one walks around the front of the piece, perception continually shifts: plane gives way to edge to plane again. This cut-steel sculpture is itself an implement for cutting space and, in this way, serves as an analogue for the sculptor himself, who stimulates vision by giving material form to the transitive verb.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nRobert Smithson may be best known for his Spiral Jetty (1970), a monumental spiral of crushed rock gracing the waters of Utahs Salt Lake. But to characterize him simply as an Earthwork artist would be to miss the depth of his vision, which lies in the interstices between sculpture, Land art, photography, film, and the written word. Throughout his tragically short career, Smithson mounted an attack against the strictures of art history, which venerates the static object and divides art from the exigencies of the real world. He searched for an aesthetic form that would be coterminous with the world at large. His nonsites, fragments taken from a landscape and framed within a gallery, broke down the polarity between inside and outside, leaving open the possibility of a third term that would contain both. Time and the phenomenon of entropy were central to his project, and photography was the perfect medium through which to capture the process and effects of duration. The act of photographinglike the activities of mapping, measuring, digging, pouring, mirroring, and writingwas an essential component of Smithsons practice. His photographic essay A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey (1967) describes tangible manifestations of entropic statesindustrial structures that were already deteriorating at the time of their construction.Hotel Palenque perfectly embodies the artists notion of a ruin in reverse. During a trip to Mexico in 1969, he photographed an old, eccentrically constructed hotel, which was undergoing a cycle of simultaneous decay and renovation. Smithson used these images in a lecture presented to architecture students at the University of Utah in 1972, in which he humorously analyzed the centerless, de-architecturalized site. Extant today as a slide installation with a tape recording of the artists voice, Hotel Palenque provides a direct view into Smithsons theoretical approach to the effects of entropy on the cultural landscape.While in Mexico, Smithson also created the Yucatan Mirror Displacements (19) by installing 12-inch-square mirrors on dispersed sites. The resulting series of nine color photographs was published in Artforum to accompany Smithsons essay Incidents of Mirror-Travel in the Yucatan (1969). The mirrors reflected and refracted the surrounding environs, displacing the solidity of the landscape and shattering its forms. Part Earthwork and part image, the displacements contemplate temporality; while the mirror records the passage of time, its photograph suspends time.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

The arrangement of elements in this mysterious grouping suggests a natural site, like a forest clearing in which the stag (represented by an ironing board resting on wooden \"legs\"), the excremental forms of the \"primordial animals\" (actually made by plunging tools into piles of clay), and a goat (the hapless three-wheeled cart) are illuminated by a powerful lightning bolt (the weighty triangular form that hangs precariously from a beam). The artist is the human witness to this mythic, symbolic narrative (dominated, as always in Beuys's work, by animals), appearing obliquely in the form of the cast block of earth atop an old sculptor's modeling base.

    "description": "\nDescription\nOver the past forty years, Sigmar Polke has created complex works that have helped define the art of the time. In the 1960s, he forged a new, unique vision of German art, which during the postwar years had been largely derivative of gestural abstraction. During this time Polke began making his dot paintings, manually executed parodies of the Benday dot screens used by Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol. Although he shared visual strategies with American Pop artists, he was less concerned with appropriating the pictorial style of advertising than in depicting the desired objects of a consumer society. While at the Kunstakademie Dusseldorf in 1963, Polke and fellow students Konrad Lueg and Gerhard Richter consolidated their ideas of cultural criticism into a style they termed Capitalist Realism. The humorous and deliberately unskilled qualities of Polke's earliest works formalized a critique of both Socialist Realism and Pop art.During the 1970s, Polke slowed his art production in favor of travel to Afghanistan, Brazil, France, Pakistan, and the U.S., where he shot photographs and film footage that he would incorporate in his subsequent works during the 1980s. Using materials such as sheer synthetic fabrics, colored lacquers, and hydrosensitive chemicals in combination with paint, he began to self-consciously undermine the conventions of painting and to challenge its appropriateness as a medium to comment on contemporary life. Kathreiners Morgenlatte, with its layered composition incorporating fabric and painted imagery, is an example of this questioning. An image of a dull, domestic interior is superimposed over patterned swatches and clippings culled from the mass media, creating a formal metaphor for the complex layering of ideas found in postmodernism. To underscore his destruction of the traditional easel painting, Polke has apparently taken the wooden stretcher, cut it up and strewn the pieces over the surface of the work. Inverting his own name but signing Henri Matisse right side up, Polke ironically comments on the presumed necessity of including an accepted sign of high modernism in order to guarantee the authenticity and value of an artwork. By reconciling a complex group of references in Kathreiners Morgenlatte, Polke presents a critique of the condition of the artist and the impossibility of a sustained originality in contemporary art in the late 20th century.\n",

This collage is one of two nearly identical works entering the collection that employ the same 19th-century photograph, which the artist mounted on board and most likely manipulated to add to its aged appearance.

    "description": "\nDescription\nGeorge Segal is perhaps best known for his whitewashed sculptural tableaux capturing quotidian American life. Associated with Pop art as well as with artist friends like Allan Kaprowwhose Happenings first took place on Segal's New Jersey farmand composer John Cage, Segal created a distinctive style that resulted from a concerted effort to combine art and life in one space. The artist enlisted his friends, family, and associates as live models for his sculptures, using plaster bandages in place of traditional casting methods. Originally trained as a painter, he was drawn to sculpture's three-dimensional representations of reality, and around 1958 Segal began to make sculpture that came off the pedestal and located in the space of life itself.The six figures in The Costume Party (196572)three men and three women, some standing, others reclining, and one sittingappear in an array of primary colors. Their posture and placement suggest a narrative, though they are unaccompanied by the descriptive settings typical of Segal's works. The subject matter springs from personal experienceSegal had attended \"a Halloween party and decided that the theme had possibilities.\"1 He considered this work to be \"pure fantasy, and a move away from the \"relentlessly banal\" subjects of his previous five years of work.2 This dark fantasy collects figures from literary and popular culture into one momentAntony (cast from dealer Richard Bellamy) and Cleopatra reclining on the floor next to a seated Catwoman and presided over by the fool Bottom from William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, Superman, and the James Bond villain Pussy Galore. Reworked over a period of seven years, The Costume Party has been exhibited in different configurations and color schemes; with each change Segal felt the grouping took on a nightmarish, hallucinatory mood, which for the artist became, through the making of this piece, increasingly connected to color. The Costume Party was Segal's first foray into finished sculpture painted in color, although he had previously painted the titular article of clothing of Woman In Red Jacket (1958) in polychrome. Though he did not return to the colored figure until the mid-1970s, both Segal and critics connect the coloration of these figures to the artist's roots in painting. Expressively painted, the elemental color choices are juxtaposed against his trademark white. They also have a larger spiritual valence: around 1968, a friend lent Segal a book about a Lakota leader, Black Elk Speaks (1932), which describes the four colors of the universe as being black, red, blue, and yellow. The Costume Party's vibrant, intense hues and Segal's attention to what he termed \"pedestrian space\" pull the viewer into a space halfway between sculpture and real life. Carmen Hermo1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1967 and 1968, Bruce Nauman produced a number of films and videos in which he captured himself performing various repetitive, tasklike exercises within the privacy of his studiofrom bouncing against a corner of the room to slowly and deliberately walking around the perimeter of a delineated square. By the early 1970s, with his corridors and other large-scale rooms and environments, Nauman had withdrawn his own presence, shifting the focus of his work to manipulating the movement and experience of the beholder. Performance Corridor (1969) marks the pivotal moment of this transition. The work originated as a prop for a solitary, videotaped performance, Walk with Contrapposto (1968), in which Nauman is seen walking up and down a narrow passageway, shifting his hips back and forth with each step in an exaggerated imitation of the conventional pose of classical sculpture. The corridor itself was a makeshift structure: two parallel wallboards form a 20-inch-wide passage that is blocked at one end; the narrow space could just contain the movement of the artist's body. For the Whitney Museum in New York's seminal 1969 show, Anti-Illusion: Procedures/Materials, Nauman transferred this prop to a public exhibition space, where it was left to the individual beholder, deprived of instructions, to decide whether or not to enter the structure and how to move through it. Performance Corridor imposed certain physical limits on its audience, but Nauman nevertheless recalled feeling some frustration at not being able to more fully \"control the situation.\"1 In subsequent corridors, he developed a number of devices to accomplish just this, from mirrors and intense, colored fluorescent light (see, for example, Green Light Corridor, made in 1970) to the closed-circuit video technology of contemporary surveillance systems. Related to part of a multi-corridor installation that Nauman constructed earlier in 1970 at the Nicholas Wilder Gallery in Los Angeles, Live-Taped Video Corridor features two stacked television monitors at its far end, both linked to a camera mounted at the corridor's entrance: the top monitor plays live feed from the camera, while the bottom monitor plays pretaped footage of the empty passageway from the identical angle. Walking down the corridor, one views oneself from behind in the top monitor, diminishing in size as one gets closer to it. The camera's wide-angle lens heightens one's disorientation by making the rate of one's movement appear somewhat sped up. Meanwhile, the participant is entirely, and uncannily, absent from the lower monitor. The overall result is an unsettling self-conscious experience of doubling and displacement. Ted Mann1.

Yet it was in frustration with what she perceived as the inadequacy of such mass-media imagestheir seeming remoteness from the concerns of daily life in the U.S.that Martha Rosler produced her Bringing the War Home: House Beautiful series (196772). Since the 1960s, Rosler has employed a range of mediums, from photography and video to performance and writing, to criticize gender stereotypes and grapple with an array of social issues. For Bringing the War Home, she turned to photomontage, a technique with a long history of political usage. By splicing together war photographs from Life magazine and tranquil, domestic interiors from the pages of House Beautiful, Rosler made events in Southeast Asia appear to literally enter the American home. In the Guggenheim's Red Stripe Kitchen, two soldiers survey the terrain in back of a sleekly modern kitchen. Through such visual overlaying, Rosler disturbs the comforting illusion of distance between \"here\" and \"there\" and suggests a relationship between U.S. foreign policy and the consumer culture back home. Over 30 years later, these images have lost none of their original forceor relevance.Ted Mann\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWith paintings such as Untitled (Violet, Black, Orange, Yellow on White and Red), Mark Rothko arrived at his mature idiom. For the next 20 years he would explore the expressive potential of stacked rectangular fields of luminous colors. Like other New York School artists, Rothko used abstract means to express universal human emotions, earnestly striving to create an art of awe-inspiring intensity for a secular world.In order to explain the power of his canvases, some art historians have cited their compositional similarity to Romantic landscape painting and Christian altar decoration. Anna Chave suggests that Rothkos early interest in religious iconography underlies his later work. She sees a reference to a Madonna and Child in Untitled (#17), an apparently abstract work that developed out of the Surrealistic biological fantasies that he had been painting in the early 1940s. For Chave, mature paintings such as Untitled (Violet, Black, Orange, Yellow on White and Red) metaphorically encompass the cycle of life from cradle to grave, in part by harboring an oblique reference to both adorations and entombments. The stacked rectangles may be read vertically as an abstracted Virgin bisected by horizontal divisions that indicate the supine Christ. Even without Chaves argument, it is clear that Rothko hoped to harness the grandeur of religious painting. The principles of frontality and iconic imagery in his mature works are common to traditional altarpieces, and both formats have similar dimensions and proportions. Often larger than a human being, Rothkos canvases inspire the kind of wonder and reverence traditionally associated with monumental religious or landscape painting.It was Rothkos euphoric veils of diaphanous pure color that led critics to praise him as a sensualist and a colorist, which pained him because he believed that his champions had lost sight of his serious intentions. For him the canvases enacted a violent battle of oppositesvertical versus horizontal, hot color versus coldinvoking the existential conflicts of modernity. The Black Paintings, begun in the year before the artists suicide, confirm Rothkos belief that his work encompassed tragedy. The desolation of canvases such as Untitled (Black on Gray), drained of color and choked by a white borderrather than suggesting the free-floating forms or veiled layers of his earlier workindicate that, as Rothko asserted, his paintings are about death.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the early 1960s Donald Judd abandoned painting, having recognized that actual space is intrinsically more powerful and specific than paint on a flat surface.1 His move into three dimensions was coincident with a growing acknowledgment among other artists of his generation of the physical environment as an integral aspect of an artwork. Minimalist sculpture broke with illusionistic conventions by translating compositional concerns into three dimensions, rendering the work a product of the exchange between the object, the viewer, and the environment.In his 1965 essay Specific Objects, Judd championed recent work that was neither painting nor sculpture by a diverse range of artists such as Lee Bontecou, Mark di Suvero, Claes Oldenburg, and Frank Stella. His endorsement of the thing as a whole rather than a composition of parts stemmed from what he saw as the strength and clarity asserted by singular forms, the unitary character of which resulted from the conflation of color, image, shape, and surface. Judds earliest freestanding sculptures were singular, boxlike forms constructed of wood or metal. The simple shape of Untitled (1968), with its slightly recessed upper surface, is readily intelligible as a whole and thus avoids the compositional effects that for Judd diluted a works power. As the artists exploration of three-dimensional space became more complex, his aversion to such effects was manifested in a number of strategies designed to subordinate a works individual components to the whole.Like the rectangular shape with which he began, Judds rows and progressions are legible systems that reoccur in his oeuvre. In its repetition of serial forms and spaces, the vertical stack of Untitled (1969) literally incorporates space as one of its materials along with highly polished copper, creating a play between positive and negative that coheres as a totality. Similarly, in Untitled (1970), the application of a dual Fibonacci progression (a mathematically based sequence in which each number is the sum of the two previous two: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and so on) imparts an internal logic to both solid and void alike, the anodized color of the boxes throwing the mathematical system into greater relief. While spatial concerns were foremost for Judd, color and materials always remained central to his conception of art. Sustained and rigorous investigations of space and form, his project is tempered by a rich palette of industrial materials, such as stainless steel, aluminum, and translucent Plexiglas, the varied surfaces and finishes of which lend a sumptuous air to an otherwise austere undertaking.J.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1964, at New Yorks Green Gallery, Robert Morris exhibited a suite of large-scale polyhedron forms constructed from 2 x 4s and gray-painted plywood. This kind of simple geometric sculpture came to be called Minimalist because it seemed to be stripped of extraneous distractions such as figural or metaphorical reference, detail or ornament, and even surface inflection. Sculptures like the Untitled (Corner Piece), one component of the 1964 suite, boldly delineate the space in which they are located, thus defining the physical and temporal relationship of the viewer to the sculptural object.Morriss sculptures often consist of industrial or building materials such as steel, fiberglass, and plywood, and were commercially fabricated according to the artists specifications. The value of the artists handthe unique gesture that defines an individuals skill and stylewas inimical to Morris, and the work of art became, in theory, not an original object but a representation of the idea from which it was conceived. This notion allowed for the creation and destruction of a piece when necessary; Untitled (Corner Piece), for example, can be refabricated each time it is to be exhibited.In 1968 Morris introduced an entirely different aesthetic approach, which he articulated in an essay entitled Anti-Form. In this and later writings he reassessed his assumptions underlying Minimalist art and concluded that, contrary to earlier assertions, the construction of such objects had relied on subjective decisions and therefore resulted in iconsmaking them essentially no different than traditional sculpture. The art that he, Eva Hesse, Richard Serra, and others began to explore at the end of the 1960s stressed the unusual materials they employedindustrial components such as wire, rubber, and feltand their response to simple actions such as cutting and dropping. Untitled (Pink Felt) (1970), for example, is composed of dozens of sliced pink industrial felt pieces that have been dropped unceremoniously on the floor. Morriss scattered felt strips obliquely allude to the human body through their response to gravity and epidermal quality. The ragged irregular contours of the jumbled heap refuse to conform to the strict unitary profile that is characteristic of Minimalist sculpture. This, along with its growing referentiality, led Morriss work of the late-1960s and early 1970s to be referred to by such terms as Anti-Form, Process art, or Post-Minimalism.Jennifer Blessing\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1966, while a selection of his spray-gun paintings were on view at the Venice Biennale, Jules Olitski made explicit his unique attitude toward color, writing in a prepared statement: \"Color must be felt throughout.\"1 A sculptor and Color Field painter who, along with colleagues Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, and Kenneth Noland, was featured in Clement Greenberg's landmark 1964 exhibition Post Painterly Abstraction, Olitski devoted a career to experimenting with color, surface, and paint application, producing all-over fields of color via drastically different methods: thick, gestural painting, paint staining, and, most significantly, spraying.\nOlitski's \"matter\" paintings of the 1950s exhibit signs of several major stylistic influences, including the tactile, impasto surfaces of Jean Dubuffet's paintings of the 1940s (which Olitski saw in Paris between 1949 and 1951) and the \"flowing paint\" and chiaroscuro of Rembrandt. Olitski's fascination with the Dutch painter, who he called his greatest \"master,\" began in his teenage years and was intensified during his academic training at New York's National Gallery of Design (now the National Museum and School of Fine Arts) in the early 1940s. As late as 1977 he continued to reference the Baroque master.\nOlitski began working with newly available, thin acrylic paint to stain unprimed, unsized canvas in 1961 (he had begun staining with other mediums a year prior), several years after similar experiments by Frankenthaler, Louis, and Noland. Olitski's early works of this period depict airy, clearly demarcated ovoid forms alongside areas of raw canvas. But in 1964, he attempted to focus more on pure color by restricting all linear elements and edges to the borders of the picture surface, either leaving the edge of the canvas untouched or inserting a thin wash of paint. In doing so, Olitski could point to the limits of the surface as a form of cropping or more insightfully as drawing.\nThat same year Olitski came upon the technique that would define much of his subsequent career. While visiting Noland's studio with friend and sculptor Anthony Caro and a group of students from Bennington College, Vermont (Olitski taught there from 1963 to 1967), Olitski casually stated, in response to a comment from Caro: \"What I would like in my painting is simply a spray of color that hangs like a cloud, but does not lose its shape.\" According to Olitski, as he recalled the incident over 30 years later, the next day he purchased his first spray gun and began experimenting with the new medium. Soon he was using two guns simultaneously to create all-over fields of atmospheric color.\nLysander-1 (1970) distills many of the central themes of Olitski's most mature spray-gun paintings: the tactile, grainy surface caused by the spray technique; the gradual, seamless transition between colors and areas of light and dark; and the elimination of linear drawing from the interior of the picture plane. The work's palette reflects his use of nonprimary, synthetic colors, which, because of varying densities of spray, appear rough and grainy. Using the spray technique to create a cloudlike field in which colors overlap and flow through each other, Olitski effectively banishes drawing to the limits of the canvas, where on the left and upper edges, he has left linear elements that create a tension between the immersive space of the color field and the flatness of the picture surface.\n1.

Like his contemporaries Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, and Andy Warhol, Rosenquist went against the tide of Abstract Expressionism and was labeled a New Realist. He developed his own brand of New Realismlater to be coined Pop artby fragmenting and recombining images drawn from advertising, using commercial paint, and continuing to work on a large scale. Rosenquist was already one of the leaders of the American Pop art movement when he achieved international acclaim in 1965 with his monumental painting F-111 (196465). Measuring 86 feet in length, this work commented on the military industrial complex that supported Americas burgeoning consumer culture and was considered by many to be an anti-war statement.In 1970, Rosenquist painted Flamingo Capsule, which commemorates the American space program and is dedicated to the three astronauts who died in a 1967 flash-fire during a training session for the flight of Apollo I. The composition suggests fire in a contained space, and documents the artists idea of objects floating around in the capsule. Set against a field of red and yellow are the crumpled foil of a uniform emblazoned with the American flag, a twisted and distorted food bag, and the arc of a balloon floating through space.\n",

For each work in the series, Ryman attached a configuration of heavy, creamy white sheets of the paper to a wall with masking tape, painted the sheets with a shiny white acrylic paint, removed the tape when the sheets were dry, mounted them on foamcore, and reattached them to the wall. The built-up paint edge tracing the outline of masking tape and the ripped paper left behind give witness to the process of creation. The various works in the Classico series differ in the organization of paper sheets, the configuration of tape traces, and the painted shape, yet they share an emphasis on the thinness of the support surface in its alignment with the wall and the monumentality conceived as an accumulation of parts.Just as the Classico works were titled after the type of paper used as a medium, the so-called Surface Veil works were named for the brand of fiberglass upon which the smaller pieces in this group were painted. Surface Veil I, II, and III are among four 12-foot square paintings from the series that were executed not on fiber-glass but on cotton or linen.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the constructions of Fred Sandback, conventional distinctions among drawing, sculpting, and building begin to break down. Utilizing the most subtle, unobtrusive means possible, Sandback fused several techniques within the one operation that has defined his work after 1966the use of yarn, cord, or metal rods to shape existing gallery space into forms that, while appearing solid and imposing, are in actuality hollow and immaterial. According to Sandback, the threshold between presence and absence was central to his adoption of yarn and similar materials: \"I think my first attraction to this situation was to the way it allowed me to play with something both existing and not existing at the same time.\"1\nSubtly connected to walls, floors, and ceilings so that their method of attachment is barely visible, Sandback's string works, carefully executed in a variety of colors, suggest geometric forms that extend from or push against existing architecture, inserting themselves into the literal space of the viewer. While his early line works delineate bounded forms, Sandback's later installations appear limitless, enveloping the viewer and making explicit his notion of \"pedestrian space\"a term Sandback coined in 1968 along with fellow sculptor Dan Edge.\nAlthough he is commonly associated with American Minimalist sculptors of the 1960s and 1970s, Sandback was slightly younger than his Minimalist colleagues, allowing him to build on and respond to the concerns of such artists as Donald Judd and Robert Morristwo of Sandback's teachers at Yale College and then Yale University School of Art and Architecture in the mid- to late-1960s. While he studied in New Haven, he also became familiar with the work of Bauhaus master and former Yale professor Josef Albers as well as with the constructions of Naum Gabo, who resided in Middlebury, Connecticut. According to Sandback, Gabo's work influenced him considerably. This influence is reflected in Sandback's fondness for geometric abstraction and unorthodox materials (in particular, Gabo's use of wire and nylon monofilament to outline space most likely left an impression).\nSandback's Pink Corner Piece (1970) is a deceptively simple investigation of the intersection between the sculptural object and its architectural framework. Constructed from two equal lengths of pink elastic cordone stretched horizontally in order to straddle the corner, the other drawn across the floor directly into the point where the two walls meet the groundSandback's work intimates a multiplicity of forms, including a series of triangles or a pair of intersecting rectangles. Unlike industrially fabricated Minimalist objects such as Morris's now iconic Untitled (Corner Piece) (1964)a triangular plywood form inserted into a gallery corner to transform and destabilize the pre-existing architecture of the spaceSandback's piece cooperates with the shape and converging lines of its corner. In the work the distinction between Sandback's cord and the structural line created by the meeting of architectural surfaces is barely discernible. The solidity of architecture is absorbed into the invisible sculpture, merging the two disciplines in a construction that is at once sculpture, architecture, and drawing.\n1.

Like the artists who would come to be associated with that movement, Serra employed nontraditional materials in his sculpture, in this case belts suspended from hooks on the wall. The pieces anthropomorphic qualitythe belts suggest limp figures or twisted harnessesindicates that Serra was also familiar with contemporaneous sculptural reflections on the human body made by Eva Hesse and Bruce Nauman. Serras style would change radically in the ensuing years, but his sensitivity to the body, its capacity for action, and its crucial role in perception has remained a constant in the work.Serra envisions sculpture as the physical manifestation of transitive verbs. In 1967 and 1968 he compiled a list of infinitives that served as catalysts for subsequent work: to hurl suggested the hurling of molten lead into crevices between wall and floor; to roll led to the rolling of the material into dense, metal logs. While the process of fabricating these pieces was, in essence, their very subject, Serra eventually deemed them too picturesque and he shifted strategies once again. Continuing his employment of lead, Serra utilized another transitive verb: to prop. Right Angle Prop is one of numerous lead constructions, the assemblage of which is dependent on leaning elements. Dispensing with carving and weldingconventional methods of delineating volume and securing massSerra created precarious sculptures that stand by virtue of equilibrium and gravity. Such pieces exist in a constant state of tension, ever revealing the process of their making, ever threatening to tilt off balance. Following the perilous choreography of propping, Serra engaged the verb to cut in a series of large-scale steel sculptures, variations of which he is still producing. Strike is essentially one tall, thin steel slice that, wedged into a corner, bisects the room and demands viewing from both sides. As one walks around the front of the piece, perception continually shifts: plane gives way to edge to plane again. This cut-steel sculpture is itself an implement for cutting space and, in this way, serves as an analogue for the sculptor himself, who stimulates vision by giving material form to the transitive verb.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1928, after abandoning his studies in medicine, Victor Vasarely studied art at Muhely, widely referred to as the Hungarian Bauhaus. The school's founder, Sandor Bortnyik, a former student at the Bauhaus in Germany, focused the curriculum on graphic design influenced by Constructivism and Concrete art. Under Bortnyik's tutelage, Vasarely turned from making nearly photorealistic depictions of objects to exploring the formal possibilities inherent in geometric forms and the representation of depth in two dimensions.\nVasarely was also influenced by his teacher's mantra that commercial artists were more honorable and socially relevant than the individual artist seeking self-expression. When the young artist moved to Paris in 1930, he earned a successful living in advertising and design. During World War II he produced a set of drawings in an effort to systematize his advertising graphics with the goal of establishing a school similar to Bortnyik's. Vasarely never realised this plan, but in 1944 he displayed these graphic studies in the inaugural exhibition at the Galerie Denise Renefounded by Rene with Vasarely's input and encouragementand marked his transition from commercial to fine artist.\nIn the early 1950s Vasarely made several series of abstract paintings filled with large geometric and curvilinear forms loosely based on tiles, natural forms, and landscape elements. But by the middle of that decade he had rejected natural prototypes in favor of pure abstractions that drew on geometry, color contrasts, mathematical systems, and Gestalt psychology. In the mid-1950s he resumed the \"movement studies\" of his youth, which stressed form-to-ground relationships and infused his art with the optical impression of depth and dynamism. Vasarely exhibited some of his photographismes (photograph-isms), objects made of layered acrylic glass panes with black geometric patterns that seemed to vibrate and change as the viewer shifted his or her vantage point, in the historic 1955 exhibition Le mouvement (The Movement) at Galerie Denise Rene. On that occasion he also published his Manifeste jaune (Yellow Manifesto), in which he proposed the creation of what he called \"kinetic art.\" Vasarely did not intend the term to be interpreted literally (his work did not actually move); rather, he sought to solve the problem of movement within plastic art through the use of optical illusions that generated a virtual sensation of a moving image. (For this reason, he came to be known as the leading representative of Op art.)\nBy the early 1960s Vasarely had developed a lexicon of shapes and colorswhich he called \"Folklore Planetaire\" (Planetary Folklore)that could be used over and over again in various combinations. He drew on this visual language in his series Homage to the Hexagon (Hommage a la hexagone, 196571), though here he also revisited the three-dimensional trompe l'oeil effects of his earliest works. In a 1972 letter to then-Guggenheim director Thomas M. Messer, Vasarely asserted that Cheyt-M (1970), was \"a fundamental canvas\" of this series and described it as consisting of \"a cellular structure which sustains six equilateral triangles, which gives us three identical lozenges, and finally a hexagon forming a cube called 'Kepler'.\"1  These various geometries emerge from a series of axonometric cubes that fill the picture plane and have distorted curved lines and diagonals that generate visual instability and the illusion of depth and volume. In varying the size of the cubes that fill the surface and in contrasting various colors, Vasarely created a swelling at the center that assumes the form of a sphere; however, it is not clear if that form is emerging from the picture plane, is contained within it, or is pushed back beyond the surface. Such optical games, which physically affect the viewer, even in some cases causing the sensation of vertigo, form the core of Vasarely's oeuvre.\n1. Victor Vasarely, letter to Thomas M.

    "description": "\nDescription\nLawrence Weiner is a sculptor whose medium is language. His texts describe material processes and physical conditions; they delineate space and indicate location. Since 1968, when he concluded that the actual construction of a work was not critical to its existence in the world, Weiner has authored hundreds of linguistic artworks. Prior to this time, his material sculptures had been prefaced by titles that dictated the means of their fabrication. When the outdoor installation A SERIES OF STAKES SET IN THE GROUND AT REGULAR INTERVALS TO FORM A RECTANGLETWINE STRUNG FROM STAKE TO STAKE TO DEMARK A GRIDA RECTANGLE REMOVED FROM THIS RECTANGLE (1968) was damaged, Weiner realized that the essence of a work is textual and not physical. This led him to the following formulation, first published in 1968, which continues to outline his conceptual approach to artmaking: (1) The artist may construct the piece. (2) The piece may be fabricated. (3) The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of artist, the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership.1In a radical restructuring of the traditional artist/viewer relationship, Weiner shifted the responsibility of the work's realization to its audience, while also redefining standard systems of artistic distribution. A work such as A STAKE SET (1969) can be made or merely spelled out on a museum wall, but it can also be read in a book or heard if uttered aloud. Weiner's art can literally be disseminated by word of mouth. Much of the early work rehearses simple actions involving basic substancespouring paint, digging trenches, removing plasterand, like all subsequent examples, are stated in the past tense to avoid the authoritative tone of a command. Others are more spectacular, involving firecrackers and dynamite. THE RESIDUE OF A FLARE IGNITED UPON A BOUNDARY (1969), a piece that Weiner actually executed in Amsterdam for the Stedelijk Museum's pivotal 1969 Conceptual art exhibition Op Losse Schroeven: Situaties en Cryptostructuren (Square Pegs in Round Holes: Structures and Cryptostructures), is poetic in its ability to evoke vivid imagery, while at the time suggesting coded systems of communication. Weiner gradually extended his engagement with language to ready-made structures, such as idioms, cliches, and proverbs, which underscore the contingent nature of meaning when encountered in different contexts. The Christian burial recitation \"Earth to Earth, Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust\" becomes, in nonliturgical circumstances, a simple meditation on materials and processes of transmutation (EARTH TO EARTH ASHES TO ASHES DUST TO DUST [1970]).Nancy Spector1.

But to characterize him simply as an Earthwork artist would be to miss the depth of his vision, which lies in the interstices between sculpture, Land art, photography, film, and the written word. Throughout his tragically short career, Smithson mounted an attack against the strictures of art history, which venerates the static object and divides art from the exigencies of the real world. He searched for an aesthetic form that would be coterminous with the world at large. His nonsites, fragments taken from a landscape and framed within a gallery, broke down the polarity between inside and outside, leaving open the possibility of a third term that would contain both. Time and the phenomenon of entropy were central to his project, and photography was the perfect medium through which to capture the process and effects of duration. The act of photographinglike the activities of mapping, measuring, digging, pouring, mirroring, and writingwas an essential component of Smithsons practice. His photographic essay A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey (1967) describes tangible manifestations of entropic statesindustrial structures that were already deteriorating at the time of their construction.Hotel Palenque perfectly embodies the artists notion of a ruin in reverse. During a trip to Mexico in 1969, he photographed an old, eccentrically constructed hotel, which was undergoing a cycle of simultaneous decay and renovation. Smithson used these images in a lecture presented to architecture students at the University of Utah in 1972, in which he humorously analyzed the centerless, de-architecturalized site. Extant today as a slide installation with a tape recording of the artists voice, Hotel Palenque provides a direct view into Smithsons theoretical approach to the effects of entropy on the cultural landscape.While in Mexico, Smithson also created the Yucatan Mirror Displacements (19) by installing 12-inch-square mirrors on dispersed sites. The resulting series of nine color photographs was published in Artforum to accompany Smithsons essay Incidents of Mirror-Travel in the Yucatan (1969). The mirrors reflected and refracted the surrounding environs, displacing the solidity of the landscape and shattering its forms. Part Earthwork and part image, the displacements contemplate temporality; while the mirror records the passage of time, its photograph suspends time.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nVito Acconci's career-long exploration of the self has been articulated through poetry, photography, performance, film, video, installation, and architecture. What began as an investigation of the artist's own body in spacehow it interacts with a given environment and how, in turn, that location affects ithas evolved into the construction of space itself. This trajectory is inscribed from the private, photographic recording of the body in a designated site to his more recent creation of sites for public engagement. The relationship of the private to the publicand how the self participates in the surrounding worldhas been a constant theme in Acconci's art. In 1969, already a published poet, Acconci made his first visual artworks, moving from the static domain of the printed page to the dynamic space of the empirical world. Combining photographs with texts, the artist documented task-oriented activitiesjumping, stretching, bending, etc.that he performed specifically for the lens. In Grasp (1969), Acconci acknowledges the archival capabilities of photography\"camera as grasp, photo as storage\"but foregrounds the performative act of picture taking, of physically seizing an image. This project announces the dialogue between camera and body that is essential to Acconci's subsequent work, particularly in the series of videos and Super 8 films made between 1969 and 1974 in which he obsessively contemplates his own body as a (gendered) site. These privately filmed performances (which are also documented in photo/text panels) involve a level of corporeal manipulation that borders on masochismAcconci is shown plucking hairs from around his navel, throwing soapy water into his eyes, and cramming his fist in his mouth. In Conversions II (1971), the second in a trilogy of films interrogating the rigidity of gender binarism, the artist attempts to feminize his unquestionably male body by hiding his genitals between his legs. By casting his own masculinity into question, by performing its absence, Acconci problematizes the dictum that the male (or female) subject is a coherent being. Acconci's  TELE-FURNI-SYSTEM (1997), an installation designed for watching video (his own and those of other artists), invites each visitor to interact with the environment by choosing his or her own viewing positions from a menu of different architectural options. Each monitor serves as a separate video channel and a building block in the network of stairs, benches, and lounges that constitute the piece. Here it is the viewer who activates the space by physically engaging with it and contemplating the panoply of moving images on display. Nancy Spector\n",

She initially experimented with three-dimensional structures of neon tubing encased in narrow Plexiglas boxes, which emit an eerie, transcendental light without revealing the source and mechanisms that energize them. In 1968, Corse turned to the more traditional medium of painting on canvas. Of her signature White Light paintings, which are composed of miniscule glass beads embedded in acrylic paint, she explains, they create a prism that brings the surface into view. I like that because it brings the viewer into the light as well.  The iridescent surface of Light Painting (1971) engages the viewers perception by changing according to the angle from which it is seen. Despite the more conventional format, physical presence, and painstaking craftsmanship of her paintings, Corses central preoccupation is not form but light and the perception of the intangible.\nLauren Hinkson\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nEmploying only commercial fluorescent lights in his work, Dan Flavin devised a radical new art form that circumvented the limits imposed by frames, pedestals, or other conventional means of display. His embrace of the unadorned fluorescent fixture as an aesthetic object placed him at the forefront of a generation of artists whose use of industrial materials, emphasis on elementary forms, and nonhierarchical relationships among component parts became the salient characteristics of Minimalism.The additive composition of the nominal three (to William of Ockham), dedicated to the 14th-century English philosopher, exemplifies Flavins use of the fluorescent tube as a basic building block. The artists installations became increasingly complex while remaining bound to the limited palette and standard lengths in which the fixtures were commercially produced. His subsequent development of a vocabulary of corners, barriers, and corridors engaged the environment his work occupied and revealed his interest in reconceptualizing sculpture in relation to space. The first of his barrier pieces, greens crossing greens (to Piet Mondrian who lacked green), transforms and even inverts the conventional museum experience by literally invading the viewers space and prohibiting access to the gallery. The reference to Mondrian is in keeping with Flavins practice of dedicating individual works to family, friends, or historical figures of significance to him.The artist Mel Bochner credited Flavins practice as embodying an acute awareness of the phenomenology of rooms. This awareness stemmed from Flavins rejection of studio production in favor of site-specific situations or proposals (as the artist preferred to classify his work) and is nowhere more evident than in his 1971 installation for the Guggenheim, untitled (to Ward Jackson, an old friend and colleague who, during the Fall of 1957 when I finally returned to New York from Washington and joined him to work together in this museum, kindly communicated). Initially occupying one full turn of the museums ramps, and according to the artist, critically fitted to the inconsistent dimensions of the variable architecture, the work was conceived so that it could be extended to fill the entire rotunda, as was done in 1992. At that time, Flavin incorporated untitled (to Ward Jackson . . . ) into an new work dedicated to his fiancee, untitled (to Tracy, to celebrate the love of a lifetime), which featured a column rising from the rotunda floor in a celebratory manner, suffusing the space with a warm pink glow. Together these installations amplified the Frank Lloyd Wright interior, exemplifying Flavins career-long concern with light, space, and color.J. Fiona Ragheb\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the early 1960s Donald Judd abandoned painting, having recognized that actual space is intrinsically more powerful and specific than paint on a flat surface.1 His move into three dimensions was coincident with a growing acknowledgment among other artists of his generation of the physical environment as an integral aspect of an artwork. Minimalist sculpture broke with illusionistic conventions by translating compositional concerns into three dimensions, rendering the work a product of the exchange between the object, the viewer, and the environment.In his 1965 essay Specific Objects, Judd championed recent work that was neither painting nor sculpture by a diverse range of artists such as Lee Bontecou, Mark di Suvero, Claes Oldenburg, and Frank Stella. His endorsement of the thing as a whole rather than a composition of parts stemmed from what he saw as the strength and clarity asserted by singular forms, the unitary character of which resulted from the conflation of color, image, shape, and surface. Judds earliest freestanding sculptures were singular, boxlike forms constructed of wood or metal. The simple shape of Untitled (1968), with its slightly recessed upper surface, is readily intelligible as a whole and thus avoids the compositional effects that for Judd diluted a works power. As the artists exploration of three-dimensional space became more complex, his aversion to such effects was manifested in a number of strategies designed to subordinate a works individual components to the whole.Like the rectangular shape with which he began, Judds rows and progressions are legible systems that reoccur in his oeuvre. In its repetition of serial forms and spaces, the vertical stack of Untitled (1969) literally incorporates space as one of its materials along with highly polished copper, creating a play between positive and negative that coheres as a totality. Similarly, in Untitled (1970), the application of a dual Fibonacci progression (a mathematically based sequence in which each number is the sum of the two previous two: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and so on) imparts an internal logic to both solid and void alike, the anodized color of the boxes throwing the mathematical system into greater relief. While spatial concerns were foremost for Judd, color and materials always remained central to his conception of art. Sustained and rigorous investigations of space and form, his project is tempered by a rich palette of industrial materials, such as stainless steel, aluminum, and translucent Plexiglas, the varied surfaces and finishes of which lend a sumptuous air to an otherwise austere undertaking.J.

    "description": "\nDescription\nRobert Motherwell was only 21 years old when the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, but its atrocities made an indelible impression on him, and he later devoted a series of more than 200 paintings to the theme. The tragic proportions of the three-year battlemore than 700,000 people were killed in combat and it occasioned the first air-raid bombings of civilians in historyroused many artists to respond. Most famously, Pablo Picasso created his monumental 1937 painting Guernica as an expression of outrage over the events. From Motherwells retrospective view, the war became a metaphor for all injustice. He conceived of his Elegies to the Spanish Republic as majestic commemorations of human suffering and as abstract, poetic symbols for the inexorable cycle of life and death.Motherwells allusion to human mortality through a nonreferential visual language demonstrates his admiration for French Symbolism, an appreciation he shared with his fellow Abstract Expressionist painters. Motherwell was particularly inspired by the Symbolist poet Stephane Mallarmes belief that a poem should not represent some specific entity, idea, or event, but rather the emotive effect that it produces. The abstract motif common to most of the Elegiesan alternating pattern of bulbous shapes compressed between columnar formsmay be read as an indirect, open-ended reference to the experience of loss and the heroics of stoic resistance. The dialectical nature of life itself is expressed through the stark juxtaposition of black against white, which reverberates in the contrasting ovoid and rectilinear slab forms. About the Elegies, Motherwell said, After a period of painting them, I discovered Black as one of my subjectsand with black, the contrasting white, a sense of life and death which to me is quite Spanish. They are essentially the Spanish black of death contrasted with the dazzle of a Matisse-like sunlight. This and other remarks Motherwell made regarding the evolution of the Elegies indicate that form preceded iconography. Given that the Elegies date from an ink sketch made in 1948 to accompany a poem by Harold Rosenberg that was unrelated to the Spanish Civil War, and that their compositional syntax became increasingly intense, it seems all the more apparent that the meaning of each work in the series is subjective and evolves over time.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nLouise Nevelsons mature work emerged in the mid-1950s, when she began to assemble found wooden objects into constructions, most of which she painted uniformly black. In so doing she aligned herself with many contemporary artists who embraced found objects to create what has become known as Junk art, an aesthetic that stems from Pablo Picassos invention, early in this century, of a sculpture of accumulation. Nevelsons large-scale wall constructions reflect her interest in pre-Columbian stelae as well. The scale and formal purity of the all-black and all-white sculptures, in which the frontal relief surface and uniform coloration focus the viewer on the play of light and shadow, also suggest the solemnity and grandeur of altar paintings.In Luminous Zag: Night (1971), 105 units are filled with rows of saw-toothed wooden beams or, in approximately a dozen cases, with column fragments or jumbles of finials. A complicated rhythmic pattern, suggesting a fuguelike musical composition, is created by the play of vertical and horizontal zigzags. Like Piet Mondrians Broadway Boogie Woogie (194243), Nevelsons Luminous Zag: Night appears to be inspired by jazz music and its emphasis on improvisation within an established structure. The emphatic chiaroscuro of the zigzag blocks suggests the dynamism of Broadway at night. In an interview, Nevelson addressed the prominent use of the color black in her work, saying that its only an assumption of the western world that it means death, for me it may mean finished, completeness, maybe eternity.1White Vertical Water (1972) is the opposite of Luminous Zag: Night in terms of tension and tone. While the geometric regularity of the latter recalls urban architecture, the spontaneous irregularity of White Vertical Water evokes images of nature. The long undulating curves of the forms in the works narrow vertical boxes mimic the cascading streams of a waterfall or the froth of white water, while the biomorphic cutout layers in the upper-right squares, which recall the work of Jean Arp, suggest squirming fish. The materials and wall-like structure of Nevelsons monumental sculptures are akin to the fundamental elements of architecture, through which she created metaphorical analogies to urban and natural environments.Jennifer Blessing1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nThroughout his career, Robert Ryman has attempted to eliminate illusionism and outside references from his work, focusing instead on the fundamental properties of the materials he employs. He has confined himself to the color white, yet disclaims its importance. It was never my intention to make white paintings, he insisted in a 1986 interview with critic Nancy Grimes. And it still isnt. . . . The white is just a means of exposing other elements of the painting. These other elements include varieties of paint (oil and acrylic) and supports (canvas, paper, and metals), as well as the process of binding them. He investigates the properties of these elements methodically, yet responds spontaneously to the unpredictable exigencies caused by their interaction.Rymans Classico 4 is one of a series of compositions consisting of multi-panel paintings on a specific type of paper called Classico. For each work in the series, Ryman attached a configuration of heavy, creamy white sheets of the paper to a wall with masking tape, painted the sheets with a shiny white acrylic paint, removed the tape when the sheets were dry, mounted them on foamcore, and reattached them to the wall. The built-up paint edge tracing the outline of masking tape and the ripped paper left behind give witness to the process of creation. The various works in the Classico series differ in the organization of paper sheets, the configuration of tape traces, and the painted shape, yet they share an emphasis on the thinness of the support surface in its alignment with the wall and the monumentality conceived as an accumulation of parts.Just as the Classico works were titled after the type of paper used as a medium, the so-called Surface Veil works were named for the brand of fiberglass upon which the smaller pieces in this group were painted. Surface Veil I, II, and III are among four 12-foot square paintings from the series that were executed not on fiber-glass but on cotton or linen. In each of these works the pigment appears to form a membrane over the support due to the differing degrees of opacity and translucence in the white paint juxtaposed with areas where less of it has been applied, leaving the fabric exposed. These disruptions in the paintings skin often mark the literal pauses between the artists working sessions.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAndy Warhol announced his disengagement from the process of aesthetic creation in 1963: I think somebody should be able to do all my paintings for me, he told art critic G. R. Swenson.1 The Abstract Expressionists had seen the artist as a heroic figure, alone capable of imparting his poetic vision of the world through gestural abstraction. Warhol, like other Pop artists, used found printed images from newspapers, publicity stills, and advertisements as his subject matter; he adopted silkscreening, a technique of mass reproduction, as his medium. And unlike the Abstract Expressionists, who searched for a spiritual pinnacle in their art, Warhol aligned himself with the signs of contemporary mass culture. His embrace of subjects traditionally considered debasedfrom celebrity worship to food labelshas been interpreted as both an exuberant affirmation of American culture and a thoughtless espousal of the low. The artists perpetual examination of themes of death and disaster suggest yet another dimension to his art.Warhol was preoccupied with news reports of violent deathsuicides, car crashes, assassinations, and executions. In the early 1960s he began to make paintings, such as Orange Disaster #5 (1963), with the serial application of images revolving around the theme of death; this reiteration of the macabre also became the subject of print portfolios, as in Electric Chair (1971). When you see a gruesome picture over and over again, he commented, it doesnt really have any effect. Yet Electric Chair, with its eponymous chair printed once on each of ten separate sheets of paper, belies this statement. The work speaks to the constant reiteration of tragedy in the media, and becomes, perhaps, an attempt to exorcise this image of death through repetition. However, it also emphasizes the pathos of the empty chair waiting for its next victim, the jarring array of colors only accentuating the horror of the isolated, expectant seat.Warhols death and disaster pictures underscore the importance of the vanitas themethat death will take us allin his oeuvre. Self-Portrait (1986), one of the last self-portraits Warhol painted before his death, may be considered the anxious meditation of an aging artist. (Other works he painted in his final year include a posthumous portrait of Joseph Beuys, who died in 1986, and a rendition of Leonardo da Vincis Last Supper [149598].) The monumental scale of Self-Portrait suggests that Warhols obsession with celebrity encompassed himself. Yet unlike nearly all of his portraits, which commonly include the sitters neck and shoulders, this otherworldly image presents the artist as spectral, his acid green, disembodied head like a skull looming out of the black background.Jennifer Blessing1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nLawrence Weiner is a sculptor whose medium is language. His texts describe material processes and physical conditions; they delineate space and indicate location. Since 1968, when he concluded that the actual construction of a work was not critical to its existence in the world, Weiner has authored hundreds of linguistic artworks. Prior to this time, his material sculptures had been prefaced by titles that dictated the means of their fabrication. When the outdoor installation A SERIES OF STAKES SET IN THE GROUND AT REGULAR INTERVALS TO FORM A RECTANGLETWINE STRUNG FROM STAKE TO STAKE TO DEMARK A GRIDA RECTANGLE REMOVED FROM THIS RECTANGLE (1968) was damaged, Weiner realized that the essence of a work is textual and not physical. This led him to the following formulation, first published in 1968, which continues to outline his conceptual approach to artmaking: (1) The artist may construct the piece. (2) The piece may be fabricated. (3) The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of artist, the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership.1In a radical restructuring of the traditional artist/viewer relationship, Weiner shifted the responsibility of the work's realization to its audience, while also redefining standard systems of artistic distribution. A work such as A STAKE SET (1969) can be made or merely spelled out on a museum wall, but it can also be read in a book or heard if uttered aloud. Weiner's art can literally be disseminated by word of mouth. Much of the early work rehearses simple actions involving basic substancespouring paint, digging trenches, removing plasterand, like all subsequent examples, are stated in the past tense to avoid the authoritative tone of a command. Others are more spectacular, involving firecrackers and dynamite. THE RESIDUE OF A FLARE IGNITED UPON A BOUNDARY (1969), a piece that Weiner actually executed in Amsterdam for the Stedelijk Museum's pivotal 1969 Conceptual art exhibition Op Losse Schroeven: Situaties en Cryptostructuren (Square Pegs in Round Holes: Structures and Cryptostructures), is poetic in its ability to evoke vivid imagery, while at the time suggesting coded systems of communication. Weiner gradually extended his engagement with language to ready-made structures, such as idioms, cliches, and proverbs, which underscore the contingent nature of meaning when encountered in different contexts. The Christian burial recitation \"Earth to Earth, Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust\" becomes, in nonliturgical circumstances, a simple meditation on materials and processes of transmutation (EARTH TO EARTH ASHES TO ASHES DUST TO DUST [1970]).Nancy Spector1.

The arrangement of elements in this mysterious grouping suggests a natural site, like a forest clearing in which the stag (represented by an ironing board resting on wooden \"legs\"), the excremental forms of the \"primordial animals\" (actually made by plunging tools into piles of clay), and a goat (the hapless three-wheeled cart) are illuminated by a powerful lightning bolt (the weighty triangular form that hangs precariously from a beam). The artist is the human witness to this mythic, symbolic narrative (dominated, as always in Beuys's work, by animals), appearing obliquely in the form of the cast block of earth atop an old sculptor's modeling base.

    "description": "\nDescription\nWalter De Maria is best known for his 1977 Lightning Field. A rectangular grid in New Mexico measuring one mile by one kilometer and containing 400 stainless-steel lightning rods, it serves as an arena for observing meteorological activity. The artist also endeavored to bring such ordered experiences of the landscape into the gallery, translating distance, measure, and nature into abstract tableaux known as Earthrooms, in which accretions of soil, rocks, gravel, or peat fill the floors of architectural structures. De Marias reputation as an Environmental artistlinking him with Michael Heizer, Nancy Holt, and Robert Smithsonacknowledges only one facet of his challenging oeuvre. Less appreciated is De Marias early association with Fluxus and performance in San Francisco prior to his arrival in New York in 1960. From his exposure to the work of composer La Monte Young and dancer Simone Forti, among others, De Maria developed an interest in task-oriented, gamelike projects that resulted in viewer-interactive sculptures. For example, his Boxes for Meaningless Work (1961) is inscribed with the instructions, Transfer things from one box to the next box back and forth, back and forth, etc. Be aware that what you are doing is meaningless. The artist retained a participatory component, but only metaphorically, in his small-scale, polished-aluminum floor sculptures in shapes that possess significant iconic impactthe cross, the six-pointed star, and the swastika. The hollow interiors of the sculptures form narrow channels containing metal spheres. By including these seemingly movable balls, De Maria again evoked the notion of game-playing, but given the narrative association of the symbols, it seems an ironic gesture.Conceived of separately, but now often exhibited together, Cross, Star, and Museum Piece manifest how ancient symbolic configurations have undergone various interpretive transmutations: the cross, mark of Christianity, has also been discovered on ancient Egyptian tombs; the six-pointed star, sign of Judaism, first appeared on Bronze and Iron Age relics; and the swastika, emblem of Nazism, was once representative of prosperity, regeneration, and goodwill. By titling the swastika Museum Piece, De Maria seems also to have been commenting on the neutralizing effects of the museum environment, in which cultural artifacts, removed from their original contexts, can be reduced to visual equivalences.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

The work reads as a pun on Artforum, the name of the iconic art-industry journal.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the 1960s, the position that art could be generated by ideas rather than emotions was a radical one. Using mathematical and linguistic models, artists such as Hanne Darboven, Joseph Kosuth, and Lawrence Weiner began to explore the ramifications of this conceptual approach. For Sol LeWitt, this meant establishing systems of logic in the form of written instructionssuch as lines from the corner, sides, and center to points on a grid or all three-part variations on three different kinds of cubesthat govern the outcome of an artwork in advance of its execution. The clarity of this process minimizes the singular emphasis on the appearance of a work as a discrete object, instead mining the relationship between linguistic and visual conventions of representation. Indeed, the apparent simplicity of these textual systems, whether applied to LeWitt's wall drawings or his modular structures, belies a visual complexity of seemingly endless permutation and establishes a conceptual foundation for a rigorous yet rich body of work.Traditionally, the worked surface of a drawing has been understood as the most intimate and direct record of an artist's creative process; by leaving the execution to others, LeWitt ensures that his autographic touch is wholly absent. Wall Drawing #146 exemplified LeWitt's method of rendering the work a product of an intellectual gambit that functions via the possibilities posed by the instructions: All two-part combinations of blue arcs from corners and sides and blue straight, not straight, and broken lines. Constituting a dialectic between simplicity and complexity, austerity and sumptuousness, the mural surfaces of the artist's wall drawings operate in the gap between the logical and the lyrical.LeWitt's serial grammar rejects the authority invested in the singular in favor of the repeatable and nonhierarchical, while the impermanent nature of his wall drawings privileges the momentary over the monumental. In this, his work discounts many of the most cherished notions that pervade modernist accounts of art. Despite the conceptual strategies LeWitt devised to position form in the service of ideas, his work demonstrates that while concept may take primacy over its visual analogue, ultimately neither is in and of itself wholly sufficient.J.

    "description": "\nDescription\nBruce Nauman defies the traditional notion that an artist should have one signature style and a visually unified oeuvre. Since the mid-1960s the artist has created an open-ended body of work that includes fiberglass sculptures, abstract body casts, performances, films, neon wall reliefs, interactive environments, videos, and motorized carousels displaying cast-aluminum animal carcasses. If anything links such diverse endeavors, it is Nauman's insistence that aesthetic experience supersedes the actual object in importance. Perception itselfthe viewer's encounter with his or her body and mind in relation to the art objectcan be interpreted as the subject matter of Nauman's work. Using puns, claustrophobic passageways with surveillance cameras, and videotaped recitations of bad jokes, he has created situations that are physically or intellectually disorienting, forcing viewers to confront their own experiential thresholds.\nIn the early 1970s Nauman began producing roughly hewn architectural environments, including corridors and rooms made out of unpainted, industrial plywood, as a means of investigating the work of art as a performative arena or \"tension situation\"1 in which the space occupied by the viewer is not physically distinct from that of the art. These works, carefully planned and constructed according to Nauman's instructions, force the viewer to interact with and confront various unsettling spaces, which generate a heightened awareness of both the senses and the psychophysical limitations imposed by the built environment.\nComposed of plasterboard and wood, Floating Room (Light Outside, Dark Inside) (1972) is suspended from the ceiling so that its walls seem to float 15 centimeters above the gallery floor. The work implicates both the unlit interior of the floating room and the brightly lit space of the gallery in a play between the binaries of interior and exterior, light and darkness, safety and fear. The darkness of the floating room's interior suggests the possibility of unknown dangers. At the same time, its separation from the public gallery proffers a private, protected space to the visitor. Floating Room (Light Outside, Dark Inside) embodies Nauman's belief that \"both what's inside and what's outside determine our physical, physiological and psychological responseshow we look at an object.\"\n\r\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nLouise Nevelsons mature work emerged in the mid-1950s, when she began to assemble found wooden objects into constructions, most of which she painted uniformly black. In so doing she aligned herself with many contemporary artists who embraced found objects to create what has become known as Junk art, an aesthetic that stems from Pablo Picassos invention, early in this century, of a sculpture of accumulation. Nevelsons large-scale wall constructions reflect her interest in pre-Columbian stelae as well. The scale and formal purity of the all-black and all-white sculptures, in which the frontal relief surface and uniform coloration focus the viewer on the play of light and shadow, also suggest the solemnity and grandeur of altar paintings.In Luminous Zag: Night, 105 units are filled with rows of saw-toothed wooden beams or, in approximately a dozen cases, with column fragments or jumbles of finials. A complicated rhythmic pattern, suggesting a fuguelike musical composition, is created by the play of vertical and horizontal zigzags. Like Piet Mondrians Broadway Boogie Woogie (194243), Nevelsons Luminous Zag: Night appears to be inspired by jazz music and its emphasis on improvisation within an established structure. The emphatic chiaroscuro of the zigzag blocks suggests the dynamism of Broadway at night. In an interview, Nevelson addressed the prominent use of the color black in her work, saying that its only an assumption of the Western world that it means death, for me it may mean finish, completeness, maybe eternity.White Vertical Water is the opposite of Luminous Zag: Night in terms of tension and tone. While the geometric regularity of the latter recalls urban architecture, the spontaneous irregularity of White Vertical Water evokes images of nature. The long undulating curves of the forms in the works narrow vertical boxes mimic the cascading streams of a waterfall or the froth of white water, while the biomorphic cutout layers in the upper-right squares, which recall the work of Jean Arp, suggest squirming fish. The materials and wall-like structure of Nevelsons monumental sculptures are akin to the fundamental elements of architecture, through which she created metaphorical analogies to urban and natural environments.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

Two years later, at the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, The Hague, Netherlands, Flavin erected an artificial barrier of blue, red, and blue (to Flavin Starbuck Judd). As in the previous work, the wall-to-wall structure obstructs the viewer's movement, reflecting Flavin's expanding engagement with the full space of a room. The dedication in the title is to Donald Judd's son (whose name attests to the close friendship between the two artists at this time). In 1970, a related, larger barrier with the same blue-and-red palette was installed on the top floor of Judd's home and studio on Spring Street in the city of New York.Flavin's \"corridors\" also control and impede the movement of the viewer through gallery space. They take various forms: some are bisected by two back-to-back rows of abutted fixtures, a divider that may be approached from either side but not penetrated (the color of the lamps differs from one side to the other). The first such corridor, untitled (to Jan and Ron Greenberg), was constructed for a 1973 solo exhibition at the St. Louis Art Museum, and is dedicated to a local gallerist and his wife. It is green and yellow; a gap (the width of a single \"missing\" fixture) reveals the cast glow of the color from beyond the divide. In subsequent barred corridors, Flavin would introduce regular spacing between the individual fixtures, thereby increasing the visibility of the light and allowing the colors to mix. Ted Mann\n",

Elements of the decorsuch as masks or in this photograph, the Andy Warhol poster of Marilyn Monroeoften echo the belief in identity as a performance of a personal ideal, one that may be at odds with mainstream conceptions of gender.After finishing art school in 1978, Goldin moved to New York, where she continued to photograph her friendsartists and performers, denizens of the burgeoning East Village underground. By this time she was using color film and assembling her vast archive of slides into an ever-expanding show accompanied by an evocative music track, which she presented in clubs in the early 1980s. In her influential book, The Ballad of Sexual Dependency (1986), she focused on relationships and daringly portrayed her and her friends' passionate encounters. The Ballad, which includes portraits of individuals, images of separate and mixed-gender groups, and shots of coupling, partying, and violent acting out, suggests a passage from euphoria to dysphoria and back in an endless cycle of pleasure and pain. In Trixie on the cot, NYC, the artifice of her outfitthrift-shop party dress, heavy make-up, and doll-like hair ribbonsevokes an exaggerated femininity, a self-presentation that dovetailed with a growing mainstream questioning of gender. Greer and Robert on the bed, NYC, also from the book, hints at an inevitable discord between a heterosexual couple, but as in most of Goldin's work, their gender is mutable and fluid.Goldin's timely subject matter subsequently serves as a loving memorial to a community ravaged by drug addiction and AIDS. Formally, her deft use of lush color, as well as her large-scale (76.2 x 101.6 cm) Cibachrome prints, made Goldin both a leader in the phenomenal expansion of color photography into contemporary art in the 1980s as well as an inspiration for other artists through the 1990s.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nShortly after receiving an M.F.A. from Yale University in 1963, Robert Mangold worked as a guard at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Reminiscing about the months he spent there, Mangold commented that even the greatest paintings began to lose their appeal after hours of uninterrupted viewing. The Mondrians were the exception, however, and actually looked better and better over time.Inspired, perhaps, by Piet Mondrians reductivist tendency, Mangold emptied his painting of all external references, focusing instead on internal formal relationships. For this reason, his work is often described as Minimalist. But whereas much Minimalist painting and sculpture is premised on predetermined, mathematical progressions, rigid configurations, and industrial materials, Mangolds work is quite unsystematic. The difference between Mangolds art and that of many of his contemporaries lies in its idiosyncratic, intuitive nature. His geometric compositions are frequently distorted: what appears to be a perfect circle or square drawn on a two-dimensional surface is partially contorted in order to fit within the confines of the shaped canvases. While he has worked in series to explore the various permutations of such designs, Mangold has not limited himself to one specific strategy and often makes unique images. His palette, consisting of warm ochers, saturated blues, olive greens, and chocolate browns, among other hues, is more reminiscent of Italian frescoes than of the cool, detached tones and commercially mixed colors commonly used by artists associated with Minimalism.In 1973 Mangold created at least four versions of Circle In and Out of a Polygon; two were executed on canvas and two on Masonite. In all four the interior graphite line becomes interchangeable with the top, left, and bottom borders of the support. Similarly, half of the circle is outlined on the acrylic surface, while the other half continues as the curved edge on the paintings right. Mangold challenges his viewers to mentally reverse such images in order to comprehend the compositional nuances of the geometric abstraction. It is this emphasis on the conceptual basis of vision that truly links Mangold to the Minimalists, who brought their audiences to an unprecedented level of perceptual awareness.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1964, at New Yorks Green Gallery, Robert Morris exhibited a suite of large-scale polyhedron forms constructed from 2 x 4s and gray-painted plywood. This kind of simple geometric sculpture came to be called Minimalist because it seemed to be stripped of extraneous distractions such as figural or metaphorical reference, detail or ornament, and even surface inflection. Sculptures like the Untitled (Corner Piece), one component of the 1964 suite, boldly delineate the space in which they are located, thus defining the physical and temporal relationship of the viewer to the sculptural object.Morriss sculptures often consist of industrial or building materials such as steel, fiberglass, and plywood, and were commercially fabricated according to the artists specifications. The value of the artists handthe unique gesture that defines an individuals skill and stylewas inimical to Morris, and the work of art became, in theory, not an original object but a representation of the idea from which it was conceived. This notion allowed for the creation and destruction of a piece when necessary; Untitled (Corner Piece), for example, can be refabricated each time it is to be exhibited.In 1968 Morris introduced an entirely different aesthetic approach, which he articulated in an essay entitled Anti-Form. In this and later writings he reassessed his assumptions underlying Minimalist art and concluded that, contrary to earlier assertions, the construction of such objects had relied on subjective decisions and therefore resulted in iconsmaking them essentially no different than traditional sculpture. The art that he, Eva Hesse, Richard Serra, and others began to explore at the end of the 1960s stressed the unusual materials they employedindustrial components such as wire, rubber, and feltand their response to simple actions such as cutting and dropping. Untitled (Pink Felt) (1970), for example, is composed of dozens of sliced pink industrial felt pieces that have been dropped unceremoniously on the floor. Morriss scattered felt strips obliquely allude to the human body through their response to gravity and epidermal quality. The ragged irregular contours of the jumbled heap refuse to conform to the strict unitary profile that is characteristic of Minimalist sculpture. This, along with its growing referentiality, led Morriss work of the late-1960s and early 1970s to be referred to by such terms as Anti-Form, Process art, or Post-Minimalism.Jennifer Blessing\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nGeorge Segal was initially drawn to an expressive mode of figurative painting, but he ultimately developed a distinctive signature style that cleverly fused aspects of art and real life into large-scale sculptural tableaux. Segal studied at New York University with the painter William Baziotes and the sculptor Tony Smith. They encouraged Segal's interest in Abstract Expressionism, but he found it impossible to paint pure abstractions.\nSegal's friend Allan Kaprow, who famously initiated Happenings (performances, events, or situations that were often multidisciplinary), took him to one of the composer John Cage's classes at the New School for Social Research, New York. Segal credits Cage with calling his attention to the idea of connecting art with tangible reality. While Kaprow did just that in his Happenings, Segal decided not to participate in them, preferring permanent objects to ephemeral actions.\nAround 1958 Segal began to make sculpture that was \"off the pedestal\" and located in the space of life itself. In order to achieve his goals, he created plaster figures with an interior armature of chicken wire that he fleshed out with burlap dipped in plaster. He often stood these crude figures, whose heavily articulated surfaces almost seemed to be an analogue of Abstract Expressionist paintings, in proximity to paintings. In 1961 he was introduced to a new type of medical bandage being developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson. Using this new material, which was filled with plaster, Segal was able to make casts in pieces from live models. White and life-size, the resulting figures seem like ghostly presences despite their rough surfaces. Segal believed they have the impression of being real people in space, and he placed them within settings consisting of objects culled from a variety of sources. His subjects typically came from familiar, particularly American, surroundings. For example, in The Diner (196466), a waitress standing behind a counter pours coffee into a real cup for the male customer seated on an actual barstool.\nBy the 1970s Segal had transformed his means of producing figures yet again by using body casts as moulds into which he poured plaster or bronze to attain a smoother finish. Picasso's Chair (1973) belongs to this period, and it is part of a series of work from the early 1970s in which Segal paid homage to Pablo Picasso's Cubism.Picasso's Chair was inspired by a Picasso etching in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum's collection: Model and Surrealist Figure (Modele et sculpture surrealiste, 1933) (no. 74 from the Vollard Suite, [Suite Vollard]). According to Segal, the process of creating the work was illuminating:\nI was attracted to an etching as a blueprint from which I could build a genuine cubist sculpture. I cut out a piece of plywood and that was the wall, except that it was standing in pure space. I added one element on top of and in front of that the back plane, another element in front of that. . . . I discovered something extraordinary after I finished doing it. Using this pure Cubist technique to make an absolutely orthodox cubist work, I had replicated a proscenium stage and the precise method of seeing perspective in planes in receding space.1\nThe combination of an actual chair (discovered in a New Jersey antique shop) with found objects, including a household mop and musical notation paper (a stand-in for Picasso's shading), invites reflection on the intersections between various modes of representing depth in both two and three dimensions. As in Segal's other works, the cast of the nude woman, who in real life worked as a go-go dancer, serves as a bridge between \"real space\" and the artist's \"proscenium stage.\" While Picasso's original etching is not an integral part of the sculpture, Segal expressed a willingness to exhibit the work in conjunction with his piece, with the stipulation that the Picasso be hung on a different wall.1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nSince the beginning of her career in Belgrade during the early 1970s, Marina Abramovic has pioneered the use of performance as a visual art form. The body has always been both her subject and medium. Exploring the physical and mental limits of her being, she has withstood pain, exhaustion, and danger in the quest for emotional and spiritual transformation. This particular blend of epic struggle and self-inflicted violence was borne out of the contradictions of her childhood: both parents were high-ranking officials in the socialist government, while her grandmother, with whom she had lived, was devoutly Serbian Orthodox. Though personal in origin, the explosive force of Abramovic's art spoke to a generation in Yugoslavia undergoing the tightening control of communist rule.The tensions between abandonment and control are at the heart of her series of performances known as Rhythms (197374). In Rhythm 5 (1974), Abramovic lay down inside the blazing frame of a wooden star. With her oxygen supply depleted by the fire, she lost consciousness and had to be rescued by concerned onlookers. In Rhythm 10 (1973), she plunged a knife between the spread fingers of one hand, stopping only after she had cut herself 20 times. Having made an audio recording of the action, she then played back the sound while repeating the movementsthis time trying to coordinate the new gashes with the old. Using her dialogue with an audience as a source of energy, Abramovic created ritualistic performance pieces that were cathartic and liberating. In Rhythm 0 (1974), she invited audience members to do whatever they wanted to her using any of the 72 items she provided: pen, scissors, chains, axe, loaded pistol, and others. This essay in submission was played out to chilling conclusionsthe performance ceased when audience members grew too aggressive. Truly ephemeral, Abramovic's earliest performances were documented only by crude black-and-white photographs and descriptive texts, which she published as an edition years later, choosing the most iconic images to represent the essence of her actions. Since 1976 she has utilized video to capture the temporal nature of her art. Cleaning the Mirror #1 (1995) is composed of five stacked monitors playing videos of a haunting performance in which Abramovic scrubs a grime-covered human skeleton on her lap. Rich with metaphor, this three-hour action recalls, among other things, Tibetan death rites that prepare disciples to become one with their own mortality.Nancy Spector\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nLike his father, the Surrealist painter Roberto Sebastian Matta Echaurren, Gordon Matta-Clark studied to be an architect. While it never became his profession, architecturewith its inextricable relationship to private and public space, urban development and decaybecame his medium and subject matter. Using a practice that fused Conceptual arts critique of cultural institutionalization, Earth arts direct involvement with the environment, and performances engagement with sheer physicality, Matta-Clark literally sliced into abandoned buildings to create dizzying, Piranesian spaces sculpted from voids and fissures. By destructuring existing sites, he sought to reveal the tyranny of urban enclosure. The economic implications of private property are at play in Matta-Clarks Fake Estates, which incorporate deeds to microplots of landslivers of curbsides, and alleyways in Queensthat the artist bought at auction for 25 dollars a piece and combined with maps and montaged images of each site. Fascinated by the idea of untenable but ownable space, Matta-Clark purchased these residual parcels to comment on the arbitrariness of property demarcation.Conical Intersect, Matta-Clarks contribution to the Paris Biennale of 1975, manifested his critique of urban gentrification in the form of a radical incision through two adjacent 17th-century buildings designated for demolition near the much-contested Centre Georges Pompidou, which was then under construction. For this antimonument, or nonument, which contemplated the poetics of the civic ruin, Matta-Clark bored a tornado-shaped hole that spiraled back at a 45-degree angle to exit through the roof. Periscopelike, the void offered passersby a view of the buildings internal skeletons.Office Baroque, a lyrical cutting through a five-story Antwerp office building, was the artists second-to-last architectural project before his untimely death. Inspired by overlapping teacup rings left on a drawing, the carving was organized around two semicircles that arced rhythmically through the floors, creating a rowboat shape at their intersection. Matta-Clark described the piece as a walk through a panoramic arabesque. As in all his interventions, the building itself constituted the work of art. To counter the ephemeral nature of his sculptural gestures, he emulated their dynamic spatial and temporal qualities in unique photographs made by splicing and grafting negatives to create quasi-Cubistic images. No substitute for balancing precariously on the flayed edge of a structural cut, the photographs nevertheless document the essential aesthetic of Matta-Clarks anarchitecture.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nNo artist had a greater influence in revealing the artistic potential lurking behind television's flickering facade than Nam June Paik. Commonly hailed as the father of video art, Paik reshaped perceptions of the electronic image through a prodigious output of manipulated TV sets, live performances, global television broadcasts, single-channel videos, and video installations. His career took him from Asia through Europe to the United States, and Paik's complex media-based art grew out of his early interests in electronics, as well as his foundations in performance and music. Arriving in New York in the mid-1960s, he joined a new generation of artists that was altering the ways in which one interacts with the moving image. Paik became a prominent member of the Fluxus movement, whose principles included the transformation of quotidian actionslike the buttoning and unbuttoning of a coat, as seen in his video Button Happening (ca. 1965)into art. Quickly emerging at the forefront of this movement, Paik also sought to involve the viewer as an active participant in his performances and installations, and he often introduced elements of surprise and the unfamiliar.TV Garden, one of his seminal installations, illustrates Paik's profound grasp of technology's capacity for composition and the new aesthetic discourse that he helped to create. To enter the piece is to experience an uncanny fusion of the natural and the scientific, as hidden amid an undergrowth of live plants are video monitors of various sizes. All are playing the artist's 1973 collaboration with John J. Godfrey, Global Groove, which montages performers from around the world into a gyrating visual mix, and the videotape's sound track serves as musical and spoken counterpoint to the monitors' flickers of light. TV Garden set a new standard for immersive, site-specific video installations. Restaged for the artist's exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in 2000, its influence can be seen decades later in ambient, room-sized installations by such artists as Gary Hill and Bill Viola.For Paik, the artist should not be limited in seeking new forms of creative expression, but rather the potential for innovation must be continually reimagined. Just as Paik reconceived broadcast television in the 1960s and 1970s in order to turn it inside out and deliver a fresh take on this means of communication, Paik turned to laser technology as a novel type of sculptural and installation art at the beginning of the 21st century. He continued to dismantle customary ways of seeing and expand the parameters of art making throughout his career.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nOver the past forty years, Sigmar Polke has created complex works that have helped define the art of the time. In the 1960s, he forged a new, unique vision of German art, which during the postwar years had been largely derivative of gestural abstraction. During this time Polke began making his dot paintings, manually executed parodies of the Benday dot screens used by Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol. Although he shared visual strategies with American Pop artists, he was less concerned with appropriating the pictorial style of advertising than in depicting the desired objects of a consumer society. While at the Kunstakademie Dusseldorf in 1963, Polke and fellow students Konrad Lueg and Gerhard Richter consolidated their ideas of cultural criticism into a style they termed Capitalist Realism. The humorous and deliberately unskilled qualities of Polke's earliest works formalized a critique of both Socialist Realism and Pop art.During the 1970s, Polke slowed his art production in favor of travel to Afghanistan, Brazil, France, Pakistan, and the U.S., where he shot photographs and film footage that he would incorporate in his subsequent works during the 1980s. Using materials such as sheer synthetic fabrics, colored lacquers, and hydrosensitive chemicals in combination with paint, he began to self-consciously undermine the conventions of painting and to challenge its appropriateness as a medium to comment on contemporary life. Kathreiners Morgenlatte, with its layered composition incorporating fabric and painted imagery, is an example of this questioning. An image of a dull, domestic interior is superimposed over patterned swatches and clippings culled from the mass media, creating a formal metaphor for the complex layering of ideas found in postmodernism. To underscore his destruction of the traditional easel painting, Polke has apparently taken the wooden stretcher, cut it up and strewn the pieces over the surface of the work. Inverting his own name but signing Henri Matisse right side up, Polke ironically comments on the presumed necessity of including an accepted sign of high modernism in order to guarantee the authenticity and value of an artwork. By reconciling a complex group of references in Kathreiners Morgenlatte, Polke presents a critique of the condition of the artist and the impossibility of a sustained originality in contemporary art in the late 20th century.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe pursuit of new techniques has been a continuous theme of Rauschenbergs work. During a trip to Cuba in spring 1952, the artist first experimented with transfer drawings, taking printed images, primarily from newspapers and magazines, placing them face down on sheets of paper, and then rubbing the backs of the images with an empty ballpoint pen or other burnishing device to transfer the original to the paper. The technique, which Rauschenberg continues to use, has been described as imparting a veiled quality, which the artist heightens by applying paint, pencil, and crayon marks over the transferred images. Yellow Body exemplifies a technical development in which Rauschenberg applied a chemical solvent, such as lighter fluid, to the preprinted image, facilitating a clearer and more complete transfer.Both Untitled (1952) and Yellow Body demonstrate Rauschenbergs concentrated interest in the popular media and his practice of juxtaposing myriad recognizable images. The iconography of these works, which also recalls that of his early silkscreen paintings, includes modes of transportation, astronauts, athletes, and fragments of comic strips. Often an autobiographical reference will be part of this varied mix. Yellow Body includes images of fellow Port Arthur, Texas native Janis Joplin (whom Rauschenberg met in 1968 at the New York nightclub Maxs Kansas City) and Joplins band, Big Brother and the Holding Company.After his move to rustic Captiva Island off the Gulf Coast of Florida in 1970, Rauschenbergs focus shifted from urban and pop culture to an abstract idiom. He adopted unconventional materials, such as cardboard, paper bags, and silk, reflecting his consistently innovative approach to art making. By altering these materials only slightly, the artist emphasized their inherent colors and textures. Rauschenberg transferred newsprint to torn pieces of cheesecloth using an old Fuchs and Lang proofing press, which he had acquired shortly after his arrival in Captiva. The process not only transmitted visual texture but also a physical imprint, shaping the fabric into tail-like lengths to which the artist applied watercolor. For Untitled (1974), Rauschenberg then inserted the fabric between two sheets of paper, leaving the paper unadorned apart from the impression left by the form of the cheesecloth and his signature. The resulting kite is exhibited with only the paper pinned to the wall, allowing the fabric tails to catch the passing breeze.Joan Young\r\n        ",

Documenting the artists enduring interest in the act of perception are varied bodies of work through which he challenges typical art viewing experiences. Ranging from projections to built environments, Turrells pieces capitalize on the neutralizing power of spare spaces to create situations in which various encounters of natural and artificial light can be experienced in relative isolation. Turrells light works are a radical departure from artistic traditions such as representational painting, in which the aesthetic effects of light are described or mimicked. Eliminating the art object entirely, the artist instead uses light as his medium. While the simplicity of Turrells built environments is significant, this aesthetic quality is secondary to the artists interest in the viewers perception of light and space. \nAn amateur pilot, the artist finds inspiration in the ethereal interactions of light and space observed in the air and sometimes titles his works after meteorological phenomena witnessed in flight. While his pieces do not replicate the appearance of these airborne visual encounters, they allow viewers to access that elevated perspective and the accompanying perceptual experience. In nature, a virga is a wisp of precipitation that evaporates before reaching the earth. In Turrells Virga, the first work in his Veil series (1974 ), a white-surfaced rectangular chamber is accessed via a single central portal. At each end of the chamber, a ceiling aperture permits light to enter the room. Hidden in a superstructure behind each aperture are obliquely angled fluorescent lights that stream light through sharp-edged slits into the room below; skylights embedded in the superstructure admit daylight. As a result of this arrangement, crisp planes of light slice through the chamber, shaping the ends of the room into luminous triangular masses. Shimmering like an evaporating sheet of rain, these veils of light assume a fleeting materialitydissolving into space almost as soon as they appear. Since beams of sunlight mix with the fluorescent light, the clarity of the veils varies throughout the day as the quality of the exterior light changes. At night, Virga is stabilized by the lack of variable daylight and the consistency of the electrical light. As the planes of light oscillate between varying degrees of definition, the luminous wedges also fade in and out of focus, demonstrating the interdependence of light, space, and time.\nLindsay Ganter\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlthough often cited as the originator of Action Painting, an abstract, purely formal and intuitive means of expression, Willem de Kooning most often worked from observable reality, primarily from figures and the landscape. From 1950 to 1955, de Kooning completed his famous Women series, integrating the human form with the aggressive paint application, bold colors, and sweeping strokes of Abstract Expressionism. These female portraits provoked not only with their vulgar carnality and garish colors, but also because of their embrace of figural representation, a choice deemed regressive by many of de Koonings Abstract Expressionist contemporaries, but one to which he consistently returned for many decades.Composition serves as a bridge between the Women and de Koonings next series of work, classified by critic Thomas Hess as the Abstract Urban Landscapes (195558). According to the artist, the landscape is in the Woman and there is Woman in the landscapes. Indeed, Composition reads as a Woman obfuscated by de Koonings agitated brushwork, clashing colors, and allover composition with no fixed viewpoint. Completed while the artist had a studio in downtown New York, Compositions energized dashes of red, turquoise, and chrome yellow suggest the frenetic pace of city life, without representing any identifiable urban inhabitants or forms.Painted 20 years later, after de Kooning moved to East Hampton, New York, seeking to work in greater peace and isolation, ...Whose Name Was Writ in Water takes nature as its theme. Water was a favorite subject of the artist, and he devised a rapid, slippery technique of broad impasto strokes with frayed edges, speckled with drips, to convey its fluidity and breaking movement. The title, taken from an epigraph on Keatss tomb, which de Kooning had seen on a trip to Rome in 1960, is, according to critic Harold Rosenberg, the closest de Kooning can come to saluting overtly the impermanence of existence, and things in a state of disappearance. Always aiming to reinforce the content of his work with his technique, de Kooning reworked his canvases over and over again, making each painting a composite of evanescent visual traces. The scrambled pictorial vocabulary and condensed space of the urban landscapes was gradually diffused in de Koonings later work. More open compositions, a less cluttered palette, and looser, liquid brushstrokes reveal a painter relieved of the nervous, claustrophobic atmosphere of city life and newly at peace with his rural surroundings.Bridget Alsdorf\r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAt the beginning of the 1960s, Sol LeWitt produced pictorial reliefs that he called \"structures,\" a term adopted in order to underscore the work's fusion of elements of painting and sculpture. By the middle of the decade he had turned to the exploration of serial form in three-dimensional, gridlike structures and drawings. He developed a spare formal vocabulary consisting of the cube and the square that, when organized by pre-established systems, allowed for variations and permutations.\nWith the publication in 1967 of his essay \"Paragraphs on Conceptual art,\" LeWitt outlined a new direction in art, in which the systems shaping the object became the work itself and the object became an optional by-product. This privileging of concept over formmost memorably summed up in LeWitt's dictum \"The idea becomes a machine that makes the art\"1resulted in both a reconception of the status of the unique art object and a radical devaluing of the individual artist's mark.\nFor his wall drawings, the first of which he made in 1968, LeWitt limited himself to conceiving and planning the drawing, providing verbal instructions on a certificate and an accompanying diagram. Works such as Wall Drawing #264. A wall divided into 16 equal parts with all one-, two-, three-, and four-part combinations of lines in four directions and four colors. (first installed in Varese, July 1975) exist as a proposal on paper until they are executed by assistants, and the look of the final work is shaped by the architecture of the site, the size and texture of the wall, and the individual or individuals producing the drawing. This rigorously conceptual process of realization ensures that the autographic touch of the artist is wholly absent. Nevertheless, the wall drawings have the capacity to result in visually sensuous images.\nThe wall drawings can be executed in different placesthey may be painted out or re-created elsewhere. Several versions of the work may therefore exist over time; however, none will be identical. The impermanent nature of LeWitt's wall drawings privileges the momentary over the monumental. In this respect his work discounts many of the most cherished notions in modernist accounts of art.\n1. Sol LeWitt, \"Paragraphs on Conceptual Art,\" Artforum 5, no. 10 (June 1967), p. 80.\n",

While it never became his profession, architecturewith its inextricable relationship to private and public space, urban development and decaybecame his medium and subject matter. Using a practice that fused Conceptual arts critique of cultural institutionalization, Earth arts direct involvement with the environment, and Performance arts engagement with sheer physicality, Matta-Clark literally sliced into abandoned buildings to create dizzying, Piranesian spaces sculpted from voids and fissures. By destructuring existing sites, he sought to reveal the tyranny of urban enclosure. The economic implications of private property are at play in Matta-Clarks Fake Estates, which incorporate deeds to microplots of landslivers of curbsides, and alleyways in Queensthat the artist bought at auction for 25 dollars a piece and combined with maps and montaged images of each site. Fascinated by the idea of untenable but ownable space, Matta-Clark purchased these residual parcels to comment on the arbitrariness of property demarcation.Conical Intersect, Matta-Clarks contribution to the Paris Biennale of 1975, manifested his critique of urban gentrification in the form of a radical incision through two adjacent 17th-century buildings designated for demolition near the much-contested Centre Georges Pompidou, which was then under construction. For this antimonument, or nonument, which contemplated the poetics of the civic ruin, Matta-Clark bored a tornado-shaped hole that spiraled back at a 45-degree angle to exit through the roof. Periscopelike, the void offered passersby a view of the buildings internal skeletons.Office Baroque, a lyrical cutting through a five-story Antwerp office building, was the artists second-to-last architectural project before his untimely death. Inspired by overlapping teacup rings left on a drawing, the carving was organized around two semicircles that arced rhythmically through the floors, creating a rowboat shape at their intersection. Matta-Clark described the piece as a walk through a panoramic arabesque. As in all his interventions, the building itself constituted the work of art. To counter the ephemeral nature of his sculptural gestures, he emulated their dynamic spatial and temporal qualities in unique photographs made by splicing and grafting negatives to create quasi-Cubistic images. No substitute for balancing precariously on the flayed edge of a structural cut, the photographs nevertheless document the essential aesthetic of Matta-Clarks anarchitecture.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe pursuit of new techniques has been a continuous theme of Rauschenbergs work. During a trip to Cuba in spring 1952, the artist first experimented with transfer drawings, taking printed images, primarily from newspapers and magazines, placing them face down on sheets of paper, and then rubbing the backs of the images with an empty ballpoint pen or other burnishing device to transfer the original to the paper. The technique has been described as imparting a veiled quality, which the artist heightened by applying paint, pencil, and crayon marks over the transferred images. Yellow Body (1968) exemplifies a technical development in which Rauschenberg applied a chemical solvent, such as lighter fluid, to the preprinted image, facilitating a clearer and more complete transfer.Yellow Body demonstrates Rauschenbergs concentrated interest in the popular media and his practice of juxtaposing myriad recognizable images. The iconography of these works, which also recalls that of his early silkscreen paintings, includes modes of transportation, astronauts, athletes, and fragments of comic strips. Often an autobiographical reference will be part of this varied mix. Yellow Body includes images of fellow Port Arthur, Texas, native Janis Joplin (whom Rauschenberg met in 1968 at the New York nightclub Maxs Kansas City) and Joplins band, Big Brother and the Holding Company.After his move to rustic Captiva Island off the Gulf Coast of Florida in 1970, Rauschenbergs focus shifted from urban and pop culture to an abstract idiom. He adopted unconventional but generic materials, such as cardboard and fabric, reflecting his consistently innovative approach to art making. By altering their properties only slightly, the artist emphasized their inherent colors and textures. No longer employing either a hand or silkscreen process to transfer images, Rauschenberg now used an old Fuchs and Lang proofing press, which he had acquired shortly after his arrival in Captiva. The process not only transmitted visual texture but also a physical imprint. In the Hoarfrost series, Rauschenberg explored fabric as an unstretched support for imagery, applying the transfer process to such lustrous and diaphanous fabrics as silk, chiffon, and satin. These works, which are simply pinned to the wall, investigate the qualities of veiling and translucency as well as the natural draping quality of fabric first seen in the Combines such as Minutiae (1954) or Odalisk (1955/58), among others. As with many of Rauschenbergs series, the earlier works have a relatively colorless palette, but more colorful and legible imagery was later developed.Joan Young/Susan Davidson\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the increasingly theoretical New York art world of the 1960s and 1970s, painting was displaced in favor of sculpture in a new mode that privileged concept over material, idea over sensory quality. When painting did appear, the prevailing aesthetic called for pristine, monochromatic surfaces that appeared to have been untouched by the artists hand. Brice Marden departed from these stylistic strictures in search of something more emotionally charged and personal. His early single-color panels reconcile the stringent subtractions of Minimalism with his more expressive impulses as a painter. Upon close inspection, Mardens matte canvases, layered with thick encaustic (his characteristic oil-and-wax technique), reveal the marks of the palette knife, the subtle ridges in the viscous material inflecting each panels uniform color and opacity with impressions of the painters working process. This evidence, along with the artists anachronistic tendency toward the lyrical, is what distinguishes his work from that of his Minimalist contemporaries who rely on a cool industrial quality.Although Mardens paintings are non-objective, he often draws upon specific people, places, or other works of art as sources. Inspired by the austere palette of the Spanish masters Goya and Zurbaran, his early paintings achieve a brooding gravity through subtle, low-key color combinations. Dapres la Marquise de la Solana is a response to Goyas portrait of the Marquise, which Marden saw in the Louvre. His translation of the 18th-century figure into the language of reductivist abstraction is a potent distillation of the color, light, and mood in Goyas original. Delicately worked panels of olive-taupe, gray, and peach succinctly paraphrase the Marquises elusive expression and dainty poise amid a grand romantic landscape.An unparalleled sensitivity to color as an expressive means is a defining characteristic of Mardens art. The five paintings in the Grove Group series, begun in 1973, were inspired by an olive grove on the Greek Island of Hydra, where the artist has spent time. Marden, who sees art as a trampoline into spirituality, refers to these as high-intensity paintings, intending his use of light and color to elicit an emotional response from the viewer. Color associations are usually detectable only through Mardens evocative titles; the two-toned composition of Grove IV is a response to the shimmering shift in color from the dark tops to lighter bottoms of the windblown leaves of olive trees.Bridget Alsdorf\r\n        ",

A Cuban exile, Mendieta came to the United States in 1961, leaving much of her family behinda traumatic cultural separation that had a huge impact on her art. Her earliest performances, made while studying at the University of Iowa, involved manipulations to her body, often in violent contexts, such as restaged rape or murder scenes. In 1973 she began to visit pre-Columbian sites in Mexico to learn more about native Central American and Caribbean religions. During this time the natural landscape took on increasing importance in her work, invoking a spirit of renewal inspired by nature and the archetype of the feminine.\nBy fusing her interests in Afro-Cuban ritual and the pantheistic Santeria religion with contemporary practices such as earthworks, body art, and performance art, she maintained ties with her Cuban heritage. Her Silueta (Silhouette) series (begun in 1973) used a typology of abstracted feminine forms, through which she hoped to access an \"omnipresent female force.\"1 Working in Iowa and Mexico, she carved and shaped her figure into the earth, with arms overhead to represent the merger of earth and sky; floating in water to symbolize the minimal space between land and sea; or with arms raised and legs together to signify a wandering soul. These bodily traces were fashioned from a variety of materials, including flowers, tree branches, moss, gunpowder, and fire, occasionally combined with animals' hearts or handprints that she branded directly into the ground.\nBy 1978 the Siluetas gave way to ancient goddess forms carved into rock, shaped from sand, or incised in clay beds. Mendieta created one group of these works, the Esculturas Rupestres or Rupestrian Sculptures, when she returned to Cuba in 1981. Working in naturally formed limestone grottos in a national park outside Havana where pre-Hispanic peoples once lived, she carved and painted abstract figures she named after goddesses from the Taino and Ciboney cultures. Mendieta meant for these sculptures to be discovered by future visitors to the park, but with erosion and the area's changing uses, they were ultimately destroyed. Like the Siluetas, these works live on only through the artist's films and photographs, haunting documents of her ephemeral attempts to seek out, in her words, that \"one universal energy which runs through everything: from insect to man, from man to spectre, from spectre to plant, from plant to galaxy.\"\nNat Trotman\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nUnlike pictorial art that replicates visual experience through mimetic illusion, James Turrells light worksone cannot call these shimmering events objects or even imagesgive form to perception. Through sophisticated yet spare arrangements of natural light, artificial light, and built environments, his installations encourage a heightened sensory awareness and a state of self-reflexivity in which viewers can see themselves seeing, as the artist puts it.\nIn 1976 Turrell designed Iltar, one of earliest examples of the works he calls Space Division Constructions, along with five other works that together compose the Prado group (named after a set of Single Wall Projections that share a similar shape). Like all Space Division Constructions, these installations feature a bifurcated room; visitors peer into what the artist calls a sensing space through a large opening in the partition wall. This aperture bears a knife-sharp edge, and the light fixtures that flank it create blushes of electrical light in the viewing space. Turrell has compared the effect of these lights on the viewer to that of standing on a theatrical stage: under spotlights the audience disappears into an inky void, but outside the light a performer can see again. In the Space Division Constructions, this state of partial blindness contributes to the impression that the opening is actually a solid plane of color on the wall. Unlike some later works, Iltar features light sources only in the viewing space; the works gray-green tone is thus produced solely by ambient, reflected light controlled by the size and proportion of the aperture. \nNat Trotman and Nancy Spector\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe work of Carl Andre occupies an essential transitional position in contemporary art. The artist himself places it in a tradition spanning Constantin Brancusi to Henry Moore, yet historically it rests within the more recent context of ideational gestures, starting with the early paintings of Frank Stella. The Guggenheim Museum's collection covers a wide range of Andre's oeuvre, including the viewer-interactive 10 x 10 Altstadt Copper Square (1967), in which space is defined by both the work and the spectator, who is free to walk across it; Fall (1968), an angle of hot-rolled steel; and Trabum (Element Series) (1960; made 1977), a cube made of nine interlocking beams of Douglas fir. These examples embody the characteristic features of Andre's sculpture, such as the use of ready-made materials, the employment of modular units, and the articulation of three-dimensionality through a consideration of its negative as well as positive space. Andre has sought to reduce the vocabulary of 20th-century sculpture to basic phonemes such as squares, cubes, lines, and diagrams. In his avowed transition from the exploration of form to that of structure and of place, Andre has placed significant emphasis on the relation between site and viewer. His pseudoindustrial, untheatrical arrangements hover between being ideas and testing the limits of physical presence. Poetics plays an important role in Andre's work, manifested most literally by his experiments with linguistic equivalents to his sculpture. Since the 1960s he has created poems and, in the tradition of concrete poetry, situated the words on the page as if they were working drawings. He has often reached to ancient languages for titles in his attempt to craft a primordial language of form; for example, the title Trabum is derived from the Latin for log or timber. Andre's consistent search for the simplest, most rational models embodies a moral philosophy as well as an artistic practice. Cornelia Lauf\n",

Like that of her contemporaries Louise Lawler, Sherrie Levine, and Richard Prince, Charlesworth's work uses strategies of appropriation and reconstitution to critique systems of representation and reveal the ideological assumptions latent in the production and distribution of photographic images. For her 197779 series Modern History, she masked out the columns of text and headlines on photocopied images of newspaper front pages, leaving visible only the masthead and images. When the Red Brigade kidnapped the Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro, Charlesworth focused on how the image of a single event disseminated through different international papers. The prints comprising Herald Tribune: November 1977 (1977), on the other hand, collect the front pages of a single newspaper surveyed over the course of a month. The partial pages reveal an overriding predominance of war, weaponry, diplomatic events, and a privileged male presence in the newspaper. By displacing the primacy of language and focusing the viewer's attention on the graphic structures underlying the presentation of each newsworthy event, these works highlight the hierarchies of power at play in determining how and for whom a particular event is visually represented.

Martin used serial procedures and noncompositional strategies that involved intersecting or adjacent horizontal and vertical marks, and integrated the practices of painting and drawing.In the 1960 ink drawing Untitled #16, Martin formed an all-over pattern made of horizontal rows of dots and dash-like broken lines, overlaying larger elliptical shapes that both cancel and emphasize the optical vibrations created by her disjointed graphic marks. The stains of smudged ink, the irregularity of the dots, and the unevenness of the lines reflect the fragile contingency of the artists touch. A recurring motif in her early 1960s work, dot-dash patterns also appear in the painting White Flower (1960) and in the ink-and-pencil drawing Untitled (Drawing) #31 (1960), where vertical lines and horizontal dot-dash traces together form rectangles surrounded by an empty border. The blank frame, a common device in Martins practice, makes the drawn structure appear as a figure on a ground, disrupting the grids suggestion of infinite expansion. Enclosures and frames also play an important role in an untitled work from 1960 and Little Sister (1962). The everyday materials such as brass nails in Little Sister recall Martins 1950s planar constructions, which she built from found objects and later destroyed. Reminiscent of her dot-dash marks, the nail heads emphasize the materiality of the support and produce a staccato rhythm that thwarts the continuity of the unevenly drawn ink lines.In contrast to the early 1960s works, Martins late 70s watercolors feature lateral expanses of delicately colored washes rich in atmospheric effects. Two 1977 works on paper (both untitled) consist of wide, horizontal pencil lines and blue, pink, and yellow watercolor stains; the negative space created by a blank area is as important as the colors around it. They belong to a group of works Martin began after her 1973 retrospective at Philadelphias Institute of Contemporary Art, which marked the end of her six-year withdrawal from painting, and first showed in spring 1978 at the Pace Gallery in New York. Their luminous color washes emphasize the interdependence of color and form, opacity and transparency, and line and field by appearing to dissolve the geometry of the horizontal areas. Informed by her interest in Taoism, Zen Buddhism, and by her sensory memories and experiences of nature, especially of the Southwestern landscape, Martins paintings and drawings consist of sequences of cadenced variations of austere forms and engender a wide range of optical and textural allusions.

    "description": "\nDescription\nAgnes Martins earliest experiments with an abstract idiom were based on her observations of the desert terrain of New Mexico, where she lived during the 1940s. It was there that she developed a personal vocabulary of provocative, abstract formssimilar to the formative biomorphic or pictographic works of William Baziotes, Adolph Gottlieb, and Mark Rothkoat a time when American artists were searching for the aesthetic means to convey subjective states and to intimate the existence of other, higher realities. By 1960 Martin had developed her signature grid pattern; the compositional motifs of these pristine, monochromatic paintings consist of a simple system of interlocking horizontal and vertical lines in an almost exclusively six-foot-square format. The titles of these geometrically organized picturesMountains, Dark River, Starlight, Leaf in the Wind, Orange Grove, Spring, and White Flower, to cite just a fewattest to Martins persistent engagement with themes of the organic world, albeit in an abstract manner. At this time she distilled the appearance of empirical entities and expressed her own emotional response to nature through the most extreme economy of formal means. Anything, Martin claimed in 1972, can be painted without representation.\nUnlike the more rigidly formulaic art of much Minimalist work, there is nothing systematic about Martins use of the grid; the arrangement of coordinates shifts in scale and rhythm from work to work. The grid in White Flowercomposed of intersecting white lines that form individual rectangles punctuated by symmetrical white dashesresembles woven fabric. Consistent throughout Martins mature oeuvre is an absolute equivalence of form. The compositions are emphatically nonhierarchical; no one component is privileged over another. The delicacy of Martins stylepromoted by the artists frequent use of light graphite lines and cool tones such as pink and pale graymasks her impulse toward stringent formal equality. Her paintings must be read as unitary entities, not as assemblies of single elements. This does not mitigate the complexity of their construction, however. The freely drawn grids, fragile, almost dissolving lines, and hushed tones of the paintings require quiet contemplation in order for the subtleties of their individual compositions to be revealed.Nancy Spector\n",

Using a practice that fused Conceptual arts critique of cultural institutionalization, Earth arts direct involvement with the environment, and Performance arts engagement with sheer physicality, Matta-Clark literally sliced into abandoned buildings to create dizzying, Piranesian spaces sculpted from voids and fissures. By destructuring existing sites, he sought to reveal the tyranny of urban enclosure. The economic implications of private property are at play in Matta-Clarks Fake Estates, which incorporate deeds to microplots of landslivers of curbsides, and alleyways in Queensthat the artist bought at auction for 25 dollars a piece and combined with maps and montaged images of each site. Fascinated by the idea of untenable but ownable space, Matta-Clark purchased these residual parcels to comment on the arbitrariness of property demarcation.Conical Intersect, Matta-Clarks contribution to the Paris Biennale of 1975, manifested his critique of urban gentrification in the form of a radical incision through two adjacent 17th-century buildings designated for demolition near the much-contested Centre Georges Pompidou, which was then under construction. For this antimonument, or nonument, which contemplated the poetics of the civic ruin, Matta-Clark bored a tornado-shaped hole that spiraled back at a 45-degree angle to exit through the roof. Periscopelike, the void offered passersby a view of the buildings internal skeletons.Office Baroque, a lyrical cutting through a five-story Antwerp office building, was the artists second-to-last architectural project before his untimely death. Inspired by overlapping teacup rings left on a drawing, the carving was organized around two semicircles that arced rhythmically through the floors, creating a rowboat shape at their intersection. Matta-Clark described the piece as a walk through a panoramic arabesque. As in all his interventions, the building itself constituted the work of art. To counter the ephemeral nature of his sculptural gestures, he emulated their dynamic spatial and temporal qualities in unique photographs made by splicing and grafting negatives to create quasi-Cubistic images. No substitute for balancing precariously on the flayed edge of a structural cut, the photographs nevertheless document the essential aesthetic of Matta-Clarks anarchitecture.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe dark of night laps at the edges of The Gleaner (1978), a fire burns on the upper left, and a sunlike shape hovers beneath the lone figure. Yet Georg Baselitz's monumental, somber work was painted during a decade of well-being in Germany, when the generation of the wirtschaftswunderthe economic miraclewas interrupted in its relentless quest for stable prosperity only by the occasional political scandal or terrorist attack. How does this image, so clearly a representation of an existentialist condition, address the complex issues facing postwar German art and society?The key lies in the orientation of the gleaner, searching for sustenance in a barren landscape: the figure is depicted upside down. Baselitz has used this device consistently since 196970, his intention being, in part, to subvert the criteria for viewing paintings. To this end, Baselitz inverts, and thus negates, the subjects of his work. He cites but does not pay homage to the mythic protagonists that, as in Wagner's epic operas, have so often been the focus of German art and culture. For Baselitz, the individual is the locus of redemption and the cause for despair. He has painted a great number of his antiheroes in guises ranging from military costumes to stark nudity.Baselitz once termed his technique a nonstyle. The upside-down figure, brutality of gesture, and emotive yet distanced strokes have, however, long since become highly recognizable trademarks. Ironically, Baselitz, who initially sought to replace the congealed Expressionism sweeping Europe with a fresh, aggressive style, and comparably controversial subjects, is now regarded as one of the foremost German artists and has been accorded retrospective exhibitions internationally. His work strongly influenced the generation of painters that came of age during the early 1980s. But unlike the Neo-Expressionists he inspired, Baselitz does not rehash past styles, nor is his milieu truly international. Baselitz's painting remains a deeply felt and authentic engagement with the spiritual depletion of the postwar period in Germany.Cornelia Lauf\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nSpanning performance, sculpture, film, and drawing, Ana Mendieta's work revolves around the body, nature, and the spiritual connections between them. A Cuban exile, Mendieta came to the United States in 1961, leaving much of her family behinda traumatic cultural separation that had a huge impact on her art. Her earliest performances, made while studying at the University of Iowa, involved manipulations to her body, often in violent contexts, such as restaged rape or murder scenes. In 1973 she began to visit pre-Columbian sites in Mexico to learn more about native Central American and Caribbean religions. During this time the natural landscape took on increasing importance in her work, invoking a spirit of renewal inspired by nature and the archetype of the feminine.\nBy fusing her interests in Afro-Cuban ritual and the pantheistic Santeria religion with contemporary practices such as earthworks, body art, and performance art, she maintained ties with her Cuban heritage. Her Silueta (Silhouette) series (begun in 1973) used a typology of abstracted feminine forms, through which she hoped to access an \"omnipresent female force.\"1 Working in Iowa and Mexico, she carved and shaped her figure into the earth, with arms overhead to represent the merger of earth and sky; floating in water to symbolize the minimal space between land and sea; or with arms raised and legs together to signify a wandering soul. These bodily traces were fashioned from a variety of materials, including flowers, tree branches, moss, gunpowder, and fire, occasionally combined with animals' hearts or handprints that she branded directly into the ground.\nBy 1978 the Siluetas gave way to ancient goddess forms carved into rock, shaped from sand, or incised in clay beds. Mendieta created one group of these works, the Esculturas Rupestres or Rupestrian Sculptures, when she returned to Cuba in 1981. Working in naturally formed limestone grottos in a national park outside Havana where pre-Hispanic peoples once lived, she carved and painted abstract figures she named after goddesses from the Taino and Ciboney cultures. Mendieta meant for these sculptures to be discovered by future visitors to the park, but with erosion and the area's changing uses, they were ultimately destroyed. Like the Siluetas, these works live on only through the artist's films and photographs, haunting documents of her ephemeral attempts to seek out, in her words, that \"one universal energy which runs through everything: from insect to man, from man to spectre, from spectre to plant, from plant to galaxy.\"\nNat Trotman\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nBefore 1962, when the mirror replaced the canvas in Michelangelo Pistolettos work, he painted searching self-portraits to express a sense of cultural desolation and personal isolation. Concurrently, Pistoletto attempted to tackle what was perceived in some postwar art circles as the bankruptcy of traditional pictorial form. It was a moment of great tension and no solution, he explained. I had to find a way out of this dramatic situation of an art that reflected the need to recapture some indication of how to continue. Increasingly, the artist varnished the backgrounds of these portraits, thus creating reflective surfaces, and the decision to employ actual mirrors followed. For the initial incarnation of the mirror pieces, he silkscreened photographic images of men and women on highly polished steel plates. The life-size and lifelike figures seem to be observing a phantasmic world beyond the looking glass. As viewers, we encroach upon what seems to be their private space as our own reflections peer back from the picture. In actuality, it is the very space we occupy. The uneasy shift between reality and representation is startling. For Pistoletto, the introduction of the mirror provided a liberating aesthetic strategy that ventured far beyond the play between art and life, pursued to varying degrees by other members of the Arte Povera group. While the depicted figures are frozen in time, the reflective surfaces are infused with potentiality and indeterminacy. This temporal element, captured in the concept of the fourth dimension, is fundamental to Pistolettos art. So is an appreciation of the semantic distinction between the definitions of reflection: the word denotes both the occurrence of a visual likeness and the act of mental contemplation. Within this term is located the congruity between seeing and thinking, a phenomenon at the core of Pistolettos conceptual project.By the mid-1970s the artist had extended his experiments to create split reflective surfaces that, in essence, mirror themselves in an endless repetition of their own forms. Pistoletto also fragmented the mirror, breaking the reflected image into pieces and thereby exposing the deceptive nature of mimetic representation. Broken Mirror, as part of the larger Division and Multiplication of the Mirror series, is an elegant and challenging example of the artists meditation on the nature of reflection and representation.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nCindy Shermans Untitled Film Stills (197780) have been canonized as a hallmark of postmodernist art, which frequently utilized mass-media codes and techniques of representation in order to comment on contemporary society. In this series of 69 black-and-white photographs, Sherman posed herself in various melodramatic guises that recall the stereotypical feminine characters presented in 8 x 10 publicity stills for B-grade movies from the 1950s and 1960s. The personae she created range from ingenue lost in the big city to martini-wielding party girl to jilted lover to hausfrau. Untitled Film Still, #15 (1978) depicts the tough girl with a heart of gold. Contrary to the media images they appropriate, which may require a transparent sense of realism to sell an illusion, Shermans stills have an artifice that is heightened by the often visible camera cord, slightly eccentric props, unusual camera angles, and by the fact that each image includes the artist, rather than a recognizable actress or model.In the early 1980s Sherman continued to explore stereotypes of femininity and female representation found in popular culture, such as the centerfold format of pornographic magazines. She also began to use color in her work; her painterly sensibility is apparent in Untitled, #112 (1982) and subsequent photographs. Untitled, #112 is also one of the first images in which the artist portrays a more masculine identity. This gender ambiguity, along with the way the unusually lit figure emerges from the black background, yields an unsettling sensation. These effects become ominous and even frightening in later works in which Sherman portrays more disheveled and malign characters.Untitled, #167 (1986) is from Shermans Disasters series, which directly investigates grotesque and disgusting subject matter. The sense of foreboding elicited by earlier works is more overt, suggesting the terror of horror films (a genre that significantly focuses on female victims). Untitled, #167 depicts the scene of a gruesome crime. Emerging from the dirt are the nose, lips, and red-painted fingertips of a blonde, apparently female, victim. A discarded Polaroid photographic sheath suggests documentation (either by a police officer or perhaps the villain, whose reflection appears in an open makeup compact), and obliquely implicates the artist as photographic voyeur. The very darkness of the image and the reflectiveness of the photographs surface make it difficult for the viewer to scrutinize the scene. Untitled, #167 foreshadows Shermans use of prosthetic body parts in her later works, as well as the gradual elimination of her own likeness.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1977 Richard Prince lined up four advertisements for home furnishings torn from the New York Times Magazine, rephotographed them, and presented them as Untitled (living rooms)a deceptively simple gesture that represented not only a decisive breakthrough in his own practice, but a cornerstone of the postmodernist assault on conventions of authorship and originality. The artist's day job in the tear-sheet department of Time Life Publications allowed him to immerse himself in a world of consumer aspiration, as he scoured the discarded pages for images of fashion models, popular brands, and luxury goods, from which he cropped out all text and logos to reveal a series of highly codified visual tropes. In the triptych Untitled (jewels, watch and pocketbook), high-end accessories are positioned against a background of foliage and bathed in a beatific golden lightan attempt to invoke the natural world that only highlights the bizarre artifice of this carefully orchestrated act of seduction. At the same time that these appropriated photographs undermine the manipulative strategies of the advertising industry, their alien beauty exerts a mesmerizing appeal, exhibiting a simultaneous embrace and critique of mass culture that is at the core of Prince's art.In 1985, Prince adapted his appropriative method to a new series in which recycled jokes are silkscreened across monochromatic canvases, evoking a deadpan, off-the-shelf aesthetic. Jokes are a highly ritualistic form of social exchange, and in Prince's hands these apparently trivial statements find renewed power as cultural signifiers, focusing on gender stereotypes, sexual anxiety, and family dysfunction. My Neighbor exemplifies a later, more subtly allusive iteration of Prince's Jokes, in which the canvas is swathed in successive layers of mottled pigment and the gag line hand-stenciled in broken snatches so that it hovers on the periphery of legibility. A similar trajectory toward a more gestural style can be traced in the ongoing series of sculptures that Prince initiated in the late 1980s, which appropriate fiberglass car hoods advertised in the back pages of muscle-car magazines. While Prince farmed out his earliest Hoods to body shops to achieve a slick commercial finish, in more recent works such as Children, he uses their surfaces as supports for expressionistic hand-painting. Oscillating between the conditions of painting and sculpture, these abstracted objects retain the visceral associations of their origins, evoking the reckless allure of the open road and an attendant, prototypically American fantasy of rebellion and escape.\n",

Ivy with Marilyn, Boston, from this body of work, presages her subsequent groundbreaking color images in content and style. In this portrait of a person with whom the artist is personally involved, made on the scene, rather than in a studio, Ivy, a pre-op transsexual, embodies the gender ambiguity that Goldin found so liberating. Goldin frequently portrays her subjects, which include herself, in their homes or socializing in clubs and bars. Elements of the decorsuch as masks or in this photograph, the Andy Warhol poster of Marilyn Monroeoften echo the belief in identity as a performance of a personal ideal, one that may be at odds with mainstream conceptions of gender.After finishing art school in 1978, Goldin moved to New York, where she continued to photograph her friendsartists and performers, denizens of the burgeoning East Village underground. By this time she was using color film and assembling her vast archive of slides into an ever-expanding show accompanied by an evocative music track, which she presented in clubs in the early 1980s. In her influential book, The Ballad of Sexual Dependency (1986), she focused on relationships and daringly portrayed her and her friends' passionate encounters. The Ballad, which includes portraits of individuals, images of separate and mixed-gender groups, and shots of coupling, partying, and violent acting out, suggests a passage from euphoria to dysphoria and back in an endless cycle of pleasure and pain.

    "description": "\nDescription\nAndy Warhol announced his disengagement from the process of aesthetic creation in 1963: I think somebody should be able to do all of my paintings for me, he told critic G. R. Swenson. Warhol, like other Pop artists, used found printed images from newspapers, publicity stills, and advertisements as his subject matter; he adopted silkscreening, a technique of mass reproduction, as his medium. And unlike the Abstract Expressionists, who searched for a spiritual pinnacle in their art, Warhol aligned himself with the signs of contemporary mass culture. His embrace of subjects traditionally considered debasedfrom celebrity worship to food labelshas been interpreted as both an exuberant affirmation of American culture and a thoughtless espousal of the low.News reports of violent deathsuicides, car crashes, assassinations, and executionspreoccupied Warhol and added another dimension to his art. In the early 1960s he began to make paintings, such as Orange Disaster #5, with the serial application of images revolving around the theme of death. Orange Disaster #5, with its electric chair repeated 15 times, speaks to the constant reiteration of tragedy in the media, and becomes, perhaps, an attempt to exorcise this image of death through repetition. However, it also emphasizes the pathos of the empty chair waiting for its next victim.The image of Marilyn Monroe first appeared in the artist's work during 1962 and, along with portraits of Jackie Kennedy, constitutes the artist's best-known celebrity subject. Evidencing Warhol's lifelong preoccupation with the media icon, One Hundred and Fifty Multicolored Marilyns reveals his fascination with notoriety and doomed beauty. Here, the moody palette and thick application of paint are more expressively devastating than early portraits of the same subject and perhaps relate to the artist's reflection upon his own mortality.\n",

The arrangement of elements in this mysterious grouping suggests a natural site, like a forest clearing in which the stag (represented by an ironing board resting on wooden \"legs\"), the excremental forms of the \"primordial animals\" (actually made by plunging tools into piles of clay), and a goat (the hapless three-wheeled cart) are illuminated by a powerful lightning bolt (the weighty triangular form that hangs precariously from a beam). The artist is the human witness to this mythic, symbolic narrative (dominated, as always in Beuys's work, by animals), appearing obliquely in the form of the cast block of earth atop an old sculptor's modeling base. Completed in 1985 (the year of the artist's death), this important work was acquired by the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in 2001 and re-presented in a new installation in February 2002.Meghan Dailey\n",

Although photography is their exclusive medium, the prize was granted in another categorysculpture. This ingenious gesture by the Biennale jury testifies to the artists' success in creating an art form that falls beyond existing aesthetic parameters.Starting in 1957 the Bechers traveled throughout Europe and North America taking black-and-white photographs of industrial architecture: water towers, coal silos, blast furnaces, lime kilns, grain elevators, preparation plants, pithead gears, oil refineries, and the like. They organized their photographs into series based exclusively on functional typologies and arranged them into grids or rows. This served both to invoke and reinforce the sculptural properties of the architecturethey called the subjects of their photographs \"anonymous sculptures\"the forms of which are primarily determined by function. Through this method the artists revealed the diverse structural and material variations found within specific kinds of edifices. The water towers comprising the sequence presented here, for example, are all constructed of metal, yet they differ vastly in form. Such differences are underscored by constants that prevail from series to series: the photographs are usually taken from the same angle, the light is evenly distributed, and the prints are identical in size.The photographs, particularly those of now-demolished structures, refer to specific historical periods, particularly the late-19th-century shift to industry. When contemplated in our postindustrial society, these images can be interpreted as nostalgic ruminations on a lost era. But they do not lack a critical edge. The intense and obsessive nature of the Bechers' project mirrors and discloses the relentless order of industrial production, a phenomenon that has had monumental implications for the economy and the environment.The serial repetition of the Bechers' work, coupled with its focus on industrialization, has inspired comparisons to Minimalism. The artists, who avoided any form of categorization, would not necessarily condone such an analogy. It is telling, however, that one of the finest appreciations of the Bechers to have been written is by Minimalist sculptor Carl Andre.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nBarbara Kruger juxtaposes photographs culled from the mass media with pithy slogans in a vigilantly constructed attack on the ways in which self-identity, desire, and public opinion are manipulated and perpetuated. Her often caustic presentationsranging from billboards, T-shirts, and posters to the signature red-bordered montages of words and imagesplay on cliches and cultural stereotypes to underscore and, eventually, undermine the persuasive power of representation. Distinctively feminist in orientation, the work also examines how gender difference is reinforced through media presentation. Traditionally, women have been displayed in film and advertising as objects of desire for the male viewer. The exception occurs when women are targeted by the media as consumers; only then do they become subjects, but merely as patrons of desirable images of themselves.Kruger brings the issue of gender identification into question through her ambiguous use of the neutral pronouns I, you, and we in her phrases, such as the following: YOUR GAZE HITS THE SIDE OF MY FACE; YOU MAKE HISTORY WHEN YOU DO BUSINESS; YOU INVEST IN THE DIVINITY OF THE MASTERPEICE; WHEN I HEAR THE WORD CULTURE, I TAKE OUT MY CHECKBOOK. To some extent, Kruger reconfigures the conventional gendered subject/object relationship by bestowing the female voice with authority, but quickly subverts this mere reversal of power by scrambling the identities of speaker and audience.Untitled (Not Perfect) is an early example of Krugers mature work; it marks the transitional period between the artists provocative, embroidered wall hangings and her photographic pieces. It is best understood when examined in concert with another work from 1980, Untitled (Perfect), in which the word perfect is written across an image of a womans discreetly sweatered torso; her hands are clasped as if in prayer. In contrast to this image of chaste proprietysuggestive of the socially condoned behavior often required of womenNot Perfect depicts a pair of soiled male hands resting in a washbasin. The word stain, albeit crossed out, points to the questionable source of the hands discoloration. Is it spilled coffee or dirt or blood? Although intentionally indecipherable, the image suggests the sense of recklessness, adventure, and destruction stereotypically associated with the male in our culture.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nTo create his art, Richard Long walks hundreds of miles for days, even weeks at a time, through uncultivated areas of land: the countryside of England, Ireland, and Scotland; the mountains of Nepal and Japan; the plains of Africa, Mexico, and Bolivia. He documents these journeys with captioned large-scale photographs, maps, and lists of descriptive terms, which are exhibited as individual works. While traveling, Long sets specific tasks for himself, such as traversing an absolutely straight line for a predetermined distance, following the side of a river wherever it may lead, or picking up and then dropping stones at certain intervals along the way. While on these trips, the artist interacts with the landscape by creating modest sculptures from indigenous materials, thus attesting to his presence in the land. Circles or linesLongs signature motifsrubbed into the ground by repeated footprints or composed of assembled stones, driftwood, or seaweed are eventually dissolved by the wind, the rain, and rising tides, thus negating human dominance over nature. His photographs remain the only evidence of these organic sculptures after erosion has run its course. Unlike other artists who have manipulated the landscape to create Earthworks, such as Walter De Maria, Michael Heizer, Robert Morris, Dennis Oppenheim, Robert Smithson, and James Turrell, Long does not significantly alter the terrain by digging, burrowing, sculpting, or constructing. He simply adjusts natures placement of rocks and wood to subtly demarcate geometric shapes.Long translates his deeply personal experiences in the wilderness into sculptures and mud drawings that are created for exhibition spaces and private collections. Pieces composed of flint, slate, feathers, pine needles, sticks, and other rustic materials become metaphors for the paths taken on his ramblings: the spirals, circles, and lines, if extended beyond the gallery walls, would trace actual distances traveled by the artist. The sculptures are not, therefore, representations of nature per se but rather aesthetic documents of Longs engagement with the land and poetic evocations of the beauty and grandeur of the earth. Such is the case with Red Slate Circle, which consists of 474 stones from a New York State quarry. When it is installed in the Guggenheims rotunda, the monumental ring echoes the buildings unique spiral while conjuring images of vast canyons, still lakes, and stone pathways leading into the distance.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nRobert Mapplethorpe emerged as an artist in New York in the 1970s amid two simultaneous but disparate events: the rise of the market for photography as a fine art, and the explosion of punk and gay cultures. Originally trained in painting and sculpture, Mapplethorpe gravitated toward photography, first making erotic collages in 1969 to 1970 with images cut from magazines, then creating his own photographs using a Polaroid camera. Within a few years he was exhibiting erotic male and female nudes, still lifes of flowers, and celebrity portraits, all made with a large-format camera. By the late 1970s his work had developed into a style that was classical and stylish. He continued to explore explicit homoerotic themes, and his subject matter made his work a lightning rod for the contentious debates on public funding for the visual arts during the 1980s.\nAlthough he occasionally worked with color, Mapplethorpe remained devoted to the minimal elegance of black-and-white photography, using the medium in part as an agent to explore certain paradoxes and binary relationships. In many of his works, for example, the distinction between male and female is problematized. In his two Self Portrait photographs of 1980, the artist blurs his gender identity by appearing in one image in partial drag, his face dramatically made-up, and in another as a sneering, smoking greaser archetype. Juxtaposing conventional signs for man and womanphysical, cosmetic, and sartorialMapplethorpe questions established notions of \"male\" and \"female,\" revealing their status as socially constructed terms.

    "description": "\nDescription\nRobert Mapplethorpe emerged as an artist in New York in the 1970s amid two simultaneous but disparate events: the rise of the market for photography as a fine art, and the explosion of punk and gay cultures. Originally trained in painting and sculpture, Mapplethorpe gravitated toward photography, first making erotic collages in 1969 to 1970 with images cut from magazines, then creating his own photographs using a Polaroid camera. Within a few years he was exhibiting erotic male and female nudes, still lifes of flowers, and celebrity portraits, all made with a large-format camera. By the late 1970s his work had developed into a style that was classical and stylish. He continued to explore explicit homoerotic themes, and his subject matter made his work a lightning rod for the contentious debates on public funding for the visual arts during the 1980s.\nAlthough he occasionally worked with color, Mapplethorpe remained devoted to the minimal elegance of black-and-white photography, using the medium in part as an agent to explore certain paradoxes and binary relationships. In many of his works, for example, the distinction between male and female is problematized. In his two Self Portrait photographs of 1980, the artist blurs his gender identity by appearing in one image in partial drag, his face dramatically made-up, and in another as a sneering, smoking greaser archetype. Juxtaposing conventional signs for man and womanphysical, cosmetic, and sartorialMapplethorpe questions established notions of \"male\" and \"female,\" revealing their status as socially constructed terms. In a similar fashion, Mapplethorpe's 1985 Self Portrait collapses other supposed dualisms by picturing himself with hornsa sign pointing to the concepts of good and evil central to both Christian and Greek mythology and embodied by figures such as Satan, the Bible's fallen angel, and Dionysus, a Greek god associated with hedonism and sexual desire.

Consisting of a concrete basin filled with cobalt chloride (which perpetually changes color in response to shifting levels of humidity in the room), the work reveals much about Zorios concerns as an artist as well as his place within the development of contemporary Italian art. In art-historical terms, Pink-Blue-Pink refers to the works of the Italian enfant terrible Piero Manzoni, who used cobalt chloride in some of his radical wall pieces (known as Achromes) in order to redefine painting and its traditional role as a conveyor of predetermined meanings. Pink-Blue-Pink marks a continuation of the attempt to reconfigure arts role in society by demonstrating its essential malleability. The emphasis on instability and metamorphoses apparent in Pink-Blue-Pink would become the leitmotif of Zorios subsequent artistic undertakings. Drawing upon the ancient science of alchemy for both form and content, he has created an oeuvre in which materials associated with chemical conversionsvessels containing water, alcohol, acids, and copper sulfate connected by suspended copper conduitshave become symbols for psychic and social transmutation. Zorios belief in the potential for cultural change through art is apparent in the title Per purificare le parole (To Purify Words), which he has applied to numerous sculptures and performances since 1968.Zorios notion that language can be emptied of all extraneous or corrupt facets finds a visual analogue in his work, which can be reduced to an essential symbolic typology that he combines and recombines. His fundamental aesthetic vocabulary consists of the star, which alludes to the metaphysical; the javelin, which represents mortal power; and the canoe, which suggests passage between the two realms. However utopian this project may seem, one remains aware that danger and violence constitute the underside of beauty and of harmony. Perhaps this is why Zorio pierced the broken terra-cotta star with a javelin in Star (To Purify Words). Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the late 1960s, Chuck Close transformed a photograph of himself into a monumental black-and-white painting. Working for months, he drew a grid over the photo and transferred that compositional structure to a canvas, systematically focusing on the individual parts that make up a whole far exceeding the scale of the original image. Close wanted a picture that could not be taken in all at once, but rather had to be viewed in sections. He also aimed to capture how the camera sees by including both blurry and highly detailed areas. To create an impersonal surface lacking traces of the artists hand, he applied a small amount of acrylic paint to a gessoed surface and used such tools as an airbrush, razor blades, and electric drills.In later portraits, he painted family members and friends, anonymous subjects (although many later became famous) except for their first names, which served as titles. In order to distinguish his approach from traditional portraiture, Close referred to these passportlike images as heads and focused on each faces topographic qualities that sometimes included unflattering details. His use of mechanical reproduction (the camera) and the grid reflected an affinity with Minimalism. Yet, the machine is not the maker; rather, he used it as a tool for realizing hand-painted pictures.By the early 1970s, Close began making color portraits, developing a layering technique inspired by photo-mechanical reproductions and experimenting with colored pencil, pastel, and watercolor. In 198081, he made his first large portrait in oil paint, a medium he had not used since 1966. He made two versions of this painting, Stanley (Large Version), the one in the Guggenheims collection and a smaller version. The subject of this picture is Stanley Rosen, a salesman whom Close met at the beach where the two mens children were playing together. First shown in Close Portraits (1981) at the Whitney Museum of American Art, it garnered critical interest because of its rich dialogue between abstraction and representation. In contrast to his earlier works smooth surfaces, Stanley (Large Version) consists of a network of colored dots rendered in a fluid, painterly manner. The abstract patterning in the grids squares recalls the mosaic-like technique of Gustav Klimt, whose work the artist studied while in Vienna on a Fulbright fellowship in the mid-1960s. Closes turn to a more articulated treatment of the surface hearkened back to his early interest in Abstract Expressionism, and coincided with many other artists decision to work in an expressionist painting style. However, Close did not allow emotion and spontaneity to govern his practice. Instead, he continued to use photography as a departure point and follow systematic rules, combining regimentation and freedom in the same work.Valerie Hillings\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nTerremoto means earthquake in Italian; more specifically, on November 23, 1980, it meant the destruction of a small city on the volcanic heights above Naples. At the invitation of a Neapolitan cultural center, Beuys and several other artists made works to commemorate the lost lives and other effects of the disaster. The Guggenheim Museum's Terremoto (1981), constructed in Rome at roughly the same time, is a pendant to the Neapolitan work. Although its title and date tie it specifically to the Neapolitan earthquake, it also refers to a contemporary political situation.This installation reiterates Beuys's public support of independence for this region of Italy. An Italian flag, wrapped in felt, is draped against an ancient typesetting machine that was once used in the production of the newsletter of a leftist political party, Lotta Continua (The fight continues). Grease has been smeared on the keys of the machine, rendering them dysfunctional. A blackboard on the floor leans against a small oil drum, as if elemental lessons would suffice to educate people to the inequities of capitalism. More blackboards form an altar around the printing machine. They bear alchemical symbols and chalk drawings of skulls, which might represent the victims of the quake.The manifestos glued to the printing machine refer to the Action Third Way, a theory of political activism that Beuys helped to develop in the late 1970s; it argues for an economic system based neither on the values of Western capitalism nor on the monopolies of the state created by 20th-century interpretations of Marxism. One important element of the Third Way is an emphasis on ecology. Beuys alludes to this in Terremoto by opposing technology with organic substances, and printed texts with handwritten ones. He developed this further in the larger environmental installations dating from the last years of his career, which are among his most far-reaching works, enormous in scope, magnificent in their intention, and involving hundreds of participants. They center around a single theme: his call for a change in thinking that develops out of personal understanding rather than from technological advances.Cornelia Lauf\n",

Unadorned and set directly on the floor without a pedestal, it is in fact not so much a sculpture as the material of gold itselfthe simple physical reality of the stuff, in the artists words. The daughter of a pawnbroker, Horn has been fascinated with gold since her childhood, specifically with how it has been invested with so many layers of mythological and economic significance. In Gold Field, she sought to strip away these cultural associations to allow viewers to experience the material unmediated, as a visual and tactile thing. That is not to say, however, that the work precludes metaphorical readings. Rather, as fellow artist Felix Gonzalez-Torres observed, it is waiting for the right viewer willing and needing to be moved to a place of the imagination. For Gonzalez-Torres, who first encountered Gold Field at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, in 1990, at a time when his lover Ross was dying of AIDS and amid what he perceived to be an almost hopeless social and political climate, the piece had a deeply personal resonance: it represented a new landscape, a possible horizon, a place of rest and absolute beauty . . . a place to dream, to regain energy, to dare.1Ted Mann1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nSpanning performance, sculpture, film, and drawing, Ana Mendieta's work revolves around the body, nature, and the spiritual connections between them. A Cuban exile, Mendieta came to the United States in 1961, leaving much of her family behinda traumatic cultural separation that had a huge impact on her art. Her earliest performances, made while studying at the University of Iowa, involved manipulations to her body, often in violent contexts, such as restaged rape or murder scenes. In 1973 she began to visit pre-Columbian sites in Mexico to learn more about native Central American and Caribbean religions. During this time the natural landscape took on increasing importance in her work, invoking a spirit of renewal inspired by nature and the archetype of the feminine.\nBy fusing her interests in Afro-Cuban ritual and the pantheistic Santeria religion with contemporary practices such as earthworks, body art, and performance art, she maintained ties with her Cuban heritage. Her Silueta (Silhouette) series (begun in 1973) used a typology of abstracted feminine forms, through which she hoped to access an \"omnipresent female force.\"1 Working in Iowa and Mexico, she carved and shaped her figure into the earth, with arms overhead to represent the merger of earth and sky; floating in water to symbolize the minimal space between land and sea; or with arms raised and legs together to signify a wandering soul. These bodily traces were fashioned from a variety of materials, including flowers, tree branches, moss, gunpowder, and fire, occasionally combined with animals' hearts or handprints that she branded directly into the ground.\nBy 1978 the Siluetas gave way to ancient goddess forms carved into rock, shaped from sand, or incised in clay beds. Mendieta created one group of these works, the Esculturas Rupestres or Rupestrian Sculptures, when she returned to Cuba in 1981. Working in naturally formed limestone grottos in a national park outside Havana where pre-Hispanic peoples once lived, she carved and painted abstract figures she named after goddesses from the Taino and Ciboney cultures. Mendieta meant for these sculptures to be discovered by future visitors to the park, but with erosion and the area's changing uses, they were ultimately destroyed. Like the Siluetas, these works live on only through the artist's films and photographs, haunting documents of her ephemeral attempts to seek out, in her words, that \"one universal energy which runs through everything: from insect to man, from man to spectre, from spectre to plant, from plant to galaxy.\"\nNat Trotman\n1.

While the artist most famously used found commercial photographs as source material for silkscreen paintings of celebrities, disasters, and other subjects, he also worked from his own images. From the 1970s until his death, Warhol made tens of thousands of Polaroid prints, a method that appealed to him because of its speed, ease, and flattening effects. Polaroids served as working studies for his commissioned society portraits; however, many were never adapted into silkscreens, but remained experimental, intimate prints that the artist preserved in his files. Among these was a series of self-portraits in drag, on which Warhol collaborated with photographer Christopher Makos in the early 1980s. These cross-dressing performances for the camera recall Man Ray's photographs of Duchamp disguised as his female alter ego, Rrose Selavy. Warhol had a longstanding interest in drag queens, and more broadly, in artifice, role-playing, and the construction of identity. In his numerous self-portraits, he was less interested in revealing himself than in presenting a mask, just as he carefully cultivated a superficial, depthless celebrity persona in life. Nevertheless, in this image, his masculine features are barely disguised behind his wig and make-up, resulting in a poignant testament to vulnerability and exposure.Ted Mann\n",

Despite his variation, Welling's oeuvre often focuses on the tension between imagination and reality. Part of a 1981 series of images with evocative titles such as Wreckage, Island, and The Waterfall, In Search Of . . . is an image that hovers between abstraction and representation, between documentary and formalist strategies modernist subject matter filtered through a postmodern lens. A swath of dark fabric sweeps downward in an elegant gesture, its folds littered with white flakes conjuring thoughts of snow, broken pottery, or a nocturnal terrain. A wealth of allusions spills from the image, and yet, Welling tempers these connotations with the banal reality of the subject matter: a velvet curtain strewn with crushed phyllo dough. The curtain itself mimics the dialectical structure of the image itself: a gesture toward theatricality and the idea of something hidden, it simultaneously refers to the revealing, quotidian drape on which still lifes are displayed.

Rather than documenting real buildings, however, Casebere fabricates tabletop models in his studio using manufactured materials like Foamcore and Styrofoam. His versions of stores, suburban housing, factories, and government buildings remain empty of detail and human figures. In the important early work Storefront, with its bare window displays of a generic store, only the dim overhead light suggests any sign of life in a scene that appears otherwise abandoned. Yet even the light elicits a ghostlike quality, casting a pallid glow on the cold geometry of a structure that is both indistinct and hauntingly familiar. The artist has suggested that this work references the financial circumstances of the 1980s that buoyed large corporations while bankrupting smaller businesses. \nLauren Hinkson\n",

The scenes he photographs are taken not from life, however, but from tabletop models constructed of such materials as Styrofoam, foamcore board, plaster, and white paint. Through dramatic lighting, he creates a convincing sense of volume and expanse. Subdivision with Spotlight (1982) features a suburban street, lit in such a way as to suggest night; indeed, were it not for the ominous spotlight referred to in the title, the illumination of the buildings might well be taken for moonlight. The photograph first appeared in Casebere's artists book titled In the Second Half of the Twentieth Century . . . (1982), facing Caseberes introduction, which reads in full:\n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century American children often had toys they played with and learned from. They went to school, did chores, grew up, left home to prove themselves, and sometimes made homes of their own. \n    \n    (These things try to go on forever.)1\nThe text is an implicit critique of a social system that trains its youth to become passive consumers. Casebere also quotes Thomas Paine (the accumulation of personal property is, in many instances, the effect of paying too little for the labor that produced it) and reproduces a statistical table from the New York Times detailing, for example, the number of city buses that could be constructed for the amount of money it takes to build a certain number of army tanks. By considering Subdivision with Spotlight in relation to the politics of the book, one discerns the themes that have been central to Caseberes work throughout his career: namely, American history, the way in which built space has the power to control and shape ones identity, and a questioning of the photographs status as a record of the real.Claire Barliant1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nBetween 1972 and 1974, Nan Goldin shot black-and-white photographs of her friends at The Other Side, a drag bar in Boston, in her words to pay homage to those whose third gender . . . made more sense than either of the other two. Ivy with Marilyn, Boston, from this body of work, presages her subsequent groundbreaking color images in content and style. In this portrait of a person with whom the artist is personally involved, made on the scene, rather than in a studio, Ivy, a pre-op transsexual, embodies the gender ambiguity that Goldin found so liberating. Goldin frequently portrays her subjects, which include herself, in their homes or socializing in clubs and bars. Elements of the decorsuch as masks or in this photograph, the Andy Warhol poster of Marilyn Monroeoften echo the belief in identity as a performance of a personal ideal, one that may be at odds with mainstream conceptions of gender.After finishing art school in 1978, Goldin moved to New York, where she continued to photograph her friendsartists and performers, denizens of the burgeoning East Village underground. By this time she was using color film and assembling her vast archive of slides into an ever-expanding show accompanied by an evocative music track, which she presented in clubs in the early 1980s. In her influential book, The Ballad of Sexual Dependency (1986), she focused on relationships and daringly portrayed her and her friends' passionate encounters. The Ballad, which includes portraits of individuals, images of separate and mixed-gender groups, and shots of coupling, partying, and violent acting out, suggests a passage from euphoria to dysphoria and back in an endless cycle of pleasure and pain. In Trixie on the cot, NYC, the artifice of her outfitthrift-shop party dress, heavy make-up, and doll-like hair ribbonsevokes an exaggerated femininity, a self-presentation that dovetailed with a growing mainstream questioning of gender. Greer and Robert on the bed, NYC, also from the book, hints at an inevitable discord between a heterosexual couple, but as in most of Goldin's work, their gender is mutable and fluid.Goldin's timely subject matter subsequently serves as a loving memorial to a community ravaged by drug addiction and AIDS. Formally, her deft use of lush color, as well as her large-scale (76.2 x 101.6 cm) Cibachrome prints, made Goldin both a leader in the phenomenal expansion of color photography into contemporary art in the 1980s as well as an inspiration for other artists through the 1990s.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1963, prompted by the proliferation of media-generated imagery in the contemporary landscape, Gerhard Richter and fellow artists Konrad Lueg (a.k.a. Konrad Fischer) and Sigmar Polke founded Capitalist Realism as a critique of consumer culture. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Richter continued to use media images to explore the relationship between painting and photography. Working in a wide range of approaches, from figuration and landscapes to gestural abstractions and monochromes, the artist has evaded the normative discourse of art history.Richter has stated, I am suspicious regarding the image of reality which our senses convey to us and which is incomplete and limited, and his insistence on the illusionistic nature of painting has led to a painterly practice that underscores the mediated experience of reality by incorporating imagery based on found and familiar photographs. Atlas, a vast compilation of such imagery begun in 1962, attests to the importance of the photographic in his oeuvre. Photographs, in his view, provide a pretext for a painting, injecting a measure of objectivity and eliminating the processes of apprehension and interpretation. While not based on a specific photographic source, the mirrorlike forms of Passage, with their muted palette and formal austerity, exemplify a lack of emotive presence in keeping with the artist's efforts to demystify the traditions of high culture.In 1976, Richter's picturesso called by the artist in order to avoid an emphasis on the painterlymade a decisive move toward abstraction in a series of richly polychromed canvases. Given his conviction that pure painting is ridiculous anyway, Richter turned again to photography as a means to mediate the highly subjective bent of abstract painting, creating small sketches that he photographed and translated into large-scale canvases. While continuing in this style, he eventually dispensed with the photographic intermediary. The highly gestured surfaces of works such as Korn can thus be best understood not as expressive paintings in the shadow of Abstract Expressionism, but as part of an ongoing project to contest the venerated tropes of authenticity and subjectivity. \r\n\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nCindy Shermans Untitled Film Stills (197780) have been canonized as a hallmark of postmodernist art, which frequently utilized mass-media codes and techniques of representation in order to comment on contemporary society. In this series of 69 black-and-white photographs, Sherman posed herself in various melodramatic guises that recall the stereotypical feminine characters presented in 8 x 10 publicity stills for B-grade movies from the 1950s and 1960s. The personae she created range from ingenue lost in the big city to martini-wielding party girl to jilted lover to hausfrau. Untitled Film Still, #15 (1978) depicts the tough girl with a heart of gold. Contrary to the media images they appropriate, which may require a transparent sense of realism to sell an illusion, Shermans stills have an artifice that is heightened by the often visible camera cord, slightly eccentric props, unusual camera angles, and by the fact that each image includes the artist, rather than a recognizable actress or model.In the early 1980s Sherman continued to explore stereotypes of femininity and female representation found in popular culture, such as the centerfold format of pornographic magazines. She also began to use color in her work; her painterly sensibility is apparent in Untitled, #112 (1982) and subsequent photographs. Untitled, #112 is also one of the first images in which the artist portrays a more masculine identity. This gender ambiguity, along with the way the unusually lit figure emerges from the black background, yields an unsettling sensation. These effects become ominous and even frightening in later works in which Sherman portrays more disheveled and malign characters.Untitled, #167 (1986) is from Shermans Disasters series, which directly investigates grotesque and disgusting subject matter. The sense of foreboding elicited by earlier works is more overt, suggesting the terror of horror films (a genre that significantly focuses on female victims). Untitled, #167 depicts the scene of a gruesome crime. Emerging from the dirt are the nose, lips, and red-painted fingertips of a blonde, apparently female, victim. A discarded Polaroid photographic sheath suggests documentation (either by a police officer or perhaps the villain, whose reflection appears in an open makeup compact), and obliquely implicates the artist as photographic voyeur. The very darkness of the image and the reflectiveness of the photographs surface make it difficult for the viewer to scrutinize the scene. Untitled, #167 foreshadows Shermans use of prosthetic body parts in her later works, as well as the gradual elimination of her own likeness.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

Welchs folksy, hand-crafted fabrication of a full-size 1958 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz is juxtaposed against the characteristically aerodynamic design of the actual vehicle in chrome and steel. The car is parked facing a movie screen supported by a framework also consisting of branches, on which fragments of 1950s and 1960s films such as The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957) and The Time Machine (1960) are projected. The Second Feature continues themes explored in Welchs Drive-In (1980), an installation of a 1939 Rolls Royce Phantom III made from similar materials and positioned facing a movie screen showing 1950s movie trailers and soda and popcorn ads. In his Drive-In installations, Welch creates an extraordinary object out of ordinary materials, stripping from the Cadillac and the Rolls Royce their symbolic identities as icons of American freedom, British wealth, and Western industrialism. Encompassing Welchs consistent themes of popular culture, time, and memory, the car and movie screen in Drive In: Second Feature are relics of postWorld War II America.  Now a piece of collectible nostalgia, the Cadillac acts as a portal into a lost world.\nGillian Canavan\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nRobert Mapplethorpe emerged as an artist in New York in the 1970s amid two simultaneous but disparate events: the rise of the market for photography as a fine art, and the explosion of punk and gay cultures. Originally trained in painting and sculpture, Mapplethorpe gravitated toward photography, first making erotic collages in 1969 to 1970 with images cut from magazines, then creating his own photographs using a Polaroid camera. Within a few years he was exhibiting erotic male and female nudes, still lifes of flowers, and celebrity portraits, all made with a large-format camera. By the late 1970s his work had developed into a style that was classical and stylish. He continued to explore explicit homoerotic themes, and his subject matter made his work a lightning rod for the contentious debates on public funding for the visual arts during the 1980s.\nAlthough he occasionally worked with color, Mapplethorpe remained devoted to the minimal elegance of black-and-white photography, using the medium in part as an agent to explore certain paradoxes and binary relationships. In many of his works, for example, the distinction between male and female is problematized. In his two Self-Portrait photographs of 1980, the artist blurs his gender identity by appearing in one image in partial drag, his face dramatically made-up, and in another as a sneering, smoking greaser archetype. Juxtaposing conventional signs for man and womanphysical, cosmetic, and sartorialMapplethorpe questions established notions of \"male\" and \"female,\" revealing their status as socially constructed terms. In a similar fashion, Mapplethorpe's 1985 Self-Portrait collapses other supposed dualisms by picturing himself with hornsa sign pointing to the concepts of good and evil central to both Christian and Greek mythology and embodied by figures such as Satan, the Bible's fallen angel, and Dionysus, a Greek god associated with hedonism and sexual desire. In other works Mapplethorpe juxtaposes black nudes with emphatically white objectsa shroud, marble statuary, flowers, or, in the case of Ken Moody and Robert Sherman (1984), another male.\nIn photographs of nude models and sculptural objects such as Apollo (1988) and Italian Devil (1988), Mapplethorpe both literally and formally drew on classical sculpture. The blending of sculpture and photography in his work represents both a classical search for perfectiona word Mapplethorpe used frequentlyand an attempt to collapse the two mediums into a single practice. He once claimed, \"If I had been born one or two hundred years ago, I might have been a sculptor, but photography is a very quick way to see, to make sculpture.\"1\nIn his haunting Self-Portrait of 1988, Mapplethorpe blended sculpture with his own image. Unlike earlier self-portraits in which he assumed various personae such as rocker, leather fetishist, cross-dresser, and fashion plate, this photograph, taken about a year before his death due to complications of AIDS, has a more somber mood. The artist's gaunt face peers out from a black background and appears to be floating in space. The seemingly disembodied head simultaneously suggests his physical deterioration and formally echoes the sculpted skull that serves as the handle of his cane. A modern day vanitas image, this work suggests the powerful connection between art and life as well as Mapplethorpe's own transitory existence.\nMatthew Drutt\n1.

Juxtaposing conventional signs for man and womanphysical, cosmetic, and sartorialMapplethorpe questions established notions of \"male\" and \"female,\" revealing their status as socially constructed terms. In a similar fashion, Mapplethorpe's 1985 Self-Portrait collapses other supposed dualisms by picturing himself with hornsa sign pointing to the concepts of good and evil central to both Christian and Greek mythology and embodied by figures such as Satan, the Bible's fallen angel, and Dionysus, a Greek god associated with hedonism and sexual desire. In other works Mapplethorpe juxtaposes black nudes with emphatically white objectsa shroud, marble statuary, flowers, or, in the case of Ken Moody and Robert Sherman (1984), another male.\nIn photographs of nude models and sculptural objects such as Apollo (1988) and Italian Devil (1988), Mapplethorpe both literally and formally drew on classical sculpture. The blending of sculpture and photography in his work represents both a classical search for perfectiona word Mapplethorpe used frequentlyand an attempt to collapse the two mediums into a single practice. He once claimed, \"If I had been born one or two hundred years ago, I might have been a sculptor, but photography is a very quick way to see, to make sculpture.\"1\nIn his haunting Self-Portrait of 1988, Mapplethorpe blended sculpture with his own image. Unlike earlier self-portraits in which he assumed various personae such as rocker, leather fetishist, cross-dresser, and fashion plate, this photograph, taken about a year before his death due to complications of AIDS, has a more somber mood. The artist's gaunt face peers out from a black background and appears to be floating in space. The seemingly disembodied head simultaneously suggests his physical deterioration and formally echoes the sculpted skull that serves as the handle of his cane. A modern day vanitas image, this work suggests the powerful connection between art and life as well as Mapplethorpe's own transitory existence.\nMatthew Drutt\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nNow equally well known as an accomplished filmmaker, Julian Schnabel was catapulted to the status of art world superstar in the early eighties, when his career was synonymous with the revival of painting as a meaningful art form. Using unconventional supports such as velvet, tarpaulin, animal hides, and Kabuki screens, his resolutely gestural work mounted a decisive assault on the prevailing aesthetic hegemonies of Minimalism and Conceptualism, positioning him as the figurehead of the Neo-Expressionist movement. Schnabels plate paintingsinspired by a visit to Gaudis Parc Guell in Barcelona, as well as the proportions of the closet wall in his Spanish hotel roomremain his most iconic works. In The Student of Prague, the artist characteristically draws on the imagery of Christian ritual, layering roughly hewn crucifixes over the bed of broken china vessels, and deploying a structure that recalls traditional triptych altarpieces. Despite these religious overtones and the works flamboyant scale and sense of theatre, there is no suggestion of sublime transportation or spiritual succor. Rather, the topography of jagged fragments, eroding the harmony of the traditional two-dimensional picture plane, offers a troubling vision of a chaotic and shattered world, conjuring a visual corollary to T. S. Eliots modern wasteland of a heap of broken images, where the sun beats/And the dead tree gives no shelter.1Katherine Brinson1.T. S.

    "description": "\nDescription\nBorn in Germany just months before the final European battle of World War II, Anselm Kiefer grew up witnessing the results of modern warfare and the division of his homeland. He also experienced the rebuilding of a fragmented nation and its struggle for renewal. Kiefer devoted himself to investigating the interwoven patterns of German mythology and history and the way they contributed to the rise of Fascism. He confronted these issues by violating aesthetic taboos and resurrecting sublimated icons. For example, in his 1969 Occupations series, Kiefer photographed himself striking the Sieg Heil pose. Subsequent paintingsimmense landscapes and architectural interiors, often encrusted with sand and strawinvoke Germanys literary and political heritage. References abound to the Nibel-ungen and Wagner, Albert Speers architecture, and Adolf Hitler.Seraphim is part of Kiefers Angel series, which treats the theme of spiritual salvation by fire, an ancient belief perverted by the Nazis in their quest for an exclusively Aryan nation. In this painting, a ladder connects a landscape to the sky. At its base, a serpentsymbolizing a fallen angelrefers to the prevalence of evil on earth. According to the Doctrine of Celestial Hierarchy, a 5th-century text, the seraphim purify through fire and burnt offering. Kiefer used fire to create the surface of Seraphim, and it is evident from this and many other works that he associates fire with the redemptive powers of art. This equivalence was suggested in the 1974 canvas Painting = Burning, in which the outline of a painters palette is superimposed on a view of the war-torn earth. The actual burning of materials used in Seraphim suggests a more specific reading: the Latin word used to describe a sacrificial offering consumed by flames is holocaust.In 1991, the year of Germanys reunification, Kiefer left his homeland to travel the world; he eventually settled in the South of France. This change had a marked effect on the artists style and themes, which ranged from the sunflowers of Arles to the queens of France. In a series of works devoted to French female royalty, Kiefer paid homage to the likes of Catherine de Medici, Marie-Antoinette, and Anne dAutriche. In Les Reines de France, the women are rendered like Byzantine icons against a background of distressed gold-leaf mosaic. This new iconography, while still engaged with the weight of history, indicates that Kiefer now approached his subject matter with admiration, even joy.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nRobert Mapplethorpe emerged as an artist in New York in the 1970s amid two simultaneous but disparate events: the rise of the market for photography as a fine art, and the explosion of punk and gay cultures. Originally trained in painting and sculpture, Mapplethorpe gravitated toward photography, first making erotic collages in 1969 to 1970 with images cut from magazines, then creating his own photographs using a Polaroid camera. Within a few years he was exhibiting erotic male and female nudes, still lifes of flowers, and celebrity portraits, all made with a large-format camera. By the late 1970s his work had developed into a style that was classical and stylish. He continued to explore explicit homoerotic themes, and his subject matter made his work a lightning rod for the contentious debates on public funding for the visual arts during the 1980s.\nAlthough he occasionally worked with color, Mapplethorpe remained devoted to the minimal elegance of black-and-white photography, using the medium in part as an agent to explore certain paradoxes and binary relationships. In many of his works, for example, the distinction between male and female is problematized. In his two Self-Portrait photographs of 1980, the artist blurs his gender identity by appearing in one image in partial drag, his face dramatically made-up, and in another as a sneering, smoking greaser archetype.

    "description": "\nDescription\nMartin Puryear raises, then resolves, contrary formal issues in the making of his abstract wooden sculptures, creating a dynamic equilibrium of antithetical forces. In works such as Seer he strives to balance the opposition of a volumetric, closed form with one that is open yet inaccessible. There is also a linear element to this sculpture: the wire is a kind of drawing in space, reminiscent of a Renaissance exercise in perspective, while the wooden circle on the floor outlines a base from which the wire chassis appears to have been extruded. Puryears virtuoso ability to control wood stems from his knowledge of craft traditions. Though originally trained as a painter, in the mid-1960s the artist learned about indigenous carpentry in Africa and began to make wooden sculptures while in Sweden, where he observed Scandinavian woodworking techniques.The clarity of Puryears forms, along with his interest in the physical response of the viewer to his objects, allies the artist to the Minimalist sculptors of the late 1960s. But the Minimalists espousal of industrial materials and fabrication and their denial of metaphor were anathema to Puryear, who is committed to organic materials, handcraftsmanship, and poetic evocation through form. His work is more akin to that of the Post-Minimalists, such as Eva Hesse, whose constructions have organic connotations, even though they are often assembled from man-made elements.The variety of sculptural methods and materials Puryear employshe opposes bent wood with woven wire, for example, and integrates found objects into handmade structuresleads to myriad metaphorical interpretations. Seer evokes associations with architecture; the wire base of the object suggests both a yurt (the temporary home of nomadic Mongols) and the hull of a boat. It also incorporates the idea of a cage. Critics have noted intimations of violence and sexuality and a sense of frustrated energy in Puryears work. Applying such a reading to Seer, one could interpret the lower section of the sculpture as a trap for invisible gases that are metaphorically funneled into the cone in a Duchampian play on sexual energy. The horn atop the cage might be seen as a portent of divinity, adding another layer of meaning. Looked at straight on, it reads as a spire, becoming a divining rod directed toward a celestial mark.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nSally Mann has photographed a range of subjects since the late 1970s, from the people and environs of her hometown in rural Virginia, to desolate Southern plantations and somber Civil War sites. She is best known, however, for a series of intimate portraits of her children, which she began in 1984 and published in 1992 under the title Immediate Family. These lyrical black-and-white photographs, shot with an antique, 8 x 10 inch view camera, record Mann's son and two daughters growing up in the same unchanging landscape in which she was raised. The season is always summer and the children are usually outdoors, wearing little or no clothes. In some photographs, Mann's young subjects assume enigmatic poses in works that recall the staged allegories of the Victorian-era photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, who also worked with children. More typically, they are engaged in everyday, childhood activitiesswimming, dressing up, painting their bodiesor simply gazing assertively back at the camera.Mann's photographs of her children are at once specific and universal. She creates a deeply nostalgic and tender record of Emmett, Jessie, and Virginia, and their unique bodies and personalities, as if to freeze them before they slip out of childhood. At the same time, Mann is interested in viewing her children as part of a much larger cycle. She explains in her elegiac introduction to the series: \"We are spinning a story of what it is to grow up. It is a complicated story and sometimes we try to take on the grand themesanger, love, death, sensuality, and beauty.\" Mann does not shy away from the darker or more taboo aspects of childhood. In a number of works, she acknowledges the sexuality that is already present in childhood by capturing her children's naked bodies in poses that imply adult knowledge. In The Modest Child (1990), for instance, her five-year-old daughter covers her chest as if to suggest shame for breasts that have not yet developed. Other photographs fast-forward further in time, even hinting at the child's mortality. In the ambiguous and haunting Fallen Child (1989), Mann's daughter lies facedown on the ground, her eyes closed and her body bathed in a radiant, ethereal light. With grass scattered all over her still body, she appears to belong to the earth.Ted Mann\r\n        ",

In many of his works, for example, the distinction between male and female is problematized. In his two Self Portrait photographs of 1980, the artist blurs his gender identity by appearing in one image in partial drag, his face dramatically made-up, and in another as a sneering, smoking greaser archetype. Juxtaposing conventional signs for man and womanphysical, cosmetic, and sartorialMapplethorpe questions established notions of \"male\" and \"female,\" revealing their status as socially constructed terms. In a similar fashion, Mapplethorpe's 1985 Self Portrait collapses other supposed dualisms by picturing himself with hornsa sign pointing to the concepts of good and evil central to both Christian and Greek mythology and embodied by figures such as Satan, the Bible's fallen angel, and Dionysus, a Greek god associated with hedonism and sexual desire. In other works Mapplethorpe juxtaposes black nudes with emphatically white objectsa shroud, marble statuary, flowers, or, in the case of Ken Moody and Robert Sherman (1984), another male.\nIn photographs of nude models and sculptural objects such as Apollo (1988) and Italian Devil (1988), Mapplethorpe both literally and formally drew on classical sculpture. The blending of sculpture and photography in his work represents both a classical search for perfectiona word Mapplethorpe used frequentlyand an attempt to collapse the two mediums into a single practice. He once claimed, \"If I had been born one or two hundred years ago, I might have been a sculptor, but photography is a very quick way to see, to make sculpture.\"1\nIn his haunting Self Portrait of 1988, Mapplethorpe blended sculpture with his own image. Unlike earlier self-portraits in which he assumed various personae such as rocker, leather fetishist, cross-dresser, and fashion plate, this photograph, taken about a year before his death due to complications of AIDS, has a more somber mood. The artist's gaunt face peers out from a black background and appears to be floating in space. The seemingly disembodied head simultaneously suggests his physical deterioration and formally echoes the sculpted skull that serves as the handle of his cane. A modern day vanitas image, this work suggests the powerful connection between art and life as well as Mapplethorpe's own transitory existence.\nMatthew Drutt\n1.

As a dramatic finale to the performance, the motorized sculpture Knife Ship I, a giant Swiss Army pocketknife set afloat like a colossal Venetian gondola, was launched from the Arsenale naval yard, its blade and corkscrew sails cleaving the air. Like many of their monuments to banal everyday items, Oldenburg and Van Bruggen's Knife Ship I, in its absurdity, challenges viewers' ordinary relationship to objects and the environment.\n",

Immersed in the prevailing currents of critical theory, these artists used appropriation to interrogate the assumptions surrounding visual representation. Whereas many of her contemporaries drew images from everyday life and the mass media, Levine found a more rarified source in the annals of 20th-century art, appropriating verbatim from the oeuvres of such modernist luminaries as Walker Evans, Willem de Kooning, Fernand Leger, Piet Mondrian, and Edward Weston. After Rodchenko: 112 (1987/98) comprises 12 rephotographed facsimiles of the work of the Russian Constructivist, whose boldly dynamic photographs dating from the 1920s and 1930s reflect a fiercely communist ideology. Feminist critics have interpreted the performative nature of Levines work, in which she assumes the identity of an artistic predecessor, as a subversive intervention in the rigid (and overwhelmingly male) construction of the art-historical canon. However, while she acknowledges this oedipal aspect of her practice, she ultimately prefers to view her work as a regenerative act of collaboration, transforming the singular masterpiece into something fluid and perpetually renewable.In tandem to her iconoclastic rephotography works, Levine has enacted more allusive transformations of her artistic sources. In the Knot Paintings, begun in 1985, she painted in the whorls formed by the grain of untreated plywood boards. Along with a contemporaneous series based on the geometric patterns of chessboards and checkerboards, these works represent a new type of conceptual gesture for the artist. Dictated by the existing, arbitrary forms of a found object, their titles pun on the fact that they are not paintings in the traditional sense, and the isolated ellipses of monochromatic pigment draw careful attention to their medium. Reducing her composition to a bare industrial support and uninflected, repeated units of color, Levine seems to engage with the strategies of Minimalist abstractionevoking both the monochromatic planes of the painting associated with the movement and the plywood sculptures of Donald Judd. Characteristically, her dialogue with the visual tradition is infused with ambiguity, and the tensions deriving from what she has termed as a head-on confrontation with the anxiety of influence result in an act of homage as much as of hostile usurpation.Katherine Brinson\n",

More recently his Perpetual Photo series (198289) investigates the idea of the simulacra, a copy several degrees removed from the source, whose own existence is questionable. The artist photographs television stills and further abstracts his shots through cropping and enlargement to the point that the original image is impossible to locate. His manipulated picture frustrates the viewers gaze; and its pretense of representing something draws the eye into a cul-de-sac of seeing, yet continually defers recognition. One sees only an extracted image in a sepia-toned print, an abstract form meant to capture the essential nature of photography. Through a series of copies, McCollum has drawn out a tense, unstable original.Helen Hsu\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe 1960s and 1970s witnessed what has been termed the dematerialization of the art object. The prevailing movements of the period favored austere expression; works with an economy of means often focused on the idea or concept rather than the object itself. By contrast, the 1980s were characterized by a return to the traditions of painting and sculpture. Amid this celebration of conservative values, Julian Schnabel played a critical role in the emergence of Neo-Expressionist painting in the U.S. After two decades dominated by the aesthetics of Minimalist and Conceptual art, Schnabel's heroic scale, gestural brushstrokes, and figurative subject matter marked a radical shift in painting.Schnabel came to prominence with his signature plate paintings, such as Spain. The surface of this monumental work is strewn with shards of broken crockery and covered with thick layers of pigment. The series, notable for its heroic scale, flamboyant texture, and distorted subjects, was conceived in the 1970s after Schnabel visited Barcelona, where he saw mosaic benches by Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi. Transforming the traditional surface of the mosaic, the broken plates and cups project from the canvas like jagged, sculptural brushstrokes. The swirling colors of this series often depict legendary figures, and the disembodied head in the center of Spain is an important and recurrent image in the artist's work. Some such figures recall the work of Picasso, but the artist draws from many sources, including El Greco and cultural artifacts from Mexico. The earthy tones of red and ocher and the elongated black shadows that stretch across the canvas clearly evoke the Spanish landscape.In 1987 Schnabel began making paintings in which written words and proper names serve as subject matter. The early works in this series marked a change in imagery from one of excess to one of deliberate austerity and from pictorial narrative to oblique, linguistic reference. In this series, Fakires signals a return to a richer palette and a more layered and expressionistic surface than in his earlier word paintings.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nCindy Shermans Untitled Film Stills (197780) have been canonized as a hallmark of postmodernist art, which frequently utilized mass-media codes and techniques of representation in order to comment on contemporary society. In this series of 69 black-and-white photographs, Sherman posed herself in various melodramatic guises that recall the stereotypical feminine characters presented in 8 x 10 publicity stills for B-grade movies from the 1950s and 1960s. The personae she created range from ingenue lost in the big city to martini-wielding party girl to jilted lover to hausfrau. Untitled Film Still, #15 (1978) depicts the tough girl with a heart of gold. Contrary to the media images they appropriate, which may require a transparent sense of realism to sell an illusion, Shermans stills have an artifice that is heightened by the often visible camera cord, slightly eccentric props, unusual camera angles, and by the fact that each image includes the artist, rather than a recognizable actress or model.In the early 1980s Sherman continued to explore stereotypes of femininity and female representation found in popular culture, such as the centerfold format of pornographic magazines. She also began to use color in her work; her painterly sensibility is apparent in Untitled, #112 (1982) and subsequent photographs. Untitled, #112 is also one of the first images in which the artist portrays a more masculine identity. This gender ambiguity, along with the way the unusually lit figure emerges from the black background, yields an unsettling sensation. These effects become ominous and even frightening in later works in which Sherman portrays more disheveled and malign characters.Untitled, #167 (1986) is from Shermans Disasters series, which directly investigates grotesque and disgusting subject matter. The sense of foreboding elicited by earlier works is more overt, suggesting the terror of horror films (a genre that significantly focuses on female victims). Untitled, #167 depicts the scene of a gruesome crime. Emerging from the dirt are the nose, lips, and red-painted fingertips of a blonde, apparently female, victim. A discarded Polaroid photographic sheath suggests documentation (either by a police officer or perhaps the villain, whose reflection appears in an open makeup compact), and obliquely implicates the artist as photographic voyeur. The very darkness of the image and the reflectiveness of the photographs surface make it difficult for the viewer to scrutinize the scene. Untitled, #167 foreshadows Shermans use of prosthetic body parts in her later works, as well as the gradual elimination of her own likeness.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

Typically, Steinbach chose banal objects from everyday life and arranged them on plastic-laminated triangular-wedge shelving units. The interior angles of the triangular units are constant90, 50, and 40 degreesand they always relate to the objects on top through volume and color. Steinbach has proposed parallels between the structure of his works and game boards, the sequence of pitches in musical scales, and the arrangement of goods on department-store shelves.Ultra red #2, a typical Steinbach shelf sculpture, features four ruby-golden lava lamps, nine russet cooking pots, and six digital alarm clocks with blinking scarlet readouts. Just as the lava lamps and clocks continuously mutate, so too ultra red #2 resists any fixed meaning. A fundamental issue it raises is one of language. The title, perhaps citing the names given to paint colors, focuses attention on an element that is common to the objects and the shelvesthey are all some shade of red. Steinbachs approach to red is similar to that of the linguist remarking on the many words for snow used by the Eskimos. It is an anthropological perspective. Steinbach is fascinated by the way physical reality invariably shapes local linguistic or cultural customs. Because red exists as an idea above and beyond its infinite physical variations, we can refer to the cooking pots and lava lamps as red, and thereby find a link between them.Steinbachs work has often been understood in terms of its implied commentary on consumer culture and on the hidden aesthetic in consumer products. Ultra red #2 bears this out with its reference to design from the 1960s through the 1980s. But this accounts for only one aspect of the work. Steinbach highlights the contiguous illogic of the placement of objects in the world, arranging the elements of his sculptures to reflect their original accidental juxtapositions. He has also explored other kinds of juxtapositions, using objects as metaphors for race, age, and culture.By using items that are readily available and easily replaceable, Steinbach tried to undermine the fetishization of the art object. This monumental triptych made of household wares suggests that the artistic stacking of forms is as relative a construction as the development of different dialects.Cornelia Lauf\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1977, James Turrell purchased a parcel of land in north-central Arizona near the Painted Desert and the Grand Canyon. The centerpiece of this land is a 600-foot-tall dormant volcanic cinder cone, the location of Turrells Roden Crater Project (1979 ). The artist first discovered the site while doing an aerial survey in 1974, after seven months of searching for an appropriate location for his planned naked-eye observatory. Still under construction, the observatory will eventually comprise a network of pathways, tunnels, and mostly subterranean spaces with apertures designed to enable the viewing of atmospheric phenomena. Inspired by ancient architecture such as Mayan pyramids and by his own Quaker upbringing, Turrell aims to create a spiritual, contemplative environment in which the wonder of the natural world is isolated and amplified. Roden Craters volcanic formation preserves evidence of a terrestrial event, representing for the artist the passing of geologic time. By opening the crater up to the sky, the observatory will marry the geologic and the astronomical.\nTurrell has made numerous drawings, photographs, prints, and models of the site over the past four decades. Crater Site Plan with Survey Net (1986) is among a group of drawings he created in 1985 and 1986 that map out the locations of aboveground walkways and underground tunnels. This two-part work shows an aerial view of Roden Crater, paired with an elevation view of the planned subterranean spaces. Turrell created the work by transferring photographic images onto Mylar sheets using wax emulsion. He then applied markings to the image by removing the wax or drawing over it with ink, paint, and wax crayon. The two sheets are framed separately and hung to abut one another. The aerial source image, taken by the artist, honors the extension of human vision through flightaeronautics is a passion of the artistswhile the instrument of the architectural plan refers to the logic of human perception. In this way vision and perception, both essential to the wonder of the Roden Crater Project, are also present in their particulars in this drawing.\nDiana Kamin\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAndy Warhol announced his disengagement from the process of aesthetic creation in 1963: I think somebody should be able to do all my paintings for me, he told art critic G.R. Swenson. The Abstract Expressionists had seen the artist as a heroic figure, alone capable of imparting his poetic vision of the world through gestural abstraction. Warhol, like other Pop artists, used found printed images from newspapers, publicity stills, and advertisements as his subject matter; he adopted silkscreening, a technique of mass reproduction, as his medium. And unlike the Abstract Expressionists, who searched for a spiritual pinnacle in their art, Warhol aligned himself with the signs of contemporary mass culture. His embrace of subjects traditionally considered debasedfrom celebrity worship to food labelshas been interpreted as both an exuberant affirmation of American culture and a thoughtless espousal of the low. The artists perpetual examination of themes of death and disaster suggest yet another dimension to his art.Warhol was preoccupied with news reports of violent deathsuicides, car crashes, assassinations, and executions. In the early 1960s he began to make paintings, such as Orange Disaster #5, with the serial application of images revolving around the theme of death. When you see a gruesome picture over and over again, he commented, it doesnt really have any effect. Yet Orange Disaster #5, with its electric chair repeated 15 times, belies this statement. Warhols painting speaks to the constant reiteration of tragedy in the media, and becomes, perhaps, an attempt to exorcise this image of death through repetition. However, it also emphasizes the pathos of the empty chair waiting for its next victim, the jarring orange only accentuating the horror of the isolated seat in a room with a sign blaring SILENCE.Warhols death and disaster pictures underscore the importance of the vanitas themethat death will take us allin his oeuvre. Self-Portrait, one of the last self-portraits Warhol painted before his death, may be considered the anxious meditation of an aging artist. (Other works he painted in his final year include a posthumous portrait of Joseph Beuys, who died in 1986, and a rendition of Leonardo da Vincis Last Supper.) The monumental scale of Self-Portrait suggests that Warhols obsession with celebrity encompassed himself. Yet unlike nearly all of his portraits, which commonly include the sitters neck and shoulders, this otherworldly image presents the artist as spectral, his acid green, disembodied head like a skull looming out of the black background.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nTwo Cells with Conduit resembles the Hard-edge paintings of Ellsworth Kelly, Brice Marden, and Kenneth Noland, but while the work of those artists may be described as abstract, Peter Halley prefers the designation diagrammatic for his precise, austere arrangements. He conceives of his vocabulary of squares, bars, and rectangles as coded referents to the way in which geometry pervades our world. Life in late-capitalist culture, according to Halleys own critical writing, has been inscribed and circumscribed by geometric networks: think of the urban grid, the office tower, the high-rise apartment building, the correctional institution, the parking lot. Halleys morphological investigations also focus on the traditional manner in which geometric abstraction has been perceived. By invoking the formal attributes of Minimalist artrigid planes of color, unitary shapes, and nonhierarchical compositionsand mapping a narrative sensibility onto them, Halley calls the supposed neutrality of such art into question.As both author and artist, Halley has drawn upon the writings of the French theoreticians Michel Foucault and Jean Baudrillard to articulate and substantiate his dual critique of culture and art. Foucaults analysis of the geometric organization of industrial society, particularly institutional modes of confinement, inspired Halley to transform a Minimalist square into a prison cell by adding three vertical bars to the form. In response to Baudrillards exploration of postindustrial cultureits reliance on information systems, media representation, and an economy that privileges image over productHalley shifted to schematized depictions of enclosed spaces, linked to the world through a network of electronic, telephonic, and fiber-optic conduits. The division of Two Cells with Conduit into two discrete portions suggests an architectural section; the squares above represent prototypical urban dwellings while the line below indicates the hidden, technological underworld of pipes, cables, and wires connecting them. Begun in 1981, the cell-and-conduit paintings demonstrate what Halley has described as the seductive geometry of 1980s culture, epitomized by the irreal space of the video game. The Day-Glo colors and ersatz stucco paintknown as Roll-a-Texmake these canvases into emblems of a social reality, in which artifice replaces empirical experience.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThough born and raised in Greece, Jannis Kounellis reached artistic maturity in Italy. He immersed himself in his adopted homelands rich aesthetic history, and came to trust that arts importance lies in its reflection of the complex web of beliefs and values at the heart of cultural development. Throughout history, Kounellis concluded, art evolved in response to and in expression of fundamental theological, intellectual, and political thought patterns. But he determined that postwar European society lacked appropriate aesthetic forms through which to reflect the fragmentary nature of contemporary civilization. Conventional painting and sculpture, as products of cultural unity, were no longer germane to the erratic situation he perceived. In 1967 he began producing sculptures, installations, and theatrical performances that intentionally embraced the fragmentary and the ephemeral. At that time, he was associated with a number of Italian artists who, for similar political and aesthetic reasons, were pursuing an analogous goal. Grouped together under the name Arte Povera, their work incorporated organic and industrial materials resulting in poetic confrontations between nature, culture, and the fabricated environment. To this end, Kounellis has blocked doorways and windows with accumulations of stones or wood fragments. He even went as far as to include live animals in his work in the attempt to formulate an entirely new paradigm through which to experience art. He also utilized fire in the form of butane torches and smoke residue to evoke the alchemical, transformative potential of the flame, while simultaneously referring to its destructive force.By the end of the 1960s Kounelliss repertoire of materials included rock, wood, burlap, wool, steel, lead, gold, fire, and fragments of classical sculpture, which he has since employed in numerous combinations to formulate a body of work that is iconographically consistent yet stylistically variable. The metal wall reliefs, such as this work, are morphologically reminiscent of painting but conceptually distant. The fusion of organic and inorganic substanceshere, a circle of golden wax embedded into a sheet of leadsymbolizes the shifting and unpredictable nature of meaning in art. Such a juxtaposition of contradictory materials serves perhaps as an allegory for human fragility and the inevitability of historical imperatives.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nRobert Mapplethorpe arrived in New York in the 1970s amid two simultaneous but disparate events: the rise of the market for photography as a fine art, and the explosion of punk and gay cultures. Originally trained in painting and sculpture, Mapplethorpe gravitated toward photography, first making erotic collages in 196970 with images cut from magazines, then creating his own images using a Polaroid camera. Within a few years he was exhibiting erotic male and female nudes, still lifes of flowers, and celebrity portraits, all made with a large-format camera. By the late 1970s his work had developed into a style that was at once classical and stylish yet retained the explicit homoerotic themes for which the artist is perhaps best known. Mapplethorpes subject matter made his work a lightning rod for the contentious debates on public funding for the visual arts during the 1980s that would ultimately decimate the federal governments support for artists. However, this legacy of controversy tends to overshadow Mapplethorpes aesthetic impact.Although he occasionally worked with color, Mapplethorpe remained devoted to the minimal elegance of black-and-white photography, using the medium in part as an agent to explore certain paradoxes and binary relationships. In many of his works, for example, the distinction between male and female is problematized: in Ken and Tyler the male assumes the more traditionally femininized role of the nude, while Calla Lily takes an object used as a cipher of femininity and redeploys it as a male organ. The black male nude is often juxtaposed with an emphatically white objecta shroud, marble statuary, flowers, or, in the case of Ken and Tyler, another nude male.Mapplethorpes sustained investigation of black-and-white photography may seem nostalgic next to the preference for color demonstrated by most artists working with photography in the 1980s. But his restricted palette, which recalls that of the modern masters whose work he emulated (especially George Platt Lynes), proved most effective at conveying the poetic and often melancholic quality of his subjects. At the height of his career, Mapplethorpe was stricken with AIDS. In contrast to earlier self-portraits in which Mapplethorpe assumed various personae such as rocker, leather fetishist, cross-dresser, fashion plate, and so on, Self-Portrait, taken about a year before his death, has a more somber mood. The photograph serves as a haunting document of the artists transitory existence.Matthew Drutt\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe oft-proclaimed return to the body in artistic practice and critical discourse in the late 1980s was partly a response to the high rationality of Minimalism and Conceptual art, in which references to the human form were at most oblique, as well as to the theoretical feminist prohibition of representations of the female body, which was deigned hopelessly subject to patriarchal desire. The work of contemporary artists such as Robert Gober, Charles Ray, Cindy Sherman, and Kiki Smith concentrates on the body, fragmented and whole, depicted relatively realistically yet always suggestively altered. These artists are concerned with the connections and disruptions between private sensations of corporeality and socially constructed public identities, and the human form as a vessel for the expression of affect, rather than with traditional figurative representation.In 1979 Smith turned to Grays Anatomy as a source for drawings that depict aspects of the human body in cross-section and on a microscopic level. A few years later she produced sculptures of body parts and internal organs made of paper, plaster, resin, and various metals. Representations of human circulatory and nervous systems, among others, followed. In her transition from exploring the bodys interior to its exterior, Smith began to investigate the skin as a system and subsequently to create visceral, life-size figures (usually female). Smiths limbs, heads, organs, and flayed bodies might suggest the tools of medical education, except for the evocative materials from which they are made and the tender, homemade quality of their production. Like earlier feminist artists, she pointedly rehabilitates mediums and processes, such as clay and paper, glassmaking and embroidery, that were previously disdained as craft techniques unsuitable for high art.Smiths delicate sculpture Ribs represents in terra-cotta the components of a rib cage, strung together and held up like a marionette suspended from the wall. The pink rib bones, disconnected from the sternum, some revealing repaired breaks, imply forensic evidence of trauma. The apparent fragility of Smiths piece evokes the transience of life itself. Ribs registers the passage of time both in the way that the unique rendering of the bones suggests that they might have belonged to a specific individual, and the manner in which its display evokes the natural-history museum and its fascination with the organic specimen as a link to a collective past.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nUnlike pictorial art that replicates visual experience through mimetic illusion, James Turrells light worksone cannot call these shimmering events objects or even imagesgive form to perception. Through sophisticated yet spare arrangements of natural light, artificial light, and built environments, his installations encourage a heightened sensory awareness and a state of self-reflexiveness in which viewers can see themselves seeing, as the artist puts it.\nIn 1987 Turrell designed Night Passage, a work in the Danae group of his ongoing Space Division Constructions. These installations feature a bifurcated room; visitors peer into what the artist calls a sensing space through a large opening in the partition wall. This aperture bears a knife-sharp edge, and the light fixtures that flank it create blushes of electrical light in the viewing space. Turrell has compared the effect of these lights on the viewer to that of standing on a theatrical stage: under spotlights the audience disappears into an inky void, but outside the light a performer can see again. In the Space Division Constructions, this state of partial blindness contributes to the impression that the opening is actually a solid plane of color on the wall. In Night Passage, the volume of colored light on the other side of the threshold of the partition collapses into what appears to be a floating, luminous plane with no surface or depth, only a deep, unchanging blue hue. The illusion is destabilizing yet mesmerizing; it is a tangible example of the artists endeavor to produce sensations that are essentially prelingual, to create a transformative experience of wordless thought.\nNat Trotman and Nancy Spector\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nLyle Ashton Harris began employing self-portraiture in his practice in the 1980s as a way to further explore dissonance and identity beyond his well-known oeuvre of portrait work. Ecstasy #2 (1987) and Americas (198788), photographs from Harriss White Face series (198788) are palimpsests, black-and-white images inscribed with multilayered ruminations on and subversions of ethnicity, gender, and sexual desire. Ecstasy #2 follows Ecstasy #1 (198788); both self-portraits depict Harriss wide-open mouth, naked torso, tensed limbs while he wears whiteface, deliberately manipulating the viewers ability to definitively pinpoint the gender and ethnic identity displayed. As curator Okuwi Enwezor highlights in his assessment of Harriss work, whiteface originated in the 19th century through vaudeville and minstrelsy where it portrayed an American racial archetype [that] reflected the racial and sexual anxieties that often accompanied the public discourse of race.1 The photographs also invoke the notion of passing, an act, often carried out under duress, of forsaking ones ethnicity to assimilate into a more socially acceptable group.\nThroughout his work, and especially in this early series, Harris uses his own body to probe collective ideas about black and queer identities, rather than individual autobiography. For Harris, portraiture is a strategy of question, declaration, and provocation as well as a practice that symbolically extends the life of the subjects posed in front of the camera and calls attention to the fiction of the constructed image, and constructed selfhood. In Americas, a precursor to the bodies captured by Paris Is Burning (1990), Jennie Livingstons documentary on New Yorks mid-to-late-1990s drag balls, Harris performs in front of his camera, thrusting and retreating simultaneously. His peroxide-blonde wig and heavy makeup both elide and exaggerate his features, using the space of the photograph as a site of shifting indexical value. The triptych depicts a series of nudes: Harris alone in one image; alongside Kym in a second image; and absent in the third, giving the frame over to Miss America, a black female nude draped in the stars and stripes and also in whiteface. The relationship between the figures as well as the one between the subjects and the viewer are ambiguous. Harriss and Kyms eyes look forward, quixotically engaging the viewer and invoking the slippery dynamics of the gaze as a means with which to inscribe identity; Miss America is captured in motion, perhaps straining away from that same gaze.\nMichelle Jubin\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nBetween 1972 and 1974, Nan Goldin shot black-and-white photographs of her friends at The Other Side, a drag bar in Boston, in her words to pay homage to those whose third gender . . . made more sense than either of the other two. Ivy with Marilyn, Boston, from this body of work, presages her subsequent groundbreaking color images in content and style. In this portrait of a person with whom the artist is personally involved, made on the scene, rather than in a studio, Ivy, a pre-op transsexual, embodies the gender ambiguity that Goldin found so liberating. Goldin frequently portrays her subjects, which include herself, in their homes or socializing in clubs and bars. Elements of the decorsuch as masks or in this photograph, the Andy Warhol poster of Marilyn Monroeoften echo the belief in identity as a performance of a personal ideal, one that may be at odds with mainstream conceptions of gender.After finishing art school in 1978, Goldin moved to New York, where she continued to photograph her friendsartists and performers, denizens of the burgeoning East Village underground. By this time she was using color film and assembling her vast archive of slides into an ever-expanding show accompanied by an evocative music track, which she presented in clubs in the early 1980s. In her influential book, The Ballad of Sexual Dependency (1986), she focused on relationships and daringly portrayed her and her friends' passionate encounters. The Ballad, which includes portraits of individuals, images of separate and mixed-gender groups, and shots of coupling, partying, and violent acting out, suggests a passage from euphoria to dysphoria and back in an endless cycle of pleasure and pain. In Trixie on the cot, NYC, the artifice of her outfitthrift-shop party dress, heavy make-up, and doll-like hair ribbonsevokes an exaggerated femininity, a self-presentation that dovetailed with a growing mainstream questioning of gender. Greer and Robert on the bed, NYC, also from the book, hints at an inevitable discord between a heterosexual couple, but as in most of Goldin's work, their gender is mutable and fluid.Goldin's timely subject matter subsequently serves as a loving memorial to a community ravaged by drug addiction and AIDS. Formally, her deft use of lush color, as well as her large-scale (76.2 x 101.6 cm) Cibachrome prints, made Goldin both a leader in the phenomenal expansion of color photography into contemporary art in the 1980s as well as an inspiration for other artists through the 1990s.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nSally Mann has photographed a range of subjects since the late 1970s, from the people and environs of her hometown in rural Virginia, to desolate Southern plantations and somber Civil War sites. She is best known, however, for a series of intimate portraits of her children, which she began in 1984 and published in 1992 under the title Immediate Family. These lyrical black-and-white photographs, shot with an antique, 8 x 10 inch view camera, record Mann's son and two daughters growing up in the same unchanging landscape in which she was raised. The season is always summer and the children are usually outdoors, wearing little or no clothes. In some photographs, Mann's young subjects assume enigmatic poses in works that recall the staged allegories of the Victorian-era photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, who also worked with children. More typically, they are engaged in everyday, childhood activitiesswimming, dressing up, painting their bodiesor simply gazing assertively back at the camera.Mann's photographs of her children are at once specific and universal. She creates a deeply nostalgic and tender record of Emmett, Jessie, and Virginia, and their unique bodies and personalities, as if to freeze them before they slip out of childhood. At the same time, Mann is interested in viewing her children as part of a much larger cycle. She explains in her elegiac introduction to the series: \"We are spinning a story of what it is to grow up. It is a complicated story and sometimes we try to take on the grand themesanger, love, death, sensuality, and beauty.\" Mann does not shy away from the darker or more taboo aspects of childhood. In a number of works, she acknowledges the sexuality that is already present in childhood by capturing her children's naked bodies in poses that imply adult knowledge. In The Modest Child (1990), for instance, her five-year-old daughter covers her chest as if to suggest shame for breasts that have not yet developed. Other photographs fast-forward further in time, even hinting at the child's mortality. In the ambiguous and haunting Fallen Child (1989), Mann's daughter lies facedown on the ground, her eyes closed and her body bathed in a radiant, ethereal light. With grass scattered all over her still body, she appears to belong to the earth.Ted Mann\r\n        ",

Originally trained in painting and sculpture, Mapplethorpe gravitated toward photography, first making erotic collages in 1969 to 1970 with images cut from magazines, then creating his own photographs using a Polaroid camera. Within a few years he was exhibiting erotic male and female nudes, still lifes of flowers, and celebrity portraits, all made with a large-format camera. By the late 1970s his work had developed into a style that was classical and stylish. He continued to explore explicit homoerotic themes, and his subject matter made his work a lightning rod for the contentious debates on public funding for the visual arts during the 1980s.\nAlthough he occasionally worked with color, Mapplethorpe remained devoted to the minimal elegance of black-and-white photography, using the medium in part as an agent to explore certain paradoxes and binary relationships. In many of his works, for example, the distinction between male and female is problematized. In his two Self-Portrait photographs of 1980, the artist blurs his gender identity by appearing in one image in partial drag, his face dramatically made-up, and in another as a sneering, smoking greaser archetype. Juxtaposing conventional signs for man and womanphysical, cosmetic, and sartorialMapplethorpe questions established notions of \"male\" and \"female,\" revealing their status as socially constructed terms. In a similar fashion, Mapplethorpe's 1985 Self-Portrait collapses other supposed dualisms by picturing himself with hornsa sign pointing to the concepts of good and evil central to both Christian and Greek mythology and embodied by figures such as Satan, the Bible's fallen angel, and Dionysus, a Greek god associated with hedonism and sexual desire. In other works Mapplethorpe juxtaposes black nudes with emphatically white objectsa shroud, marble statuary, flowers, or, in the case of Ken Moody and Robert Sherman (1984), another male.\nIn photographs of nude models and sculptural objects such as Apollo (1988) and Italian Devil (1988), Mapplethorpe both literally and formally drew on classical sculpture. The blending of sculpture and photography in his work represents both a classical search for perfectiona word Mapplethorpe used frequentlyand an attempt to collapse the two mediums into a single practice. He once claimed, \"If I had been born one or two hundred years ago, I might have been a sculptor, but photography is a very quick way to see, to make sculpture.\"1\nIn his haunting Self-Portrait of 1988, Mapplethorpe blended sculpture with his own image. Unlike earlier self-portraits in which he assumed various personae such as rocker, leather fetishist, cross-dresser, and fashion plate, this photograph, taken about a year before his death due to complications of AIDS, has a more somber mood. The artist's gaunt face peers out from a black background and appears to be floating in space.

    "description": "\nDescription\nDuring the late 1960s and the 1970s Faith Ringgold played an instrumental role in the organization of protests and actions against museums that had neglected the work of women and people of color. Her paintings from this period are overtly political, and present an angry, critical reappraisal of the American dream glimpsed through the filter of race and gender relations. Ringgolds more recent aesthetic strategy, however, is not one of political agitation or blatant visual provocation. Instead, she has come to embrace the potential for social change by undermining racial and gender stereotypes through impassioned and optimistic presentations of black female heroines.Ringgolds vehicle is the story quilta traditional American craft associated with womens communal work that also has roots in African culture. She originally collaborated on the quilt motif with her mother, a dressmaker and fashion designer in Harlem. That Ringgolds great-great-great-grandmother was a Southern slave who made quilts for plantation owners suggests a further, perhaps deeper, connection between her art and her family history. One of Ringgolds early efforts, dating from 1982, tells the tale of the stereotyped Aunt Jemima through painted images, sewn fabric, and handwritten texts. The naive, folk-art quality of the quilts is part of Ringgolds scheme to emphasize narrative over style, to convey information rather than to dazzle with elaborate technique.Tar Beach, the first quilt in Ringgolds colorful and lighthearted series entitled Women on a Bridge, depicts the fantasies of its spirited heroine and narrator Cassie Louise Lightfoot, who, on a summer night in Harlem, flies over the George Washington Bridge. Sleeping on Tar Beach was magical . . . explains Cassie in the text on the quilt, only eight years old and in the third grade and I can fly. That means I am free to go wherever I want to for the rest of my life. For Ringgold, this phantasmic flight through the urban night sky symbolizes the potential for freedom and self-possession. My women, proclaimed Ringgold about the Women on a Bridge series, are actually flying; they are just free, totally. They take their liberation by confronting this huge masculine iconthe bridge.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

Beginning with a little knowledge goes a long way and ending with your oldest fears are the worst ones, the Truisms employ a variety of voices and express a wide spectrum of biases and beliefs. If any consistent viewpoint emerges in the edgy, stream-of-consciousness provocations it is that truth is relative and that each viewer must become an active participant in determining what is legitimate and what is not. Since the Truisms, Holzer has used language exclusively and has employed myriad ways to convey her messages. Selections from her Inflammatory Essays series, for example, appeared on unsigned, commercially printed posters, which were wheat-pasted on buildings and walls around Manhattan.\nWhen such Holzer phrases as abuse of power comes as no surprise and money creates taste flashed from the Spectacolor board above Times Square in 1982, it marked her first appropriation of electronic signage. In doing so, she brought her disquieting messages to a new height of subversive social engagement. Her strategy-placing surprising texts where normal signage is expected-gives Holzer direct access to a large public that might not give art any consideration, while allowing her to undermine forms of power and control that often go unnoticed.\nIn Holzer's 1989 retrospective installation at the Guggenheim Museum, blinking messages from her various series, programmed to an insistent but silent beat, raced the length of an L.E.D. display board installed along the winding inner wall of Frank Lloyd Wright's spiral ramp. The museum's rotunda was transformed into a dazzling electronic arcade. In bringing her art from the street to the museum, Holzer focused on an audience that differed markedly from the unsuspecting passerby. The Guggenheim visitors who stood beneath the revolving ribbons of red, green, and yellow texts were more likely to be aware that this installation brought up such issues as the viability of public art, the commodification and consumption of art, and the conflation of the personal and the politicalin short, some of the pressing issues of American art in the 1980s.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nBorn in Germany just months before the final European battle of World War II, Anselm Kiefer grew up witnessing the results of modern warfare and the division of his homeland. He also experienced the rebuilding of a fragmented nation and its struggle for renewal. Kiefer devoted himself to investigating the interwoven patterns of German mythology and history and the way they contributed to the rise of Fascism. He confronted these issues by violating aesthetic taboos and resurrecting sublimated icons. For example, in his 1969 Occupations series, Kiefer photographed himself striking the Sieg Heil pose. Subsequent paintingsimmense landscapes and architectural interiorsinvoke Germany's literary and political heritage. References abound to the Nibelungen and Wagner, Albert Speer's architecture, and Adolf Hitler.Seraphim is part of Kiefer's Angel series, which treats the theme of spiritual salvation by fire, an ancient belief perverted by the Nazis in their quest for an exclusively Aryan nation. In this painting, a ladder connects a landscape to the sky. At its base, a serpentsymbolizing a fallen angelrefers to the prevalence of evil on earth. According to the Doctrine of Celestial Hierarchy, a fifth-century text, the seraphim purify through fire and burnt offering. Kiefer used fire to create the surface of Seraphim, and it is evident from this and many other works that he associates fire with the redemptive powers of art. The actual burning of materials used in Seraphim suggests a more specific reading: the Latin word used to describe a sacrificial offering consumed by flames is holocaust.Berenice, constructed from lead, glass, photographs, and human hair, is a reference to a legend dating from the third century B.C. To ensure the safe return of her husband, the Princess of Cyrene (now Libya) sacrificed a lock of her hair, which ascended to the night sky, where it formed a new constellation. The main triangular shape of Berenice represents the wing of an airplane, while the lead tube resting on the ground is the fuselage. Kiefer made a series of airplanes in lead, an ironic material for aircraft. The bitterness and pain left by World War II is represented by the lead, which is a dark, poisonous metal, related to Saturn, the planet that receives the least light. The human hair spills from the fuselage like spent fuel or toxic black fumes and functions as a disturbing reminder of the shorn locks of concentration camp prisoners. Acknowledging a saturation of technology and threats of military force, Kiefer's melancholy sculpture questions where humanity fits into this scheme.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMario Merz envisions the contemporary artist as a nomad, shifting from one environment to another and resisting stylistic uniformity while mediating between nature and culture. Since 1968 Merz has used the hemispherical form of the iglooa transitory dwellingto express his faith in the liberating powers of restlessness with the world and its values. He assembles the rounded structures with segmented, metal armatures, usually covering them with a net and bits of clay, wax, mud, burlap, or leather, glass fragments, or bundles of twigs. Phrases making political or literary references, spelled out in neon, often span the domes. The earliest such example, Giap Igloo (1968), bears a slogan attributed to the North Vietnamese military strategist General Vo Nguyen Giap: If the enemy masses his forces, he loses ground; if he scatters, he loses strength. The contradiction inherent in this phrase captures Merzs conception of the igloo as a momentary shelter that, despite its perpetual relocation, remains a constant.Merz often uses materials indigenous to the sites of his exhibitions to reinforce the nomadic essence of the igloo and its references to a humble economic system close to nature. For a 1979 show in Australia, for instance, he used eucalyptus leaves to blanket an igloo. He also adjusts the structures scale and intricacy of designmore recent examples have been pierced by curving tables, surrounded by stacks of newspapers, or clustered in groupsto correspond to the environment in which they are exhibited. Unreal City, created for the Guggenheim Museums spiraling rotunda on the occasion of the artists 1989 retrospective, is a tripartite igloo: the large, glass-covered structure is transparent and reveals smaller wood and rubber versions nestled within. As in all of Merzs sculptures (and much Arte Povera work in general), this piece embodies both beauty and violence: the shards of broken glass clamped onto this fragmented edifice are at once delicate and dangerous. The neon phrase Citta irreale (Italian for unreal city), suspended across a wire-mesh triangle on the dome, refers to the intensely subjective, surreal quality of Merzs art. Although the nomadic artist may shift from one location or style or medium to another, creating momentary theaters of meaning, the sites visited are, ultimately and essentially, places in the mind.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nHiroshi Sugimoto left his native Japan in 1970 to study art in Los Angeles in 1971 at a time when Minimalism and Conceptual artboth of which informed his workdominated art practice. Inspired by the systemic aspects of Minimalist painting and sculpture, he has consistently explored several themes with rigorous seriality throughout his career.The white screen that reappears in his Theaters series (begun in 1978) is itself the result of shooting the projection of a feature film. Photographing drive-ins, golden-age cinema palaces, and modern movie houses, he uses an exposure determined by the length of the screening. As each frame of film flickers by, the shifting action and light both cancels and accumulates until the film, shown in its entirety, is recorded as a bright, blank screen, appearing empty of imagery while actually filled to overflowing. Sugimoto calls this time exposedthe collecting, in one still image, of moments passed.His Seascapes series (begun in 1999) are photographed with cartographic precision. Each image, titled for the body of water depicted, is comprised of sea and sky bisected by the horizon. Rather than taming the subject through repeated documentation, the series grows more awesome and sublime, and the images reveal that only the temporary atmosphericsthe thickness of fog or stillness of the waterdistinguish one sea from the next.In his Portraits (begun in 1999), commissioned by the Deutsche Guggenheim, Sugimoto rekindles the dialogue between painting and the medium of mechanical reproduction. Sugimoto isolated wax figures from staged vignettes in waxworks museums, posed them in three-quarter-length view, and illuminated them to create haunting Rembrandt-esque portraits of historical figures, such as Henry VIII, Napoleon Bonaparte, Fidel Castro, and Princess Diana. His painterly renditions, lush with detail, recall the various paintings from which the wax figures were originally drawn. Through layers of reproductionfrom subject to painting to wax statue to photographthese images most consciously convey the collapsing of time and the retelling of history.Based on the long-standing association of black-and-white photography with the recording of truth, Sugimoto's photo-documents playfully reveal the illusion of this assumption. Sugimoto's Portraits provide photographic evidence of historical subjects and events previously uncaptured on film, just as his Theaters record what cannot be seen, the passage of time, and his Seascapes pinpoint what cannot be relocated.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the years after World War II, both Europe and America saw the rise of predominantly abstract painting concerned with materials and the expression of gesture and marking. New Yorkers dubbed the development in the U.S. Abstract Expressionism, while the French named the pan-European phenomenon of gestural painting Art Informel (literally \"unformed art\"). A variety of the latter was Tachisme, from the French word tache, meaning stain or blot. Antoni Tapies was among the artists to receive the label Tachiste because of the rich texture and pooled color that seemed to occur accidentally on his canvases.Tapies reevaluated humble materials, things of the earth such as sandwhich he used in Great Paintingand the refuse of humanity: string, bits of fabric, and straw. By calling attention to this seemingly inconsequential matter, he suggested that beauty can be found in unlikely places. Tapies saw his works as objects of meditation that every viewer will interpret according to personal experience; he sought to inspire a contemplative reaction to reality through the integration of materials unexpected in fine art. The act of contemplation is also inspired by the grand scale of much of Tapies's work. For example, the two panels of the gestural and atmospheric Ambroisie, completed nearly 30 years after Great Painting, extend the painted space to completely encompass the viewer.These images often resemble walls that have been marred by human intervention and the passage of time: the scumbled gray and white surface of Ambroisie, for example, suggests concrete that has been scrawled with graffiti. In Great Painting, an ocher skin appears to hang off the surface of the canvas; violence is suggested by the gouge and puncture marks in the dense stratum. These markings recall the scribbling of graffiti, perhaps referring to the public walls covered with slogans and images of protest that the artist saw as a youth in Cataloniaa region in Spain that experienced the harshest repression under dictator Francisco Franco. Tapies called walls the \"witnesses of the martyrdoms and inhuman sufferings inflicted on our people.\"1 Great Painting suggests the artist's poetic memorial to those who have perished and those who have endured.Jennifer Blessing1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nSherrie Levine emerged in the late 1970s as a member of a group of Conceptual artists known as the Pictures generation, a name derived from the seminal exhibition organized by Douglas Crimp for Artists Space in 1977. Immersed in the prevailing currents of critical theory, these artists used appropriation-based techniques to interrogate the assumptions surrounding visual representation. Whereas many of her contemporaries drew from the image bank of everyday life and the mass media, Levines best-known work finds a more rarified source in the annals of 20th-century art, appropriating from such modernist luminaries as Constantin Brancusi, Marcel Duchamp, Walker Evans, Gustav Klimt, Piet Mondrian, and Man Ray. After Rodchenko: 1-12 comprises twelve facsimiles of the work of the Russian Constructivist, whose celebrated photographs dating from the 1920s and 30s reflect both his interest in graphic abstraction and a fiercely communist ideology. The performative nature of Levines practice, in which she assumes, or impersonates, the identity of an artistic predecessor, has been interpreted by feminist critics as a subversive intervention in the rigid (and overwhelmingly male) construction of the art-historical canon. Levine, however, prefers to view her work as a regenerative act of collaboration, transforming the singular masterpiece into something fluid and perpetually renewable.Katherine Brinson\n",

Participating in this discourse, Allan McCollum reduced difference to a lowest common denominator in Surrogates, begun in 1978. Each painting in the series is unique in size but otherwise adheres to a formulaic pattern. More recently his Perpetual Photo series (198289) investigates the idea of the simulacra, a copy several degrees removed from the source, whose own existence is questionable. The artist photographs television stills and further abstracts his shots through cropping and enlargement to the point that the original image is impossible to locate. His manipulated picture frustrates the viewers gaze; and its pretense of representing something draws the eye into a cul-de-sac of seeing, yet continually defers recognition. One sees only an extracted image in a sepia-toned print, an abstract form meant to capture the essential nature of photography. Through a series of copies, McCollum has drawn out a tense, unstable original.Helen Hsu\n",

She is best known, however, for a series of intimate portraits of her children, which she began in 1984 and published in 1992 under the title Immediate Family. These lyrical black-and-white photographs, shot with an antique, 8 x 10 inch view camera, record Mann's son and two daughters growing up in the same unchanging landscape in which she was raised. The season is always summer and the children are usually outdoors, wearing little or no clothes. In some photographs, Mann's young subjects assume enigmatic poses in works that recall the staged allegories of the Victorian-era photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, who also worked with children. More typically, they are engaged in everyday, childhood activitiesswimming, dressing up, painting their bodiesor simply gazing assertively back at the camera.Mann's photographs of her children are at once specific and universal. She creates a deeply nostalgic and tender record of Emmett, Jessie, and Virginia, and their unique bodies and personalities, as if to freeze them before they slip out of childhood. At the same time, Mann is interested in viewing her children as part of a much larger cycle. She explains in her elegiac introduction to the series: \"We are spinning a story of what it is to grow up. It is a complicated story and sometimes we try to take on the grand themesanger, love, death, sensuality, and beauty.\" Mann does not shy away from the darker or more taboo aspects of childhood. In a number of works, she acknowledges the sexuality that is already present in childhood by capturing her children's naked bodies in poses that imply adult knowledge. In The Modest Child (1990), for instance, her five-year-old daughter covers her chest as if to suggest shame for breasts that have not yet developed. Other photographs fast-forward further in time, even hinting at the child's mortality. In the ambiguous and haunting Fallen Child (1989), Mann's daughter lies facedown on the ground, her eyes closed and her body bathed in a radiant, ethereal light.

    "description": "\nDescription\nAnnette Messager embarked on her artistic career amid the tumultuous climate surrounding the May 1968 student uprisings in Paris. It was in this atmosphere of radicalism that she discovered that art could be found in the streets and in the tasks of everyday life, rather than solely within the cloistered realm of the museum. Some of her early piecessuch as Boarders at Rest (197172), in which she clothed dozens of embalmed sparrows in tiny hand-knit sweaters, and My Collection of Proverbs (1974), a selection of mostly misogynistic phrases about women hastily embroidered on unhemmed squares of clothuse modest materials and techniques commonly associated with domesticity and often devalued as women's work. Her nostalgia-laden gestures belie the subversive messages of social concern in her art, in which the conflict between nature and civilization and the lack of sexual equality in society are recurrent themes.My Vows, a series begun in 1988, hovers between photography and sculpture. The works consist of numerous small black-and-white photographs of the human anatomy, often clustered in dense groupings, each print hung tenuously from the wall by a single, simple string. The body parts depicted in the photographsfrom a calloused toe to an ankle to the close-up image of a breastbelong to men and women of all ages and types. Together the photographs form an inclusive representation of humanity that is equally old and young, masculine and feminine, sensual and base, and often simultaneously humorous and poignant. Ultimately, they reflect an understanding of humanity that is not categorized by physical difference. My Vows may also be understood in relation to Messager's Catholic heritage; the work resembles the assembled votive offerings left at pilgrimage sites by the faithful, which often include accumulations of handwritten notes or miniatures of ailing limbs for which cures are being sought. The work's solemn reference is characteristic of the tension between lyricism and gravity that often informs Messager's art.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nCady Noland exposes the myth behind the promise of the American Dream. Her work addresses what she sees as Americas anxiety over the countrys failed pledge of freedom, security, and success for all. Combining iconic objects and images (flags, beer cans, celebrity photos, and the contents of tabloid newspapers) with base elements (grocery baskets, handcuffs, walkers, and portable metal barricades), Nolands output tends toward haphazard arrangements that signify impaired social and physical mobility. As in her massive 1989 installation of Budweiser beer cans, Nolands work also suggests a culture of excess and waste, a place in which the media and corporate interests distort events and objectify people. Her installations, which resemble works in progress rather than formal or finished pieces, speak of an abandoned planof hopes discarded like so many of the objects in her artwork.The anxious America that Noland depicts developed in part in the wake of the Vietnam War, the Kennedy assassinations, the brutal treatment of protestors at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, and Watergateevents that threatened the countrys image as a united, just, and invincible society. Noland has devoted many works to members of the cult of antiheroes, namely Lee Harvey Oswald and Patricia Hearst, who have long fascinated the public. Hearsts multiple personae, which ranged from fairytale princess to terrorist were subject to media exploitation (a journalistic practice established by her own familys newspapers). Hearst particularly interested Noland. Transferring silkscreen enlargements of media imagery onto brushed aluminum supports, Noland portrayed her in all her various guises. For example, SLA #4 features a torn newspaper photograph of Hearst and members of the Symbionese Liberation Army or SLAher kidnappers and later comradesencircling the leader Donald Cinque Mtume DeFreeze, who stands before the groups symbol, a seven-headed cobra.Like Andy Warhol before her, Noland finds silkscreen to be a particularly appropriate medium with which to exploit her subject matter. By using the techniques of mass production and consumption, she further exaggerates the medias own language and asks the viewer to question its claims of truth. And for Noland, Hearsts seeming crisis of identity parallels Americas own uncertain identity and profoundly expresses the disillusionment that the artist seeks to capture in her work.Joan Young\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe designation of an artist's late work\"as in the case of Paul Cezanne or Pablo Picassooften implies a slackening of formal criteria and an introspective, if not nostalgic, attitude that results, ultimately, in a clarity of vision. For Bourgeois, these qualities held true for an aesthetic production spanning six decades, during which she created a rich and ever-changing body of work that oscillates between abstraction and the visceral representation of psychic states. What unifies Bourgeois's myriad drawings, installations, and sculptural essays in marble, wood, metal, plaster, or latex is an intense emotional substance that at once exposes facets of her own personal history and confronts the bittersweet ordeal of being human. Present throughout the oeuvre is a fusion of seeming opposites, a deliberate dismantling of Western dualistic thought, which rends male from female, order from chaos, good from evil, pleasure from pain. In many of her anthropomorphic sculptures, Bourgeois merged images of breasts and vaginas with representations of penises to create ambiguous but, nevertheless, complete entities. The tension between diametrically opposed emotional statesaggression and impotence, desire and rejection, terror and fortitudewas explored in her late work.In haunting assemblages of collected objects that trigger memory and association, Bourgeois contemplated the various permutations of pain. According to the artist, the elegant sculpture Le Defi (1991) symbolizes self-preservation in the face of adversity and anguish. Composed of delicately but tenaciously balanced shelves supporting manifold glass containers and mirrors, all of which belonged to Bourgeois, Le Defi suggests the strength achieved by acknowledging, even embracing, vulnerability. Whereas her carved stone sculptures represent defense against pain through rigiditya resistance under pressurethe open, transparent vessels in this work signified, for Bourgeois, the courage to reveal feelings of inadequacy, fear, and loneliness. The soft light that shines through them from a hidden source of illumination expresses the will to adopt this particular strategy of defense, in which one is utterly exposed yet self-possessed and thus secure. Fragile yet resilient, ephemeral yet exceedingly tangible, Le Defi is essentially a three-dimensional poem that bespeaks the emotional struggles at the core of Bourgeois's art.Nancy Spector\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nStan Douglas utilizes forms of popular entertainmentcinema and televisionto destabilize narratives that depict society as a unified, homogeneous front with one history, one set of desires, and one value system. Whether emulating the evening news during the 1968 race riots or restaging a scene from Alfred Hitchcocks Marnie, Douglas disrupts representational systems by introducing unsettling elements of difference. Issues of race and class infiltrate his entire project.Douglass Monodramas, ten 30- to 60-second videos conceived as interventions into commercial television, interrupted the usual flow of advertising and entertainment when broadcast nightly in British Columbia for three weeks in 1992. These micronarratives mimic televisions editing techniques, but as kernels of a story they refuse to cohere. They are tales of dysfunction and dislocation, misanthropy and misunderstanding: a car and a school bus nearly collide at an intersection, only to drive away; a pedestrian greets an Afro-Canadian man he encounters on the street but is told in response, Im not Gary. When the videos were aired unannounced during commercial breaks, viewers called the station to inquire about what was being sold, their responses evincing how the media can refocus attention from content to consumption.The film installation Der Sandmann investigates the intersection of history and memory as witnessed against the backdrop of postCold War Germany. Shot on 16mm film in the old Ufa studios near Potsdam, the piece fuses E.T.A. Hoffmanns eponymous tale, Freuds citation of it in The Uncanny, his study of repression and repetition, as well as the social impulses behind 19th-century German urban planning, which instituted the Schrebergarten, plots of leasable land on which the poor could grow their own food. Projected as two separate but intersecting videos showing the garden at different chronological pointsin use during the 1960s and as a construction site some 20 years laterDer Sandmann contemplates temporality and the transformative effects of history.Nutka similarly utilizes image bifurcation, this time to explore the history of colonialization on Vancouver Island, where English and Spanish fleets battled over trade routes in the 18th century. Films of the landscapethe only imagery shownare superimposed on one screen so that the footage appears doubled. This formal effect is echoed by the soundtrack, which includes excerpts from the sea captains diaries, which become increasingly paranoid and irrational. At key moments in the narrative all visual and verbal elements meld together in exquisite clarity.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nBetween 1972 and 1974, Nan Goldin shot black-and-white photographs of her friends at The Other Side, a drag bar in Boston, in her words to pay homage to those whose third gender . . . made more sense than either of the other two. Ivy with Marilyn, Boston, from this body of work, presages her subsequent groundbreaking color images in content and style. In this portrait of a person with whom the artist is personally involved, made on the scene, rather than in a studio, Ivy, a pre-op transsexual, embodies the gender ambiguity that Goldin found so liberating. Goldin frequently portrays her subjects, which include herself, in their homes or socializing in clubs and bars. Elements of the decorsuch as masks or in this photograph, the Andy Warhol poster of Marilyn Monroeoften echo the belief in identity as a performance of a personal ideal, one that may be at odds with mainstream conceptions of gender.After finishing art school in 1978, Goldin moved to New York, where she continued to photograph her friendsartists and performers, denizens of the burgeoning East Village underground. By this time she was using color film and assembling her vast archive of slides into an ever-expanding show accompanied by an evocative music track, which she presented in clubs in the early 1980s. In her influential book, The Ballad of Sexual Dependency (1986), she focused on relationships and daringly portrayed her and her friends' passionate encounters. The Ballad, which includes portraits of individuals, images of separate and mixed-gender groups, and shots of coupling, partying, and violent acting out, suggests a passage from euphoria to dysphoria and back in an endless cycle of pleasure and pain. In Trixie on the cot, NYC, the artifice of her outfitthrift-shop party dress, heavy make-up, and doll-like hair ribbonsevokes an exaggerated femininity, a self-presentation that dovetailed with a growing mainstream questioning of gender. Greer and Robert on the bed, NYC, also from the book, hints at an inevitable discord between a heterosexual couple, but as in most of Goldin's work, their gender is mutable and fluid.Goldin's timely subject matter subsequently serves as a loving memorial to a community ravaged by drug addiction and AIDS. Formally, her deft use of lush color, as well as her large-scale (76.2 x 101.6 cm) Cibachrome prints, made Goldin both a leader in the phenomenal expansion of color photography into contemporary art in the 1980s as well as an inspiration for other artists through the 1990s.\n",

While recalling Carl Andres metal carpets, Donald Judds sequenced boxes, and Robert Morriss Corner Piece of 1964, they undermine the supposed neutrality of such work. He reintroduced what has been sublimated in much Modernist artdesire, loss, vulnerability, and angerwith a potent but quiet poignancy through texts inscribed on giveaway paper sheets and subtitles appended to untitled works. Free for the taking and replaceable, Gonzalez-Torress perpetually shrinking and swelling sculptures defy the macho solidity of Minimalist form, while playfully expanding upon the seriality of the genre and the quotidian nature of its materials.His early text pieces are lists of seemingly random historical incidents followed by the dates of their occurrence, for example, Pol Pot 1975 Prague 1968 Robocop 1987 H Bomb 1954 Wheel of Fortune 1968 Spud. Concurrently, he created similar inventories of gay-rights events and the AIDS crisis, culminating in the 1989 Greenwich Village billboard on which he commemorated in list form a history of oppression, illness, and activism. A self-acknowledged gay man who suffered the death of his longtime companion, Gonzalez-Torres expressed his grief and love for this manas well as his outrage at a social system that marginalizes homosexualsin much of his work. A stack piece bearing the simple message Memorial Day gives a new, haunting meaning to this generally trivialized American holiday; the festive and seductive spill of silver-wrapped candies subtitled Placebo (1991) ironically invokes the controversial and discriminatory modes of drug-testing in AIDS research. Untitled (Public Opinion), a 700-pound spill of black-rod licorice pieces, displayable as either a corner piece or a carpet, is a dark, aggressive work. The missilelike shape of the candy and its brooding, almost sinister, appearance alludes to our cultures pervasive militaristic outlook and hostile hegemonic stance. As an artwork produced in a conservative political climate, the sculpture also refers to the still pervasive censorship in America and suggests that public opinion is not as informed as it once was.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nA self-proclaimed \"blue-collar anarchist,\" Mike Kelley conducted a revolution that was not one of active aggression or trailblazing polemics. Instead, he devised an aesthetics of delinquency through which he identified with the underdog and debunked the two organizing principles of 20th-century thought: capitalism and psychoanalysis. As a student at CalArts in Los Angeles during the mid-1970s, he developed a unique performance style. At that time Kelley's sculptures were \"demonstrational\" in the sense that he \"performed\" them by using the works as props during performances that incorporated Surrealist-inspired, trancelike writings with sculptural objects and dance. He created bizarre systems of logic that inverted the reductivist, critical tendencies of Conceptual art while introducing a vocabulary that was decidedly irreverent, even adolescent in tone. Although he stopped performing in 1986, his subsequent stand-alone sculptures still function as sites in which narratives of transgression unfold. Riddle of the Sphinx embodies many of Kelley's themes and, to some extent, sums up his initial post-performance project Half a Man, in which he embraced dejection as the antithesis of masculine authority. He conceived this series in reaction to the heroicized, masculinist tenor of what he called \"I-beam\" Minimalism and the slick commodity critique of Neo-Conceptualism. The Half a Man project flaunted a stereotypically feminized sensibility, utilizing knitted afghans, sewn banners with slacker slogans, and old, grungy stuffed animals. To prevent empathetic identification with the toys, he arranged them according to typologies or placed them on afghans to stress figure-ground relationships in an ironic evocation of painterly convention. Eventually, he concealed the animals under the afghans, deliberately repressing their visual appearance in a pitiful version of hide-and-seek. In Riddle of the Sphinx, he substituted metal bowls for the veiled toys, the number of which corresponds to the question posed to Oedipus in Sophocles's drama: What walks on four legs in the morning, two at noon, and three in the evening? The passage of this metaphorical day is echoed in the hues of the afghan, which range in color from pale to dusky and match, in a kitsch moment, an accompanying print of Mount Fuji. Solving the riddle with the answer \"Man\" (as the measure of all things), Oedipus conquers the Sphinx and secures his own tragic fate. By situating the founding myth of patriarchy and Freudian psychology in the playfully pathetic realm of this floor-bound, camouflaging installation, Kelley associated the Oedipal complexand, by extension, castration anxietywith his antihero, the \"half a man.\"  Nancy Spector\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1963 Roy Lichtenstein defended Pop art against its critics, contending that there are certain things that are usable, forceful, and vital about commercial art. By choosing comic-book illustrations as a theme, and using simulated Benday dots to suggest cheap printing, Lichtenstein acknowledged (and perhaps questioned) the role of this popular form of entertainment in daily life. There is also an element of humor in creating fine art out of what has customarily been considered low, a playfulness that is equally evident in the onomatopoeic caption and bellicose expression of the dog in Grrrrrrrrrrr!! (1965)Lichtenstein cultivated imagery from the history of art while continuing to use the conventions of comics and advertisements. In Preparedness (1968) he used the Benday-dot technique to make a wall-size painting (10 feet high by 18 feet wide) that suggests the work of Fernand Leger and the WPA artists of the 1930s, who painted monumental murals, readable at a distance, on themes of workers and everyday life. Lichtenstein followed this practice to an ironic and somewhat subversive end. Painted during a year when public opinion on the Vietnam War shifted dramatically, Lichtensteins massive depiction of machinery and soldiers probes the conventions of selling the promises of the military-industrial complex, while quietly alluding to the naive optimism underlying a call to arms.Lichtenstein often focused on the way his traditional and mass-media sources resolve the dilemmas of representing three dimensions on a flat picture plane, incorporating their solutions into his own work with witty exaggeration. Preparedness plays the fragmented Cubist collage space of Leger against comic-strip modes of suggesting form and the surface quality of objects. Lichtensteins inclusion of an airplane window in the third panel of the painting foreshadows his engagement with modes of conveying the illusion of reflective glass, which he went on to explore in a series of paintings of mirrors. Interior with Mirrored Wall (1991) is a later development of this exploration. In a series of works depicting banal domestic environments inspired by furniture ads he found in telephone books, Lichtenstein continued his previous investigations of illusionistic representational devices, here by including the eponymous mirrored wall and the gleaming, polished grand piano. His references to high-art sources included his own work, which is shown framed on the wall. The floor covering also implicitly acknowledges Henri Matisses use of decorative patterns.Jennifer Blessing\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nGlenn Ligon explores questions of African American identity and queer sexuality in a variety of media. He is best known for his paintings incorporating texts by influential cultural figures ranging from writers James Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston, and Jean Genet to comedian Richard Pryor. In works Ligon made for the seminal series Door Paintings (199092), the artist used black oil stick to stencil repeated phrases such as I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background and I remember the very day that I became colored (both from Hurstons 1928 essay, How It Feels to Be Colored Me) on primed white wooden doors. As Ligon worked, he allowed the oil stick to clog the stencil and smudge across the paintings surface, causing the phrases to blur and become less decipherable as they progress to the bottom of the panel. By disturbing the legibility of the texts, Ligon slows and interrupts the process of reading, collapsing it into seeing. The relentless repetition of a single phrase, detached from its original context, encourages the viewer to continually reevaluate the possible meanings of the text until it becomes thick with implication. The act of coloring these doors, with their human scale and subtle allusions to opportunity, passing, and passages, is analogous to the manner in which black bodies are inscribed with meaning within American society. In this sense, these initial works perform one implication of Hurstons text and question the ways in which bodies and images become legible within culture. Ligon later extended this technique to canvas and drew on quotes from activist Jesse Jackson, writer Ralph Ellison, and rapper Ice Cube, among others.\nLigons Coloring series, begun in 2000, further explores themes of becoming colored and the legibility of black bodies, but focuses on images rather than text. In a series of workshops Ligon conducted at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, the artist asked young children to color pictures from 1970s-era coloring books featuring African American cultural figures, which had been created to foster knowledge of black history and pride in black culture among African American children. Ligon then used the childrens work as source material for a series of paintings, screenprinting the coloring-book pages onto canvas and coloring them as in the childrens drawings, although with paint and oil stick. The results are often jarring: deaf to the ideology of the images, the young workshop participants colored irreverently, giving Frederick Douglass blue eyes and adding lipstick, rouge, and eye shadow to a portrait of Malcolm X. Some illustrations are filled in carefully, while others are obliterated by dense scribbles. At once playful and disturbing, Ligons paintings highlight the slippery nature of representation, and the apparent desecration of these cultural icons provokes an anxiety in the viewer that exposes the ideologically loaded process of reading an image. By highlighting this process, Ligon emphasizes the unsettling extent to which the meaning of an image is socially determined, and questions the ways in which we transmit our systems of meaning to future generations. \nLiz Blackford \n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nSally Mann has photographed a range of subjects since the late 1970s, from the people and environs of her hometown in rural Virginia, to desolate Southern plantations and somber Civil War sites. She is best known, however, for a series of intimate portraits of her children, which she began in 1984 and published in 1992 under the title Immediate Family. These lyrical black-and-white photographs, shot with an antique, 8 x 10 inch view camera, record Mann's son and two daughters growing up in the same unchanging landscape in which she was raised. The season is always summer and the children are usually outdoors, wearing little or no clothes. In some photographs, Mann's young subjects assume enigmatic poses in works that recall the staged allegories of the Victorian-era photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, who also worked with children. More typically, they are engaged in everyday, childhood activitiesswimming, dressing up, painting their bodiesor simply gazing assertively back at the camera.Mann's photographs of her children are at once specific and universal. She creates a deeply nostalgic and tender record of Emmett, Jessie, and Virginia, and their unique bodies and personalities, as if to freeze them before they slip out of childhood. At the same time, Mann is interested in viewing her children as part of a much larger cycle. She explains in her elegiac introduction to the series: \"We are spinning a story of what it is to grow up. It is a complicated story and sometimes we try to take on the grand themesanger, love, death, sensuality, and beauty.\" Mann does not shy away from the darker or more taboo aspects of childhood. In a number of works, she acknowledges the sexuality that is already present in childhood by capturing her children's naked bodies in poses that imply adult knowledge. In The Modest Child (1990), for instance, her five-year-old daughter covers her chest as if to suggest shame for breasts that have not yet developed. Other photographs fast-forward further in time, even hinting at the child's mortality. In the ambiguous and haunting Fallen Child (1989), Mann's daughter lies facedown on the ground, her eyes closed and her body bathed in a radiant, ethereal light. With grass scattered all over her still body, she appears to belong to the earth.Ted Mann\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nGabriel Orozco's multimedia works are philosophical investigations of form, medium, and installation. In his own exhibitions, he often employs sculpture, drawing, photography, installation, and video and recycles older work into sometimes new mediums and contexts. The readymade is central to Orozco's process. He frequently manipulates what he discovers by arranging found materials (a deflated soccer ball, cans of cat food, simple planks of wood) and photographing his constructions. Sometimes he transforms the ordinary just by suggesting a form in a seemingly banal image, as in Pulpo (Octopus, 1991), which bestows meaning on a tangle of pipes. Here the readymade is not so much a thing found as a dynamic and poetic interaction between artist and object.Orozco plays photography and sculpture off against one another to create compelling hybrids in the service of his interest in the lightening of mass. This involves streamlining or hollowing out objects that at first appear heavy and cumbersome, as in the sculpture La DS (1993, pronounced like la deesse, French for goddess), a trisected Citroen automobile seamlessly reassembled without the middle section. In Dos Parejas (Two Couples, 1990), heavy industrial objects are playfully anthropomorphized by their title as their sculptural mass is negated through photographic reproduction. In Photogravity (1999), Orozco mounted large versions of his old photographs on spindly legs to produce a sort of two-dimensional sculpture. He uses one medium to expose another's limits: photography can strip sculpture of its mass, but it always lacks the real thing that it pictures.Orozco's photographs document chance encounters with sites and objects in his native Mexico and other locations around the world, including Brazil, Germany, Iceland, India, and New York. Im looking for different kinds of contexts . . . I want to make something in a very clean, white space. Then I want to get outside . . . I grew up in museums, but I also grew up in the streets. Acutely attentive to the various receptions his work engenders in different locations, he seeks to make his viewers aware of their own cultural boundedness. His work ultimately promotes deterritorialization, within which a multiplicity of viewpoints is recognized and none can take precedence. Pelota en agua (Ball on Water, 1994) first appears to be a photograph of a cloud-streaked sky, but turns out to be a reflection captured in a puddle, evidenced by a half-submerged ball. This conflation of sky and earth, lofty and lowly, is emblematic of Orozco's attempt to bridge the distance between oppositional themes and sites.\n",

However, as in other art of her generation, a nuanced exploration of identity serves as the foundation of Simpson's work. In Flipside (1991), the artist questions the meaning of what is natural in relation to hairstyles and African origins. The left panel of Flipside depicts a black woman with an Afrocentric, natural hairstyle, flanked on the right by a panel showing an African mask, both seen from behind. The work's title, Flipside, thus refers to the fact that both the mask and the woman are seen from the back, or flip side. Curving flutes on the mask also echo the flip hairstyle of the early 1960s and associate the mask with this refined look. The Afro, a natural style with political connotations, was adopted only later in that decade. The plaque beneath the photos reads: The neighbors were suspicious of her hairstyle, suggesting some of the complex social significances of hair. The B quality of the flipside of a 45the popular vinyl record standard in the days of its eponymous hairdoalso alludes to and critiques the way in which notions of hairstyle parallel the reception of African masks in modernism. Both are seen as primitive cultural products that inspire and are subsumed into Western art, and yet somehow remain outside dominant art historical narratives.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nHiroshi Sugimoto left his native Japan in 1970 to study art in Los Angeles in 1971 at a time when Minimalism and Conceptual artboth of which informed his workdominated art practice. Inspired by the systemic aspects of Minimalist painting and sculpture, he has consistently explored several themes with rigorous seriality throughout his career.The white screen that reappears in his Theaters series (begun in 1978) is itself the result of shooting the projection of a feature film. Photographing drive-ins, golden-age cinema palaces, and modern movie houses, he uses an exposure determined by the length of the screening. As each frame of film flickers by, the shifting action and light both cancels and accumulates until the film, shown in its entirety, is recorded as a bright, blank screen, appearing empty of imagery while actually filled to overflowing. Sugimoto calls this time exposedthe collecting, in one still image, of moments passed.His Seascapes series (begun in 1999) are photographed with cartographic precision. Each image, titled for the body of water depicted, is comprised of sea and sky bisected by the horizon. Rather than taming the subject through repeated documentation, the series grows more awesome and sublime, and the images reveal that only the temporary atmosphericsthe thickness of fog or stillness of the waterdistinguish one sea from the next.In his Portraits (begun in 1999), commissioned by the Deutsche Guggenheim, Sugimoto rekindles the dialogue between painting and the medium of mechanical reproduction. Sugimoto isolated wax figures from staged vignettes in waxworks museums, posed them in three-quarter-length view, and illuminated them to create haunting Rembrandt-esque portraits of historical figures, such as Henry VIII, Napoleon Bonaparte, Fidel Castro, and Princess Diana. His painterly renditions, lush with detail, recall the various paintings from which the wax figures were originally drawn. Through layers of reproductionfrom subject to painting to wax statue to photographthese images most consciously convey the collapsing of time and the retelling of history.Based on the long-standing association of black-and-white photography with the recording of truth, Sugimoto's photo-documents playfully reveal the illusion of this assumption. Sugimoto's Portraits provide photographic evidence of historical subjects and events previously uncaptured on film, just as his Theaters record what cannot be seen, the passage of time, and his Seascapes pinpoint what cannot be relocated.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWolfgang Tillmans's photographs of friends, dance raves, clubs, and night life have appeared regularly in London's i-D magazine and other publications since 1989. Though his work has had a tremendous impact on the studied casualness of much recent fashion photography, Tillmans is not a \"fashion photographer.\" If anything he is a portraitist who often photographs his friendswho appear alternately tough, vulnerable, loving, ferocious, gay, and straightin intimate situations. Though these probing images reflect his own subjective experiences, they also operate on a more general level, recording a specific dimension of our contemporary culture. Tillmans establishes a collaborative process with his models, whom he calls \"accomplices.\" Thus the informal look of the works belies their choreographed construction. Landscape and still-life images also play a crucial role in his oeuvre, in which half-eaten fruit, sewer rats, crumpled clothing, or urban skylines are photographed with the same dignity and attention to beauty as his human subjects. Traditional subject genres are questioned; crumpled clothing might suggest a figure or landscape, while city scenes seen from the air resemble a still life of objects.For Tillmans, the images are only half the work; the installation or layout constitutes its completion. He affixes his prints directly to the wall with pins or tape, juxtaposing old and new images of varying sizes and mediums. He eschews standard darkroom procedures, blurring the lines between color and black and white (printing black-and-white images on color paper, for instance). Color photographs are placed next to inkjet prints and next to postcards and magazine clippings of his own images, contesting conventional hierarchies of scale and subject matter while drawing focus to the materiality of the photographic medium all within a carefully composed environment that seems to disdain permanency.\n",

These mesmerizing and often inscrutable works, which are frequently placed outside traditional museum spaces, deploy unconventional materials as a way to elicit sensory responses and to obliquely reference historical and cultural meanings derived from the artists studies of a particular site. Her repertoire of materials has included several tons of horsehair, thousands of honey-coated pennies, beetle-infested turkey carcasses, and hundreds of pounds of work uniforms. Typically, a lone individual intently engaged in a repetitive taskburning words from a book, wringing his or her hands in honey, or unraveling a length of fabricinhabits her environments, lending the intimacy of human touch.\nHamilton thus translates intellectual and social constructs into corporeal impulses, building up a collage of metaphors that speak to the conditions of lived experience as well as to the history of a particular place. With their allusions to experience, memory, and desire, her installations mine the intersection between the individual body and the social body. By emphasizing material presence and appealing to the senses, they suggest that knowledge is gained both corporeally and intellectually. This notion is also conveyed by the works small scale, which transforms the traditional relationship between viewer and object by literally bringing the viewer into the physical space of the artwork.\nHamiltons work foregrounds sensory experience and evokes memories that are rooted in the body, operating in a seemingly prelinguistic or entirely nonverbal realm.

The uniformity within each series is disrupted by the sitter's emotional and physical particularities, which often expressly communicate a tension heightened by his or her shifting state.Although she isolates the bathers in her Beaches series (199296) and frames them with only sea and sky, Dijkstra reveals much about them by capturing a subtle gesture or expression in these unguarded moments that reside somewhere between the posed and the natural. The end result is a collaboration between sitter and photographer, a record, however partial, of their interaction. In photographing the already awkward young subjects in their bathing suits, Dijkstra sets up a situation marked by exposure and self-consciousness that parallels the uneasy passage between childhood and adulthood. The images represent individuals from various countries and, as a whole, add up to a meditation on adolescent disconcertment. The photograph is the ideal medium for Dijkstra's practice precisely because of its explicit suspension of the movement of time: like Dijkstra's subjects, photographs are always between one moment and another.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nEmploying only commercial fluorescent lights in his work, Dan Flavin devised a radical new art form that circumvented the limits imposed by frames, pedestals, or other conventional means of display. His embrace of the unadorned fluorescent fixture as an aesthetic object placed him at the forefront of a generation of artists whose use of industrial materials, emphasis on elementary forms, and nonhierarchical relationships among component parts became the salient characteristics of Minimalism.The additive composition of the nominal three (to William of Ockham), dedicated to the 14th-century English philosopher, exemplifies Flavins use of the fluorescent tube as a basic building block. The artists installations became increasingly complex while remaining bound to the limited palette and standard lengths in which the fixtures were commercially produced. His subsequent development of a vocabulary of corners, barriers, and corridors engaged the environment his work occupied and revealed his interest in reconceptualizing sculpture in relation to space. The first of his barrier pieces, greens crossing greens (to Piet Mondrian who lacked green), transforms and even inverts the conventional museum experience by literally invading the viewers space and prohibiting access to the gallery. The reference to Mondrian is in keeping with Flavins practice of dedicating individual works to family, friends, or historical figures of significance to him.The artist Mel Bochner credited Flavins practice as embodying an acute awareness of the phenomenology of rooms. This awareness stemmed from Flavins rejection of studio production in favor of site-specific situations or proposals (as the artist preferred to classify his work) and is nowhere more evident than in his 1971 installation for the Guggenheim, untitled (to Ward Jackson, an old friend and colleague who, during the Fall of 1957 when I finally returned to New York from Washington and joined him to work together in this museum, kindly communicated). Initially occupying one full turn of the museums ramps, and according to the artist, critically fitted to the inconsistent dimensions of the variable architecture, the work was conceived so that it could be extended to fill the entire rotunda, as was done in 1992. At that time, Flavin incorporated untitled (to Ward Jackson . . . ) into an new work dedicated to his fiancee, untitled (to Tracy, to celebrate the love of a lifetime), which featured a column rising from the rotunda floor in a celebratory manner, suffusing the space with a warm pink glow. Together these installations amplified the Frank Lloyd Wright interior, exemplifying Flavins career-long concern with light, space, and color.J. Fiona Ragheb\r\n        ",

Ivy with Marilyn, Boston, from this body of work, presages her subsequent groundbreaking color images in content and style. In this portrait of a person with whom the artist is personally involved, made on the scene, rather than in a studio, Ivy, a pre-op transsexual, embodies the gender ambiguity that Goldin found so liberating. Goldin frequently portrays her subjects, which include herself, in their homes or socializing in clubs and bars. Elements of the decorsuch as masks or in this photograph, the Andy Warhol poster of Marilyn Monroeoften echo the belief in identity as a performance of a personal ideal, one that may be at odds with mainstream conceptions of gender.After finishing art school in 1978, Goldin moved to New York, where she continued to photograph her friendsartists and performers, denizens of the burgeoning East Village underground. By this time she was using color film and assembling her vast archive of slides into an ever-expanding show accompanied by an evocative music track, which she presented in clubs in the early 1980s. In her influential book, The Ballad of Sexual Dependency (1986), she focused on relationships and daringly portrayed her and her friends' passionate encounters. The Ballad, which includes portraits of individuals, images of separate and mixed-gender groups, and shots of coupling, partying, and violent acting out, suggests a passage from euphoria to dysphoria and back in an endless cycle of pleasure and pain. In Trixie on the cot, NYC, the artifice of her outfitthrift-shop party dress, heavy make-up, and doll-like hair ribbonsevokes an exaggerated femininity, a self-presentation that dovetailed with a growing mainstream questioning of gender. Greer and Robert on the bed, NYC, also from the book, hints at an inevitable discord between a heterosexual couple, but as in most of Goldin's work, their gender is mutable and fluid.Goldin's timely subject matter subsequently serves as a loving memorial to a community ravaged by drug addiction and AIDS. Formally, her deft use of lush color, as well as her large-scale (76.2 x 101.6 cm) Cibachrome prints, made Goldin both a leader in the phenomenal expansion of color photography into contemporary art in the 1980s as well as an inspiration for other artists through the 1990s.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nJeff Koons rose to prominence in the mid-1980s as part of a generation of artists who explored the meaning of art in a media-saturated era and the attendant crisis of representation. With his stated artistic intention to communicate with the masses, Koons draws from the visual language of advertising, marketing, and the entertainment industry. Testing the limits between popular and elite culture, his sculptural menagerie includes Plexiglas-encased Hoover vacuum cleaners, basketballs suspended in glass aquariums, photographs of himself coupled with his then-wife Ilona Staller, also known as La Cicciolina (former adult-film star and member of Italian parliament), and porcelain homages to Michael Jackson and the Pink Panther. In extending the lineage of Dada and Marcel Duchamp, and integrating references to Minimalism and Pop, Koons stages art as a commodity that cannot be placed within the hierarchy of conventional aesthetics.\r\nKoons's series Easyfun-Ethereal foregrounds happy-face deli sandwiches, spiraling roller-coaster rides, and windswept hair all set against sublime landscapes. The artist combines familiar yet unrelated images to create collagelike paintings rendered with photorealist perfection. These works recall the advertising iconography and billboard-style painting technique present in James Rosenquist's canvases. Koons's new brand of Pop painting cleverly engages other art-historical references, in particular Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism. Sandwiches, for example, is a disjunctive, free-floating fantasy. The collage of animated deli-meats, the turkey made of ice cream, and the cartoon eye and moustache recall the free-associative visual games of Salvador Dali, Max Ernst, and Rene Magritte, while the background streams and splashes of milk echo the abstractions of Jackson Pollock. Koons's fusion of Pop representations with Surrealist and abstract overtones creates a hybrid of fun and fantasy, yielding a body of work that depicts gravity-defying forms of dreamlike pleasure.In Puppy, Koons engages both past and present, employing sophisticated computer modeling while referencing the 18th-century formal garden. A behemoth West Highland terrier carpeted in bedding plants, Puppy combines the most saccharine of iconographyflowers and puppiesin a monument to the sentimental. Its sizeseemingly out-of-control (it is both literally and figuratively still growing) but carefully constructed and tightly containedcan be read as an analogue of contemporary culture. Dignified and stalwart, this work fills us with awe, and even joy, while standing guard at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. In keeping with themes in his past work, Koons has, by combining elite references (topiary and dog breeding) with those of the masses (Chia Pets and Hallmark greeting cards), designed this public sculpture to relentlessly entice, to create optimism, and to instill, in his own words, confidence and security.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn his most well-known body of work, made in the early 1990s, Glenn Ligon painted door-sized canvases white and then stenciled across and down them black text appropriated from such influential authors as James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison, and Zora Neale Hurston. These phrases, such as How it feels to be colored menot an emphatic statement, but an endlessly open questionare repeated until the stenciling blurs into illegibility. This and the removal of the text from its original literary context wonderfully complicate both language and meaning. Foregrounding race and sexuality, Ligon's work is primarily concerned with the construction of black identity as it is articulated through words and images.In 1986, Robert Mapplethorpe published The Black Book, a selection of his many idealized and homoerotic nude photographs of black men. The book incited a range of responses, from appreciative identification to moral outrage, from distant ambivalence to personal embarrassment. Ligon, too, responded to the book, scrawling his reactions to each image on the pages of his copy. Realizing that he wanted to sort out the effect these images of black masculinity had on him as well as on others, he conceived of Notes on the Margin of the Black Book (199193). Maintaining Mapplethorpe's original order, Ligon installed framed pages from The Black Book along the wall in two rows, inserting between them small framed typed texts by diverse sources, including philosophers, activists, curators, historians, and religious evangelists. These seventy-odd texts, some written specifically about Mapplethorpe's images, others not, suggest a variety of interpretations while also foregrounding the various fears and fantasies projected onto these black male nudes, as the quote from Baldwin makes clear: What one's imagination makes of other people is dictated, of course, by the laws of one's own personality and it is one of the ironies of black-white relations that, by means of what the white man imagines the black man to be, the black man is enabled to know who the white man is. In Notes, as in all of Ligon's work, sex, race, and desire cannot be disentangled, and questions are raised about the complex nature of the self and its relation to culture.

He is best known for his paintings incorporating texts by influential cultural figures ranging from writers James Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston, and Jean Genet to comedian Richard Pryor. In works Ligon made for the seminal series Door Paintings (199092), the artist used black oil stick to stencil repeated phrases such as I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background and I remember the very day that I became colored (both from Hurstons 1928 essay, How It Feels to Be Colored Me) on primed white wooden doors. As Ligon worked, he allowed the oil stick to clog the stencil and smudge across the paintings surface, causing the phrases to blur and become less decipherable as they progress to the bottom of the panel. By disturbing the legibility of the texts, Ligon slows and interrupts the process of reading, collapsing it into seeing. The relentless repetition of a single phrase, detached from its original context, encourages the viewer to continually reevaluate the possible meanings of the text until it becomes thick with implication. The act of coloring these doors, with their human scale and subtle allusions to opportunity, passing, and passages, is analogous to the manner in which black bodies are inscribed with meaning within American society. In this sense, these initial works perform one implication of Hurstons text and question the ways in which bodies and images become legible within culture.

In a series of workshops Ligon conducted at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, the artist asked young children to color pictures from 1970s-era coloring books featuring African American cultural figures, which had been created to foster knowledge of black history and pride in black culture among African American children. Ligon then used the childrens work as source material for a series of paintings, screenprinting the coloring-book pages onto canvas and coloring them as in the childrens drawings, although with paint and oil stick. The results are often jarring: deaf to the ideology of the images, the young workshop participants colored irreverently, giving Frederick Douglass blue eyes and adding lipstick, rouge, and eye shadow to a portrait of Malcolm X. Some illustrations are filled in carefully, while others are obliterated by dense scribbles. At once playful and disturbing, Ligons paintings highlight the slippery nature of representation, and the apparent desecration of these cultural icons provokes an anxiety in the viewer that exposes the ideologically loaded process of reading an image. By highlighting this process, Ligon emphasizes the unsettling extent to which the meaning of an image is socially determined, and questions the ways in which we transmit our systems of meaning to future generations. \nLiz Blackford \n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nGabriel Orozco's multimedia works are philosophical investigations of form, medium, and installation. In his own exhibitions, he often employs sculpture, drawing, photography, installation, and video and recycles older work into sometimes new mediums and contexts. The readymade is central to Orozco's process. He frequently manipulates what he discovers by arranging found materials (a deflated soccer ball, cans of cat food, simple planks of wood) and photographing his constructions. Sometimes he transforms the ordinary just by suggesting a form in a seemingly banal image, as in Pulpo (Octopus, 1991), which bestows meaning on a tangle of pipes. Here the readymade is not so much a thing found as a dynamic and poetic interaction between artist and object.Orozco plays photography and sculpture off against one another to create compelling hybrids in the service of his interest in the lightening of mass. This involves streamlining or hollowing out objects that at first appear heavy and cumbersome, as in the sculpture La DS (1993, pronounced like la deesse, French for goddess), a trisected Citroen automobile seamlessly reassembled without the middle section. In Dos Parejas (Two Couples, 1990), heavy industrial objects are playfully anthropomorphized by their title as their sculptural mass is negated through photographic reproduction. In Photogravity (1999), Orozco mounted large versions of his old photographs on spindly legs to produce a sort of two-dimensional sculpture. He uses one medium to expose another's limits: photography can strip sculpture of its mass, but it always lacks the real thing that it pictures.Orozco's photographs document chance encounters with sites and objects in his native Mexico and other locations around the world, including Brazil, Germany, Iceland, India, and New York. Im looking for different kinds of contexts . . . I want to make something in a very clean, white space. Then I want to get outside . . . I grew up in museums, but I also grew up in the streets. Acutely attentive to the various receptions his work engenders in different locations, he seeks to make his viewers aware of their own cultural boundedness. His work ultimately promotes deterritorialization, within which a multiplicity of viewpoints is recognized and none can take precedence. Pelota en agua (Ball on Water, 1994) first appears to be a photograph of a cloud-streaked sky, but turns out to be a reflection captured in a puddle, evidenced by a half-submerged ball. This conflation of sky and earth, lofty and lowly, is emblematic of Orozco's attempt to bridge the distance between oppositional themes and sites.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nHaving long cultivated his status as a renegade, Richard Prince frequently traffics in American symbols of rebellion, such as motorcycles and cowboys. It is not surprising, then, that in 1987, during an extended stay in Los Angeles, he trained his focus on the subculture surrounding the American car. He began painting on muscle-car hoodsor more specifically, fiberglass reproductions of steel originals. He has said:With the hoods, I wanted to paint something that was already painted. I liked the way certain streetcars are painted. Flat, primed, flaked, the occasional stripe or decal or logo. There are advertisements for these hoods in the backs of car magazines. You send away for them. I get them through the mail. I use a body shop upstate to do the post-fabrication work. The bondwork, the sanding and spraying. I paint them specific car colors: Tor-red. Panther Pink. Grass Green. Lemon Twist. Plum Crazy. Vitamin C. Hugger Orange. I order certain models: Shelbys, Challengers, Chargers.1\nAs reproductions, the hoods Prince chose to work with can be seen in relation to his longstanding strategy of appropriation. Though he initially outsourced the spray painting of the hoods to body shops in order to give them an authentically slick finish, he eventually started painting them himself. Using a loose and gestural style, he transformed them into abstractions that bore little resemblance to the original hoods on which they were based. Mounted on the wall, as reliefs, or placed on pedestals as freestanding sculptures, the Hoods are ghostly, atmospheric, and deeply evocative artifacts.In the early 2000s Prince gutted the interior of a run-down tract house on the outskirts of Rensselaerville, in upstate New York. He created an exhibition space for the Hoods inside the stripped-down structure, which he called Second House (200107), in reference to a Los Angeles bungalow he had appropriated in the early 1990s (First House, 1993). The working-class setting (the house was once used as a hunting camp) was ideal for exhibiting the Hoods, which represent a yearning for a free-and-easy lifestyle unencumbered by obligations to conform or aspire to a bourgeois existence.

    "description": "\nDescription\nMichal Rovner's photographic and video work reflects a geographically untethered sensibility that perhaps results from the artist's practice of dividing her time between Israel and New York. Using subject matter ranging from farmhouses in the Israeli countryside to broadcast images of the Gulf War, she reworks source material in a manner that recalls both the pictorialism of Edward Steichen and the digitized and manipulated imagery of more recent artists working with new photographic technologies. In Rovner's work, figuration and figure-ground relationships are destabilized, as she pushes the boundaries of representational art. Expanding the notion of a photograph as an index of the real, she seeks to create images that extend beyond the physical and temporal specificity of what is registered by the camera's lens. She instead searches for a more universal sense of truth while exploring notions of selfhood and autonomy. For Rovner it is critical that her point of departure be rooted in the empirical reality before the camera. She brings her own reflections and inflections to the image, reworking it in her studio until it functions as a document of a processher own response to the initial subject matter and her creative activityas opposed to a single moment in time.For the series One-Person Game Against Nature I (1992), Rovner photographed a group of figures floating in the Red Sea in the dim light of dusk. Shooting from a high angle to eliminate the horizon line, she made two sets of images: one with a Polaroid SX-70 camera, the other with a video camera. Rovner then digitally manipulated the images and altered the color during the processing, so that the bodies would appear to hover in amorphous states. Details and context are thus eliminated from the resulting work, and the haunting, resonant imagery that emerges is suggestive of spiritual and metaphoric states. The series also takes as a conceptual conceit ideas from game theory, in which individuals engaged in a competitive situationeconomic, political, military, or otherwisedetermine an optimal strategy based on the assumed goals, actions, and reactions of the other participants. Here nature itself, or perhaps the human condition, is the challenger.A more recent work, China (1995), is a suite of four highly evocative, blurred photographic images tinted a deep crimson, suggesting the merest hint of back- and foreground. The middle ground is occupied by a line formation of figures slowly marching forward. While Rovner visited China in 1995 and gave the suite a geographic title, these images nonetheless suggests a more ambiguous, almost cosmological setting, one of struggle as the figures press on in their journey, their blurred movements barely captured.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nSince the late 1970s, Cindy Sherman has been engaged in a body of photographic work that confronts the assumptions of various representational formats, from cinema and television to fashion photography to history painting. Her Untitled Film Stills (197780) are now canonical. These 69 black-and-white photographs depict the artist posed in various melodramatic guises that recall the stereotypical feminine characters presented in publicity stills for B movies of the 1950s and 1960s. Building on this exploration of artifice and identity, Sherman turned to the tropes of Surrealist photography in her Disasters series (198689), which investigates the intersection of the sexual and the grotesque. Untitled, #167 (1986) depicts the scene of a gruesome crime. Emerging from the dirt are the nose, lips, and red-painted fingertips of a blonde, apparently female, victim. A discarded Polaroid photographic sheath suggests documentationperhaps by a police officer or the perpetrator, whose reflection appears in an open makeup compactand obliquely implicates the artist as photographic voyeur. This work foreshadows Shermans use of prosthetic body parts, as well as the gradual elimination of her own likeness, in her unnerving and sometimes hilarious Sex Pictures (1992). The figure in Untitled, #264 (1992) has an anatomy of pure plastic. Her coquettish pose, that of centerfold pinup, is complicated by the forbidding gas mask she wears. Here, Sherman is no doubt contemplating the artifice, absurdities, and occasional violence of pornography.\nJennifer Blessing\n",

Though his work has had a tremendous impact on the studied casualness of much recent fashion photography, Tillmans is not a \"fashion photographer.\" If anything he is a portraitist who often photographs his friendswho appear alternately tough, vulnerable, loving, ferocious, gay, and straightin intimate situations.

    "description": "\nDescription\nSherrie Levine emerged in the late 1970s as a member of a group of Conceptual artists known as the Pictures generation, a name derived from the seminal exhibition organized by Douglas Crimp for Artists Space in 1977. Immersed in the prevailing currents of critical theory, these artists used appropriation-based techniques to interrogate the assumptions surrounding visual representation. Whereas many of her contemporaries drew from the image bank of everyday life and the mass media, Levines best-known work finds a more rarified source in the annals of 20th-century art, appropriating from such modernist luminaries as Constantin Brancusi, Marcel Duchamp, Walker Evans, Gustav Klimt, Piet Mondrian, and Man Ray. After Rodchenko: 1-12 comprises twelve facsimiles of the work of the Russian Constructivist, whose celebrated photographs dating from the 1920s and 30s reflect both his interest in graphic abstraction and a fiercely communist ideology. The performative nature of Levines practice, in which she assumes, or impersonates, the identity of an artistic predecessor, has been interpreted by feminist critics as a subversive intervention in the rigid (and overwhelmingly male) construction of the art-historical canon. Levine, however, prefers to view her work as a regenerative act of collaboration, transforming the singular masterpiece into something fluid and perpetually renewable.Katherine Brinson\n",

Regardless of mediumwhether sculpture, paper relief, graphic work, drawing, or muralChillidas works are physical meditations on the qualities and limitations of space.\nChillida introduced iron and steel into his practice on his return to the Basque country, after having worked with plaster and stone in Paris from 1948 to 1951. The apotheosis of hardness and inflexibility, iron is steeped in the Basque regions traditions in industry, architecture, and agriculture, and recalls its landscape and quality of light, which Chillida referred to as black light. This term was inspired by the darker light of the Bay of Biscay, after contemplating the embodiment of the bright white light of the Mediterranean in its classical marble structures.  Constructed solely of steel, Advice to Space V (1993) investigates differing experiences and interpretations of infinite space and depth. This piece combines an organic, sculptural quality with a lightness that is unique to Chillidas steel works. Transforming his ideas about space into abstract material form, Chillida realizes explorations of density, scale, and rhythm.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nFollowing in the footsteps of Marcel Duchamp and his urinal-turned-sculpture, Wim Delvoye has reinvigorated the age-old debate on what constitutes art. Delvoye attempts to democratize art, questioning notions of elitism, as well as forging unexpected links between popular traditions and social issues. The artist is perhaps best known for his provocative installation Cloaca, of which several versions exist since 2000. An elaborate man-made machine that replicates the human digestive system from ingestion through excretion, Cloaca features natural bodily functions that are propelled from the private to the public sphere in a direct challenge to the tacit protocols of the art world. Delvoyes earlier work from the 1980s and 1990s is largely based on paradox and playfully blending old-world motifs with more accessible, contemporary subjects. In the Gothic works, for instance, the Cor-Ten steel bodies of life-size construction equipment (a familiar sight to New Yorkers) are superimposed with a Gothic filigree. Each objects intrinsic role as a secular, utilitarian icon gives way to the divine associations of a medieval cathedral. The same holds true for Delvoyes Gas Canisterscommonplace butane gas containers painted in the style of Delft porcelainand Concrete Mixer (Wedgewood III), which is ornamented with the signature pattern of Wedgewood china and intricately carved in wood. The latters combination of functionality and decoration, modern-day technology and traditional craftsmanship is just as the 18th-century ceramicist Josiah Wedgewood would have intended.Megan Fontanella\n",

These mesmerizing and often inscrutable works, which are frequently placed outside traditional museum spaces, deploy unconventional materials as a way to elicit sensory responses and to obliquely reference historical and cultural meanings derived from the artist's studies of a particular site. Her repertoire of materials has included several tons of horsehair, thousands of honey-coated pennies, beetle-infested turkey carcasses, and thousands of human and animal teeth. Often a lone individual intently engaged in a repetitive taskburning words from a book, wringing his or her hands in honey, or unraveling a length of fabricinhabits her environments, lending the intimacy of human touch. Hamilton thus translates intellectual and social constructs into corporeal impulses, building up a collage of metaphors that allude to experience, memory, and desire and mine the intersection between the individual body and the social body.\nIn her installation (between taxonomy and communion) (1990/96), Hamilton deepens her explorations of the human body through language and its related structures of classification such as taxonomy, the scientific system of categorization used to define and understand the animal kingdom. The work consists of approximately 14,000 human and animal teethwhich Hamilton obtained from dentists, taxidermists, oral surgeons, slaughterhouses, and friends and associateslaid in rows across a steel table covered in a layer of iron oxide powder suggestive of blood. The red surface both foregrounds and threatens to soil the teeth, and it underscores the violence visited upon human and animal alike in the pursuit of knowledge.\nAs if in a laboratory, viewers are encouraged to approach and inspect the specimens displayed in orderly rows on the table. The arrangement of the teeth according to size and appearance rather than species upends the expectation that the work is principally about the difference between animals and humans. In fact, the commingling or unification of the two, manifest in the span of intermixed teeth set against the red background, produces a striking abstract composition that refers to the interconnectedness of our two worlds. As Hamilton has noted, a key aspect of the work is the acknowledgment \"of a relationship to animals that allows their otherness, that falls between the distancing of species identification and the longing in us that is animal.\"1\nAs metonyms for the mouths from which they were extracted, the teeth allude to the bodily functions enacted by the mouth such as eating and biting as well as to its role in articulating meaning through sounds and speech. While the animals and humans represented here remain anonymous, their unique teeth nonetheless stand in for the absent individuals whose distinctive qualities can never be adequately described by taxonomy. Thus for Hamilton (between taxonomy and communion) is fundamentally about the \"predicament of naming,\" the \"gap between language and experience,\" and the \"edge between something that's living and something that's dead.\"\n\r\n1.

In fact, she described herself in a 1994 Los Angeles Times article as a kind of twisted social documentary photographer. Long before earning her MFA at the California Institute of the Arts in 1988, she found that photography was perfectly suited to her drive to describe the world and people around hera drive that unifies all her projects to date, whether focused on gender and sexual identities, notions of community, or the myth of the American dream.Opie's first well-known series, Being and Having (1991), consists of headshots of Opie's female friends sporting false facial hair to suggest the fluidity and complexity of gender. She followed this in the mid-1990s with the Portraits series, in which she photographed transgender women and men, drag queens, and leather dykes with great solemnity and formality, thereby using historical norms of studio portraiture to upend heterosexual norms of identity and sexuality. Although for many viewers these subjects represent the exotic other, Opie's photographs visually resist such simplistic voyeurism through their controlled composition, regal poses, and lush studio backdrops.Throughout her career, Opie has photographed the landscape around her with the same dignity and elegance, capturing the arc of a deserted strip of freeway or the commonplace stretch of a mini-mall in Los Angeles. Each photograph retains the trace of a human presence, suggesting that the space need only be repopulated to serve its purpose, to ward off decay. In 1998, Opie traveled cross-country in her motor home for two months in order to photograph lesbian couples. This series, called Domesticof which Melissa &amp; Lake, Durham, North Carolina is an examplepresents these couples involved in everyday, household activities: relaxing in their backyard, hanging out in their kitchen, playing with their children. There is no sensationalism here. Much like the formal studio portraits before them, these intimate photographs speak both to Opie's identification with her subjects and to the overwhelming absence of such images in mainstream representations.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nSince the early 1990s Catherine Opie has produced a rich, complex photographic oeuvre that explores notions of communal, sexual, and cultural identity. From her early portraits of queer subcultures, pristine urban panoramas, and expansive landscapes to incisive views of her own domestic life, Opie has offered profound insights into the conditions in which communities form and the terms in which they are defined. Throughout her career, self-portraiture has served as a marker of personal and artistic development, as well as a reminder that she, as the photographer, does not stand apart from the groups she documents. In this vein, she made Self-Portrait/Cutting (1993) and Self-Portrait/Pervert (1994) alongside her renowned series portraying fellow members of San Franciscos queer leather subculture. Like those images, her self-portraits address contemporary concerns of queer identity, while couching their content in a formal tradition recalling the sixteenth-century paintings of Hans Holbein. In these images Opie offers something deeply personal, even confessional, revealing powerful longings that are compounded by the great physical vulnerability of the sadomasochistic acts the photographs document. Ten years later, in Self-Portrait/Nursing (2004), Opie returned to the genre, newly suffusing her image with a sense of rapturous contentment, as she holds her infant son in a classically maternal pose that further evokes art-historical imagery. Faintly but clearly visible on her chest, the word pervert still appears as a scar, a trace of her history that carries forward through time.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe 1960s and 1970s witnessed what has been termed the dematerialization of the art object. The prevailing movements of the period favored austere expression; works with an economy of means often focused on the idea or concept rather than the object itself. By contrast, the 1980s were characterized by a return to the traditions of painting and sculpture. Amid this celebration of conservative values, Julian Schnabel played a critical role in the emergence of Neo-Expressionist painting in the U.S. After two decades dominated by the aesthetics of Minimalist and Conceptual art, Schnabel's heroic scale, gestural brushstrokes, and figurative subject matter marked a radical shift in painting.Schnabel came to prominence with his signature plate paintings, such as Spain. The surface of this monumental work is strewn with shards of broken crockery and covered with thick layers of pigment. The series, notable for its heroic scale, flamboyant texture, and distorted subjects, was conceived in the 1970s after Schnabel visited Barcelona, where he saw mosaic benches by Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi. Transforming the traditional surface of the mosaic, the broken plates and cups project from the canvas like jagged, sculptural brushstrokes. The swirling colors of this series often depict legendary figures, and the disembodied head in the center of Spain is an important and recurrent image in the artist's work. Some such figures recall the work of Picasso, but the artist draws from many sources, including El Greco and cultural artifacts from Mexico. The earthy tones of red and ocher and the elongated black shadows that stretch across the canvas clearly evoke the Spanish landscape.In 1987 Schnabel began making paintings in which written words and proper names serve as subject matter. The early works in this series marked a change in imagery from one of excess to one of deliberate austerity and from pictorial narrative to oblique, linguistic reference. In this series, Fakires signals a return to a richer palette and a more layered and expressionistic surface than in his earlier word paintings.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nDiana Thater's installations are hybrids of video, sculpture, and architecture that map cinematic surface onto three-dimensional space. She scales her video projections to the architecture of particular sites and frequently couples them with other videos screened on televisions that are placed sculpturally in the space of the gallery, often on the floor. Her work can be seen as a continuation of first-generation video artists such as Dan Graham and Bruce Nauman, who considered in their work the viewer's movement through space and time and video's potential as an antirepresentational medium. In Thater's case, the viewer's position remains central, but representation and narrative inform her videos, which are often of animals and nature.In the first of the eight separate installations that compose The best animals are the flat animalsthe best space is the deep space (1998), a video monitor sits on the floor in front of a freestanding wall, itself in front of a real wall of the gallery. The monitor, serving as a foreground, displays text, while footage of a zebra performing tricks is projected onto the mid-ground of the freestanding wall and close-ups of the zebra's stripes are projected onto the gallery wall in the background. The piece is a playful examination of the limitations of representation. Each element attempts, and fails, to account for a real animal: a detail (the stripes) stands in for the whole, culture (the trained zebra) for nature, language for material reality. The monitor and walls, when viewed frontally, would seem to mimic a unified pictorial space; yet when viewed from the side, the disparate elements of the installation are pronounced, and the freestanding wall accentuates the flatness and immateriality of the zebra's projected image. Thater's inspiration for this piece was the sequence in Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland in which Alice encounters three-dimensional animals that morph into two-dimensional playing cards.Much of Thater's work engages with how the natural world is often experienced by people: flattened by the camera and at a great spatial and temporal remove. Late and Soon, Occident Trotting (1993, titled after Eadweard Muybridge's nineteenth-century photographs of a horse in motion) explores the landscape as one experiences it in the body and as a memory. Here, a projector is set out of register so that the image is broken into the three primary colors of video: red, blue, and green. Three additional projectors, each with only one lens of either red, blue, or green, are installed in an attempt to reconstruct the same image that has been broken down by the single projector. The imagery plays forward and then backward, further disorienting the viewer. Thaters interest is not in the stationary observer who reconstructs the horse's movement from the isolated frozen moments, but rather in the viewer who moves through a landscape in which nothing is stationary.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWolfgang Tillmans's photographs of friends, dance raves, clubs, and night life have appeared regularly in London's i-D magazine and other publications since 1989. Though his work has had a tremendous impact on the studied casualness of much recent fashion photography, Tillmans is not a \"fashion photographer.\" If anything he is a portraitist who often photographs his friendswho appear alternately tough, vulnerable, loving, ferocious, gay, and straightin intimate situations. Though these probing images reflect his own subjective experiences, they also operate on a more general level, recording a specific dimension of our contemporary culture. Tillmans establishes a collaborative process with his models, whom he calls \"accomplices.\" Thus the informal look of the works belies their choreographed construction. Landscape and still-life images also play a crucial role in his oeuvre, in which half-eaten fruit, sewer rats, crumpled clothing, or urban skylines are photographed with the same dignity and attention to beauty as his human subjects. Traditional subject genres are questioned; crumpled clothing might suggest a figure or landscape, while city scenes seen from the air resemble a still life of objects.For Tillmans, the images are only half the work; the installation or layout constitutes its completion. He affixes his prints directly to the wall with pins or tape, juxtaposing old and new images of varying sizes and mediums. He eschews standard darkroom procedures, blurring the lines between color and black and white (printing black-and-white images on color paper, for instance). Color photographs are placed next to inkjet prints and next to postcards and magazine clippings of his own images, contesting conventional hierarchies of scale and subject matter while drawing focus to the materiality of the photographic medium all within a carefully composed environment that seems to disdain permanency.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThrough his animated films, theatrical productions, and graphic work, William Kentridge addresses the personal and social traumas that are the vestiges of South African apartheid. His ongoing series of short animated films Drawings for Projection (begun in 1989) feature two principal characters, who function as the artist's alter egos: Soho Eckstein, an avaricious South African mining magnate in a pinstriped suit and tie, and Felix Teitlebaum, shown naked and vulnerable to apartheid's devastating acts.In Felix in Exile, the fifth film of the series made between September 1993 and February 1994, Kentridge depicts the barren East Rand landscape as witness to the exploitation of and violence against both natural and human resources. Isolated in a hotel room, Felix peruses the survey charts of Nandi, a young black woman who maps the history of the terrain. Figures and structures are subsumed into the landscape or night sky, allegories for how the land can bear the scars of crimes against humanity.Kentridge created the sixth film History of the Main Complaint in 1996 during the initial hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, at which apartheid's crimes were first publicly admitted while the perpetrators were granted indemnity in the hope of healing profound social and historical wounds in this post-apartheid society. In the film Soho lies comatose in a hospital ward, suffering from the weight of his past acts as well as those for which he is implicated due to his race and class. MRIs and CAT scans reveal his affliction, as memories of violence committed against black South Africans float across the screen. The relationship between individual and collective guilt is played out when Soho regains consciousness only through acknowledging his own responsibility.Kentridge's films reveal traces of their making, just as the narratives invoke memories of an historic time. For each scene, Kentridge films a large charcoal and pastel drawing (measuring approximately 76.2 x 114.3 cm), which he partially erases and redraws, recording each sheet up to 500 times. The cumulative effect of his thought process is retained, leaving residue of the act of production to reflect the tensions between past and present.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIt is necessary to understand Truong Tans reputation for avant-gardism in relation to a development of mainstream social and aesthetic practices in Vietnam that was influenced by 19th-century French colonization, the early 20th-century establishment of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts de LIndochine, and the negotiations that the Vietnamese people undertook in order to regain their independence. Modern Vietnamese painting, influenced by French aesthetics, favored the portrayal of lush local landscapes, and a lyrical idyll represented in the form of the feminine figure, in a visual style termed realite poetique (poetic reality). Post-independence aesthetics would increasingly challenge these passive and idealized visions, and intensify as the country underwent the oi Moi economic reforms of the mid-1980s. A 1989 graduate of Hanoi Fine Arts University, Truong Tan became part of a wave of aesthetic exploration that challenged assumptions about arts form and meaning, his practice causing controversy with its confrontation of taboo sexual themes.\nAn openly homosexual artist living in an increasingly liberalized but still conservative environment, Truong Tan developed a practice that was designated as unorthodox, a framing that served to both publicize and censure his work. The categorization has also tended to obscure his works idealistic and poetic nuances. In What Do We Want (199394), a male figure, his face shown in the profile view that recurs throughout the artists oeuvre, lies vulnerable and naked across the canvas, apparently crucified. The male figures idealization may be seen in relation to the idealized feminine figure celebrated in the earlier French-influenced Vietnamese aesthetic. Truong Tans idealization however is double-edged, as the figure, his face averted in a seemingly nonconfrontational stance, calls attention to a hidden side. This ironic pairing of diplomatic concession with a critique of rigid conservatism was apparent in Cultural Collision, an exhibition that Truong Tan participated in along with American artist Bradford Edwards at Red River Gallery in Hanoi in 1995. On this occasion, twelve of Truong Tans paintings were censored. In response the artist replaced these censured works with rice-paper paintings inscribed with the deferential response Excuse Me in Vietnamese, English, and French.\nCharacterized by simplicity of material, line, and color, and by a synthetic composition in which form is flattened and contour simplified, Truong Tans work has a powerful rawness that underscores his struggle to uncover the basic truths of power, society, and life. A rope, symbolizing social and aesthetic stricture, is wrapped around the middle of What Do We Want. It acts as a constraining device, but also is a nod to modesty. As in his 1994 performance in which the artist, his body wrapped in a sheet and bound by rope, signals a refusal of social, cultural, and sexual limits by stepping out of physical ones, the bound painting is poised between restraint and liberation. What Do We Want is thus less a confrontation than it is an appeal for a more measured reflection on the imposition of constraints. In another performance, Buffalo, staged in the village of Moc Chau in 1996, the artist shoulders a 40-kilogram plough and attempts to plough a field. The weight of the plough finally defeats him and he collapses, yet the artists courageous effort and unrelenting desire to transform an indifferent cultural landscape has not gone unnoticed, its simple yet effective gesture leaving an indelible mark.\nJune Yap\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nJanine Antoni has crafted her personal aesthetic out of everyday activities and the objects that surround them. In particular she focuses on the rituals of the body, such as eating, sleeping, and bathing, as well as what would once have been called \"women's work,\" such as mopping and weaving. A polyglot when it comes to mediums, Antoni has created sculptures, videos, photographs, and paintings, but the unifying substrate in her work has always been her body and the actions and contexts that encode it. In an early piece entitled Loving Care (1992), Antoni crept across a gallery on her hands and knees, dipping her long hair in a bucket of hair dye and painting the floor with it. Her most notorious piece, Gnaw (1992), involved carving two large cubes of chocolate and lard with her teeth and casting lipsticks and heart-shaped boxes from the spit-out remnants. For Lick and Lather (199394), the artist cast self-portrait busts in chocolate and soap, licking the former and washing with the latter until they resembled mere ghosts of her image.Not all of Antoni's projects have involved such visceral materials and acts. Two photographic works have used her parents as sculptural material. In Mom and Dad (1994), Antoni made up each of her parents in the guise of the other, photographing them together in three different permutations with either one or both of them costumed in this way; Momme (1995) shows her mother sitting on a sofa, with the artist's foot peeking out of her dress, as if in some regressive fantasy. These pieces epitomize the darkly fantastic humor that pervades much of Antoni's work. She simultaneously sanctifies and satirizes, as when she upended the typical image of the nurturing mother with child in the photographs Coddle (1999) and 2038 (2000) by replacing the child with her own leg and a cow, respectively. Antoni's emphasis on her own body imbues her work with an air of autoeroticism or even narcissism but also harkens to the importance of autobiography in much 1970s feminist art. In staging a kind of return to that era, Antoni borrows much of its energy; by infusing that power into the banal rituals of the everyday, she shows just how deeply gendered they still are.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn his 1979 article \"Transcendent Anti-Fetishism,\" Ross Bleckner called for an art of the \"psychologized object\" that would connect with a \"larger psychological, social, and political reality.\" The desire to reexamine the allegorical and metaphorical dimensions of art that arose among artists in the late 1970s was a response to the primacy of formal and perceptual issues at this time and the heated denial of content in critical writing about Minimalism. These issues were also central to the 1980s revival of painting, of which Bleckner was a significant figure, providing a model for other artists developing conceptually based work. He made canvases that bridge the gap between the transcendental ideals of high Modernist abstraction and Minimalism's assertion of the picture plane as a strictly material surface. In his attempt to revive painting after its critically pronounced death, Bleckner rehabilitated the debased style of Op art, softening the authority of its hard edges in his early 1980s stripe paintings.In 1984 Bleckner began a body of work incorporating ghostly semitransparent imagery set against dark, spatially illusionistic fields. Through a proliferation of floating urnlike vessels, trophies, garlands, and flowers, the artist created a morbid fin-de-siecle dream space. The memorial symbols in these works have been widely perceived as a response to the AIDS epidemic and its profound impact on the art world. Bleckner's subsequent motifs are even more elegiac and directly related to the ravages of AIDSstarry skies; the architecture of basilicas; markings resembling Kaposi's sarcoma and immunodeficient cells; and a constant suggestion of a glowing, otherworldly light.Throbbing Hearts (1994) maintains the melancholy quality of all Bleckner's work. The passages of luminous red pigment floating on a silvery gray field suggest the pulsing hearts of the painting's title. Like other iconic forms in the artist's work, the hearttraditionally considered the bodily seat of love and faithis richly evocative. Bleckner's hearts may be considered metonymic allusions to individual beings. \"I have always thought of painting as skin, in a sense holding things back, 'in place,' existing tensely over that that it represses,\" Bleckner said in a 1988 interview. \"The painter then X-rays parts that the skin covers and uncovers them. The metaphor is obviously figurative (skin protecting the fragility of that that it conceals) but I want the result to be abstract: it transforms itself in the making from the idea of an organ (like a throbbing close to the chest) into an idea about just throbbing.\"1Jennifer Blessing1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nSince the late 1960s, Christian Boltanski has worked with photographs collected from ordinary and often ephemeral sources, endowing the commonplace with significance. Boltanski seeks to create an art that is indistinguishable from life and has said, \"The fascinating moment for me is when the spectator hasn't registered the art connection, and the longer I can delay this association the better.\"1 By appropriating mementos of other people's lives and placing them in an art context, Boltanski explores the power of photography to transcend individual identity and to function instead as a witness to collective rituals and shared cultural memories.At once personal and universal in reference, Humans (1994) is one of several large-scale works by Boltanski that serves as a monument to the dead, hinting at the Holocaust without naming it explicitly. Through its size and tone, the work evokes the contemplative atmosphere of a small theater or a space for religious observance. The installation consists of more than 1,200 images that the artist rephotographed from sources he has previously used: school portraits, family photographs, newspaper pictures, and police registries. Simultaneously illuminated and obfuscated by dangling lightbulbs, the arrangement of snapshots provides no context to identify or connect the unnamed individuals, to distinguish the living from the dead or victim from criminal. Each of these traces of human life has been reduced to a uniform size to obscure distinguishing features and to suggest the equality of the group. The collection of images is installed at random, thereby prohibiting the implication of a singular narrative. Within this haunting environment, Boltanski intermingles emotion and history, juxtaposing innocence and guilt, truth and deception, sentimentality and profundity.1. As quoted by Arthur Danto, \"Christian Boltanski,\" The Nation, February 13, 1989 (reproduced in Arthor Danto, Encounters &amp; Reflections: Art in the Historical Present, University of California Press, 1997: p. 263).\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nJames Casebere photographs the buildings that structure our social fabric, not during on-site visits to architectural structures, but rather from tabletop models he fabricates in his studio. These models, made from such featureless materials as Foamcore, museum board, plaster, and Styrofoam, remain empty of detail and human figures. It is only when Casebere casts highly nuanced light on their bland surfaces and spartan interiors that the models are transformed. Photographed in this way, his images suggest the psychologically charged spaces of the institutions that organize and control society.During the 1970s Casebere was captivated by the social and cultural impact of film, television, and architecture. In particular, Robert Venturi's articulation of architecture as a system of signs evoked for Casebere the notion that a community is defined by its structures, both those that are highly visible, such as factories and churches, and those tucked out of sight, such as prisons and asylums. By the time he received his MFA from the California Institute of the Arts in 1979, he was staging his photographs to construct realities inspired by contemporary American visual culture. Like David Levinthal, Richard Prince, Cindy Sherman, Laurie Simmons, and others of their generation, Casebere challenged the commonly held perception of photography as a direct corollary to truth and reality.Casebere is intent on blurring the line between fiction and fact, between myth and reality, in both his architectural models and his photographs of them. For example, in Asylum (1994) the space suggests the mechanism of photography itself: the prison cell is the box of the camera and the window acts as the aperture, letting in light. Casebere continually explores the mythologies that surround particular institutions, as well as the broader implications of dominant systems, such as commerce, labor, religion, health, and law. Here, he elicits ideas associated with asylums, ranging from the political to the spiritual; the room evokes a feeling of isolated incarceration as much as it does one of solitary transcendence, revealing the degree to which architecture and place exert their power on human behavior.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMiles Coolidge's photographs of suburban and industrial landscapes are impassive portraits of contemporary alienation. His works, among them Industrial Buildings and Police Station, Kids-R-Us, McDonald's (both 1994) from his Safetyville series (199495), document banal spaces where the possibility of human existence has nearly been evacuated. At first glance the twenty color prints of Safetyville seem to depict views of an anonymous, suburban town in America. Upon closer inspection, however, the details become less plausible and the scenes less convincingly real. Safetyville is, in fact, only a model, a miniature town built at one-third scale in Sacramento, California, and designed to teach children about pedestrian safety. The flatness of Coolidge's images of the site further underscores the distorted logic of the child-sized buildings, which are mere facades like structures on a movie set. In part a commentary on rampant American consumerism, the images draw attention to the corporate logos adorning the buildings. Those brand names, such as McDonald's and Procter and Gamble, become markers of identification and comfort.In his more recent series, Mattawa (2000), addressing a housing development for migrant farm workers in Washington state, Coolidge pushes the social critique of Safetyville even further. Mattawa #9, one work from this series of fourteen photographs, depicts rows of shipping containers that have been converted into worker dwellings. The narrow form of the containers stand in stark contrast to the mountains and fields that lie beyond their cold, geometric confines. Ironically, the workers are dehumanized as they are forced to inhabit the containers in which the fruits of their labor are transported. In both Safetyville and Mattawa, signifiers of daily life and human use, such as weathered facades, tattered signs, and cracked pavement, are mingled with an uncanny sense of absence. Employing an unlikely pairing, Coolidge fuses social commentary with a flat, formalist aesthetic.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nInitially trained as a filmmaker, Tracey Moffatt has shifted back and forth between moving pictures and still photography since the late 1980s. With each new series, she has adjusted her style and technique, producing a diverse body of work that ranges from surreal fantasies to ersatz documentary reportage, from videos and photographs saturated with exaggerated color to grainy black-and-white photogravures. An interest in artifice unites her multiform production. Like a number of artists of her generation, Moffatt rejects transcribing reality in favor of constructing her own, alternative reality. She has been highly receptive to the strategies of popular cultureto cinema, television, magazines, and advertising.Many of Moffatt's works address themes relating to her native Australia, particularly race relations between Aborigines and whites. In Night Cries: A Rural Tradegy (1989), the first film that won her widespread attention, Moffatt focused on the complex relationship between an adult Aboriginal woman and her dying white foster mother. This piece refers to Australia's \"stolen generation\"the thousands of Aboriginal children who were removed from their families and placed into white households up through the 1960sand is partly rooted in Moffatt's own childhood experience; half-Aboriginal, she was herself raised by a white foster family in Brisbane. But Moffatt rejects autobiographical readings of her work as reductive. Her work engages larger, more universal themes of race, sexuality, identity, and family.Scarred for Life (1994) one of Moffatt's best-known series, comprises nine images featuring children or adolescents, both Aboriginal and white, in suburban settings. Each image records a different trauma inflicted by parents or by older siblings, from verbal to physical abuse. The individuals pictured are actors, selected and arranged by the artist, but Moffatt places them within a documentary format: the staged tableaux, which are printed as photolithographs in muted colors on cream paper and accompanied by short, neutral captions, simulate pages of Life magazine from the 1960s. This deadpan journalistic presentation is jarringly at odds with the deeply intimate, often painful subject matter. At the same time, the images have an informal, snapshot appearance and cover a broad range of past dates (from 1956 to 1977) as if they were pages from a family photo album. A series of deliberately ambiguous and open-ended mini-narratives, Scarred for Life evokes the fragmented nature of memory and, as implied in the title, the way in which injuries from our childhood years remain with us throughout our adult lives.Ted Mann\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nCatherine Opie counts such documentary photographers as Eugene Atget, August Sander, Berenice Abbott, Walker Evans, Lewis Hine, and Dorothea Lange among her greatest historical influences. In fact, she described herself in a 1994 Los Angeles Times article as a kind of twisted social documentary photographer. Long before earning her MFA at the California Institute of the Arts in 1988, she found that photography was perfectly suited to her drive to describe the world and people around hera drive that unifies all her projects to date, whether focused on gender and sexual identities, notions of community, or the myth of the American dream.Opie's first well-known series, Being and Having (1991), consists of headshots of Opie's female friends sporting false facial hair to suggest the fluidity and complexity of gender. She followed this in the mid-1990s with the Portraits series, in which she photographed transgender women and men, drag queens, and leather dykes with great solemnity and formality, thereby using historical norms of studio portraiture to upend heterosexual norms of identity and sexuality. Although for many viewers these subjects represent the exotic other, Opie's photographs visually resist such simplistic voyeurism through their controlled composition, regal poses, and lush studio backdrops.Throughout her career, Opie has photographed the landscape around her with the same dignity and elegance, capturing the arc of a deserted strip of freeway or the commonplace stretch of a mini-mall in Los Angeles. Each photograph retains the trace of a human presence, suggesting that the space need only be repopulated to serve its purpose, to ward off decay. In 1998, Opie traveled cross-country in her motor home for two months in order to photograph lesbian couples. This series, called Domesticof which Melissa &amp; Lake, Durham, North Carolina is an examplepresents these couples involved in everyday, household activities: relaxing in their backyard, hanging out in their kitchen, playing with their children. There is no sensationalism here. Much like the formal studio portraits before them, these intimate photographs speak both to Opie's identification with her subjects and to the overwhelming absence of such images in mainstream representations.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nGabriel Orozco's multimedia works are philosophical investigations of form, medium, and installation. In his own exhibitions, he often employs sculpture, drawing, photography, installation, and video and recycles older work into sometimes new mediums and contexts. The readymade is central to Orozco's process. He frequently manipulates what he discovers by arranging found materials (a deflated soccer ball, cans of cat food, simple planks of wood) and photographing his constructions. Sometimes he transforms the ordinary just by suggesting a form in a seemingly banal image, as in Pulpo (Octopus, 1991), which bestows meaning on a tangle of pipes. Here the readymade is not so much a thing found as a dynamic and poetic interaction between artist and object.Orozco plays photography and sculpture off against one another to create compelling hybrids in the service of his interest in the lightening of mass. This involves streamlining or hollowing out objects that at first appear heavy and cumbersome, as in the sculpture La DS (1993, pronounced like la deesse, French for goddess), a trisected Citroen automobile seamlessly reassembled without the middle section. In Dos Parejas (Two Couples, 1990), heavy industrial objects are playfully anthropomorphized by their title as their sculptural mass is negated through photographic reproduction. In Photogravity (1999), Orozco mounted large versions of his old photographs on spindly legs to produce a sort of two-dimensional sculpture. He uses one medium to expose another's limits: photography can strip sculpture of its mass, but it always lacks the real thing that it pictures.Orozco's photographs document chance encounters with sites and objects in his native Mexico and other locations around the world, including Brazil, Germany, Iceland, India, and New York. Im looking for different kinds of contexts . . . I want to make something in a very clean, white space. Then I want to get outside . . . I grew up in museums, but I also grew up in the streets. Acutely attentive to the various receptions his work engenders in different locations, he seeks to make his viewers aware of their own cultural boundedness. His work ultimately promotes deterritorialization, within which a multiplicity of viewpoints is recognized and none can take precedence. Pelota en agua (Ball on Water, 1994) first appears to be a photograph of a cloud-streaked sky, but turns out to be a reflection captured in a puddle, evidenced by a half-submerged ball. This conflation of sky and earth, lofty and lowly, is emblematic of Orozco's attempt to bridge the distance between oppositional themes and sites.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the early 1990s, Zhang Huan and a group of performance artists set up studios in Dashancun Village, a poor suburb of eastern Beijing used as the city's dumping ground, and renamed the area the Beijing East Village after New York's downtown neighborhood that was the center of 1980s vanguard art. Antagonistic toward commercial artists who were settled in Yuanmingyuan, an affluent western section of the city, the collective participated in private performances deemed dangerous and subversive by Chinese officials and institutions. Zhang's early Body Experiments, part of this post-Tiananmen, avant-garde movement, explore themes of existentialism and corporeality. By using his body as the site of representation, Zhang's performances, documented through photographs, illustrate the artist's belief in the ultimate relief or transcendence that can be achieved through endurance. Among these abject yet lyrical performances, 12 Square Meters was a breakthrough work. Commenting on the squalid living conditions in Dashancun, Zhang entered a public latrine in the height of summer and proceeded to sit naked on a backless iron stool in the center of the room (measuring twelve square meters). This photograph shows the artist in a state of heightened awareness, his body covered with swarms of flies as they settle and feast on honey and fish oil. After an hour, Zhang walked toward an abandoned fishing pond and slowly immersed himself in the water, allowing the struggling flies to perish.Sandhini Poddar\n",

The cycle unfolds not only cinematically but also through the photographs, drawings, sculptures, and installations the artist produced in conjunction with each episode. Its conceptual departure point is the male cremaster muscle, which controls testicular contractions in response to external stimuli. The project is rife with anatomical allusions to the position of the reproductive organs during the embryonic process of sexual differentiation, repeatedly returning to moments in which the outcome is still unknown. In Barneys metaphoric universe, these instances represent pure potential. As the cycle evolved over eight years, Barney looked beyond biology as a way to explore the creation of form, employing narrative models from other realms, such as biography, mythology, and geology. The vitrines and photographs on view here reference these varied sources, incorporating key objects, symbols, and color schemes to suggest the core themes of each film in the cycle.\nDaylong screenings of all five CREMASTER films will be held in the museums Peter B.

    "description": "\nDescription\nSince the beginning of her career in Belgrade during the early 1970s, Marina Abramovic has pioneered the use of performance as a visual art form. The body has always been both her subject and medium. Exploring the physical and mental limits of her being, she has withstood pain, exhaustion, and danger in the quest for emotional and spiritual transformation. This particular blend of epic struggle and self-inflicted violence was borne out of the contradictions of her childhood: both parents were high-ranking officials in the socialist government, while her grandmother, with whom she had lived, was devoutly Serbian Orthodox. Though personal in origin, the explosive force of Abramovic's art spoke to a generation in Yugoslavia undergoing the tightening control of communist rule.The tensions between abandonment and control are at the heart of her series of performances known as Rhythms (197374). In Rhythm 5 (1974), Abramovic lay down inside the blazing frame of a wooden star. With her oxygen supply depleted by the fire, she lost consciousness and had to be rescued by concerned onlookers. In Rhythm 10 (1973), she plunged a knife between the spread fingers of one hand, stopping only after she had cut herself 20 times. Having made an audio recording of the action, she then played back the sound while repeating the movementsthis time trying to coordinate the new gashes with the old. Using her dialogue with an audience as a source of energy, Abramovic created ritualistic performance pieces that were cathartic and liberating. In Rhythm 0 (1974), she invited audience members to do whatever they wanted to her using any of the 72 items she provided: pen, scissors, chains, axe, loaded pistol, and others. This essay in submission was played out to chilling conclusionsthe performance ceased when audience members grew too aggressive. Truly ephemeral, Abramovic's earliest performances were documented only by crude black-and-white photographs and descriptive texts, which she published as an edition years later, choosing the most iconic images to represent the essence of her actions. Since 1976 she has utilized video to capture the temporal nature of her art. Cleaning the Mirror #1 (1995) is composed of five stacked monitors playing videos of a haunting performance in which Abramovic scrubs a grime-covered human skeleton on her lap. Rich with metaphor, this three-hour action recalls, among other things, Tibetan death rites that prepare disciples to become one with their own mortality.Nancy Spector\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nUsing flimsy materials such as paper or cardboard, Thomas Demand constructs life-size models of architectural spaces in which events of historic or popular significance have taken place. He then photographs the models to re-create the image that he originally selected from the Internet or newspaper. His work thus engages formal intersections between photography, sculpture, and architecture while commenting on the power of both space and the photographic image to affect public consciousness saturated by mass media. I like to imagine the sum of all the media representations of the event as a kind of landscape, he says, and the media industry as the tour bus company that takes us through these colorful surrounds. Key for Demand is that the original event, with its real context, is utterly absent from his photograph; there is not the slightest trace. It is only the deceived eye of the viewer that might make the association. Implicit here is a critique of the assumption that the photograph is a guarantor of truth.Representative of mass media's tendencies, many of the stories Demand chooses are violent or linked to grim situations. Corridor (1995) depicts the hallway leading to serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer's apartment; Office (1996) reconstructs the East Berlin headquarters of the Stasi secret police. These images lack any sort of human presence as well as the horrible, visceral evidence that would have accompanied actual events in such places. Instead, they might be said to speak to Hannah Arendt's banality of evil, the notion that evil may persist best when perceived as ordinary by its perpetrators. These silent, unexceptional spaces thus take on a sinister edge. They are uncannyfamiliar to everyone, yet occlusive of darker forces beneath their cleansed surfaces. In Archive (1995), the reconstruction of Nazi propagandist and filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl's personal inventory is strangely lit, the boxes suspiciously generic and unlabeled. Demand has here, as he does in many works, left clues to his image's artificiality. The resolute blankness of the scene is a reminder of our distance from the actual place and events referenced and the photographs unsettling ability to replace memory, to supplant the real, particularly for history that entire societies experience. Things enter reality through photography, Demand declares. Tourists dont know theyve seen the sights until they can match their experiences to picture postcards.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nStan Douglas utilizes forms of popular entertainmentcinema and televisionto destabilize narratives that depict society as a unified, homogeneous front with one history, one set of desires, and one value system. Whether emulating the evening news during the 1968 race riots or restaging a scene from Alfred Hitchcocks Marnie, Douglas disrupts representational systems by introducing unsettling elements of difference. Issues of race and class infiltrate his entire project.Douglass Monodramas, ten 30- to 60-second videos conceived as interventions into commercial television, interrupted the usual flow of advertising and entertainment when broadcast nightly in British Columbia for three weeks in 1992. These micronarratives mimic televisions editing techniques, but as kernels of a story they refuse to cohere. They are tales of dysfunction and dislocation, misanthropy and misunderstanding: a car and a school bus nearly collide at an intersection, only to drive away; a pedestrian greets an Afro-Canadian man he encounters on the street but is told in response, Im not Gary. When the videos were aired unannounced during commercial breaks, viewers called the station to inquire about what was being sold, their responses evincing how the media can refocus attention from content to consumption.The film installation Der Sandmann investigates the intersection of history and memory as witnessed against the backdrop of postCold War Germany. Shot on 16mm film in the old Ufa studios near Potsdam, the piece fuses E.T.A. Hoffmanns eponymous tale, Freuds citation of it in The Uncanny, his study of repression and repetition, as well as the social impulses behind 19th-century German urban planning, which instituted the Schrebergarten, plots of leasable land on which the poor could grow their own food. Projected as two separate but intersecting videos showing the garden at different chronological pointsin use during the 1960s and as a construction site some 20 years laterDer Sandmann contemplates temporality and the transformative effects of history.Nutka similarly utilizes image bifurcation, this time to explore the history of colonialization on Vancouver Island, where English and Spanish fleets battled over trade routes in the 18th century. Films of the landscapethe only imagery shownare superimposed on one screen so that the footage appears doubled. This formal effect is echoed by the soundtrack, which includes excerpts from the sea captains diaries, which become increasingly paranoid and irrational.

Conjuring the vocabulary of Minimalism and Post-Minimalism while reinvigorating it with open-ended content, Gonzalez-Torres leaves the construction of meaning to the participation of viewers, only subtly hinting at the autobiographical and incendiary in his untitled works. Conceived shortly before the artist's death, Untitled (Golden) (1995) extends across a space as a luminous curtain, shimmering with faceted tendrils of faux-gilded beads. The gentle confrontation of this golden screen provokes the tactile and sensory, inviting the viewer to transform its shape simply by walking through. This collective and public experience of doing so, however, belies the intimate nature of Gonzalez-Torres's other beaded curtain works, which often reference the organic and inorganic substances associated with battling AIDS.

    "description": "\nDescription\nWith his keen eye for contour, Ellsworth Kelly extracts visual fragments from the surrounding worldthe sweeping curve of a Romanesque nave, a crescent moon, a barred windowand then condenses them into elemental colors and shapes. Although relentlessly abstract, his forms are anchored to the legible, to details of architecture or landscape, filtered through the artists vision. Early in his career, Kelly adopted a philosophy of anti-illusionism that would change the parameters of painting and revise its relationship to sculpture. He began painting monochrome panels in the early 1950s and has been experimenting with this composition (or anticomposition) ever since in single and multipanel formats. With their anonymous, uninflected technique and absence of surface drawing, these pristine painting-objects established a new relationship between painting and its architectural context. By defining the structure and shape of each canvas through colormatte, uniform, and without gestural nuanceKelly eliminated any figure-ground illusion and brought painting into the sculptural realm of objects; the painting itself became the figure, with the wall as its ground.Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red exemplifies Kellys lucid, forthright style. Five monochrome panels are arranged in the order of the chromatic spectrum, the primary colors balanced by their intermediary values of green and orange. The concentrated colors are charged by their interaction with each other, and the works sizemonumental, yet at a human scale by virtue of its breakdown into vertical panelsfurther strengthens its presence. Dark Blue Curve signals Kellys longtime interest in shaped canvases. It is this focus on peripheral shape identified by color that makes his paintings sculptural, engaging directly with their own forms and the walls around them. The shaped monochromes reinforce the anti-illusionistic project begun with Kellys rectangular panels; unframed and unmarked save for their color, they are a more emphatic denial of the window-onto-the-world view of the traditional four-sided easel painting. Wright Curve, a steel sculpture designed for permanent installation in the Guggenheims Peter B. Lewis Theater, is named after the museums architect, Frank Lloyd Wright. Its affinity with the palette and geometry of the auditorium shows the artists interest in encouraging site-specific experiences of his painting and sculpture. For Kelly, the transition between the two mediums is fluid: sculpture for me is something Ive brought off the wall.Bridget Alsdorf\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nDuring the 1980s, Anselm Kiefer became one of the foremost representatives of Neo-Expressionism, an approach characterized by violent, gestural brushwork and a return to the personal. His large-scale works, infused with references to both the German romantic tradition and his countrys political heritage, combine a nearly monochromatic palette with mixed media, including the application of materials such as strips of lead, straw, plaster, seeds, ash, and soil. The result is an oeuvre whose monumental scale and rich interplay of textures heighten the solemnity and transcendental nature of its contents.When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, it seemed that the long period of national mourning might finally be over. Kiefer left Germany, settling first in New York and then in the South of France, without producing any significant works for around three years. After two decades of dealing almost exclusively with the horrors of the Holocaust and Germanys Nazi past, Kiefer began to explore a more universal set of themes, still based on religion, myth, and history, but now focusing on the spirituality of man and the internal workings of the mind. The artists subject matter changed markedly and ranged from the sunflowers of Arles to the queens of France. In a series of works devoted to French female royalty, Kiefer paid homage to the likes of Catherine de Medici, Marie Antoinette, and Anne dAutriche. In Les Reines de France, the women are rendered like Byzantine icons against a background of distressed gold-leaf mosaic. This new iconography, while still engaged with the weight of history, indicates that Kiefer now approached his subject matter with admiration, even joy.The color of leada support for ideas in Kiefers wordsstands out in his painting The Land of the Two Rivers (Zweistromland). This monumental work features an inscription with the names of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, a reference to the Mesopotamian civilization, in whose banks settled some of the most ancient peoples in humankind. Records have gone beyond the decay and ruins of these cultures and have made their past a present in this painting. The Land of the Two Rivers was preceded by a sculpture with the same title where books made of lead conveyed a sense of historys durability.\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nBorn in Germany just months before the final European battle of World War II, Anselm Kiefer grew up witnessing the results of modern warfare and the division of his homeland. He also experienced the rebuilding of a fragmented nation and its struggle for renewal. Kiefer devoted himself to investigating the interwoven patterns of German mythology and history and the way they contributed to the rise of Fascism. He confronted these issues by violating aesthetic taboos and resurrecting sublimated icons. For example, in his 1969 Occupations series, Kiefer photographed himself striking the Sieg Heil pose. Subsequent paintingsimmense landscapes and architectural interiors, often encrusted with sand and strawinvoke Germanys literary and political heritage. References abound to the Nibel-ungen and Wagner, Albert Speers architecture, and Adolf Hitler.Seraphim is part of Kiefers Angel series, which treats the theme of spiritual salvation by fire, an ancient belief perverted by the Nazis in their quest for an exclusively Aryan nation. In this painting, a ladder connects a landscape to the sky. At its base, a serpentsymbolizing a fallen angelrefers to the prevalence of evil on earth. According to the Doctrine of Celestial Hierarchy, a 5th-century text, the seraphim purify through fire and burnt offering. Kiefer used fire to create the surface of Seraphim, and it is evident from this and many other works that he associates fire with the redemptive powers of art. This equivalence was suggested in the 1974 canvas Painting = Burning, in which the outline of a painters palette is superimposed on a view of the war-torn earth. The actual burning of materials used in Seraphim suggests a more specific reading: the Latin word used to describe a sacrificial offering consumed by flames is holocaust.In 1991, the year of Germanys reunification, Kiefer left his homeland to travel the world; he eventually settled in the South of France. This change had a marked effect on the artists style and themes, which ranged from the sunflowers of Arles to the queens of France. In a series of works devoted to French female royalty, Kiefer paid homage to the likes of Catherine de Medici, Marie-Antoinette, and Anne dAutriche.

Soft Shuttlecock was created specifically by the artists for the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed rotunda of the Guggenheim Museum in celebration of Oldenburg's 1995 retrospective. While planning the exhibition, Oldenburg and van Bruggen were also developing a project for the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri, in which four 18-foot-high shuttlecocks in plastic and aluminum are situated in the grass on either side of the museum, as if the building were a badminton net and the birdies fell during play. For the Guggenheim installation, the artists playfully engaged the same object, this time rendering it in more pliant materials.Early preparatory drawings show the shuttlecock transformed into a costume for a tightrope walker to wear while crossing the museum's rotunda. The final result was no less a daring interaction with the space. Oldenburg and van Bruggen draped the flaccid feathers of the shuttlecock over several ramps and suspended others from the skylight above with cables. Like the Nelson-Atkins installation, Soft Shuttlecock humorously deflates the imposing structure of the building by diminishing its relative scale, while underscoring the museum's institutional role as a site not only for culture and education but also for recreation and entertainment.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nGabriel Orozco's multimedia works are philosophical investigations of form, medium, and installation. In his own exhibitions, he often employs sculpture, drawing, photography, installation, and video and recycles older work into sometimes new mediums and contexts. The readymade is central to Orozco's process. He frequently manipulates what he discovers by arranging found materials (a deflated soccer ball, cans of cat food, simple planks of wood) and photographing his constructions. Sometimes he transforms the ordinary just by suggesting a form in a seemingly banal image, as in Pulpo (Octopus, 1991), which bestows meaning on a tangle of pipes. Here the readymade is not so much a thing found as a dynamic and poetic interaction between artist and object.Orozco plays photography and sculpture off against one another to create compelling hybrids in the service of his interest in the lightening of mass. This involves streamlining or hollowing out objects that at first appear heavy and cumbersome, as in the sculpture La DS (1993, pronounced like la deesse, French for goddess), a trisected Citroen automobile seamlessly reassembled without the middle section. In Dos Parejas (Two Couples, 1990), heavy industrial objects are playfully anthropomorphized by their title as their sculptural mass is negated through photographic reproduction. In Photogravity (1999), Orozco mounted large versions of his old photographs on spindly legs to produce a sort of two-dimensional sculpture. He uses one medium to expose another's limits: photography can strip sculpture of its mass, but it always lacks the real thing that it pictures.Orozco's photographs document chance encounters with sites and objects in his native Mexico and other locations around the world, including Brazil, Germany, Iceland, India, and New York. Im looking for different kinds of contexts . . . I want to make something in a very clean, white space. Then I want to get outside . . . I grew up in museums, but I also grew up in the streets. Acutely attentive to the various receptions his work engenders in different locations, he seeks to make his viewers aware of their own cultural boundedness. His work ultimately promotes deterritorialization, within which a multiplicity of viewpoints is recognized and none can take precedence. Pelota en agua (Ball on Water, 1994) first appears to be a photograph of a cloud-streaked sky, but turns out to be a reflection captured in a puddle, evidenced by a half-submerged ball. This conflation of sky and earth, lofty and lowly, is emblematic of Orozco's attempt to bridge the distance between oppositional themes and sites.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMichal Rovner's photographic and video work reflects a geographically untethered sensibility that perhaps results from the artist's practice of dividing her time between Israel and New York. Using subject matter ranging from farmhouses in the Israeli countryside to broadcast images of the Gulf War, she reworks source material in a manner that recalls both the pictorialism of Edward Steichen and the digitized and manipulated imagery of more recent artists working with new photographic technologies. In Rovner's work, figuration and figure-ground relationships are destabilized, as she pushes the boundaries of representational art. Expanding the notion of a photograph as an index of the real, she seeks to create images that extend beyond the physical and temporal specificity of what is registered by the camera's lens. She instead searches for a more universal sense of truth while exploring notions of selfhood and autonomy. For Rovner it is critical that her point of departure be rooted in the empirical reality before the camera. She brings her own reflections and inflections to the image, reworking it in her studio until it functions as a document of a processher own response to the initial subject matter and her creative activityas opposed to a single moment in time.For the series One-Person Game Against Nature I (1992), Rovner photographed a group of figures floating in the Red Sea in the dim light of dusk. Shooting from a high angle to eliminate the horizon line, she made two sets of images: one with a Polaroid SX-70 camera, the other with a video camera. Rovner then digitally manipulated the images and altered the color during the processing, so that the bodies would appear to hover in amorphous states. Details and context are thus eliminated from the resulting work, and the haunting, resonant imagery that emerges is suggestive of spiritual and metaphoric states. The series also takes as a conceptual conceit ideas from game theory, in which individuals engaged in a competitive situationeconomic, political, military, or otherwisedetermine an optimal strategy based on the assumed goals, actions, and reactions of the other participants. Here nature itself, or perhaps the human condition, is the challenger.A more recent work, China (1995), is a suite of four highly evocative, blurred photographic images tinted a deep crimson, suggesting the merest hint of back- and foreground. The middle ground is occupied by a line formation of figures slowly marching forward. While Rovner visited China in 1995 and gave the suite a geographic title, these images nonetheless suggests a more ambiguous, almost cosmological setting, one of struggle as the figures press on in their journey, their blurred movements barely captured.\n",

Subverting the recognizable and allowing the familiar to become strange through odd juxtapositions, details, and illogical compositions, Salles pictures leave the viewer to develop meaning out of layered images and surrealistic disjunctions. His repertoire has included erotically charged representations of nude women borrowed from pornographic magazines, quotations from Theodore Gericaults paintings of corpses, and actual pieces of furniture affixed to the canvas.The left half of the diptych Comedy is executed in grisaille, a technique that has been historically used to render figures. In the right panel, a domestic scene derived from a 1950s advertisement for a bedroom set is turned on its side and, as in much of the artists early work, layered with additional painted imagery: a black-and-white fashion photograph in which the female figure is, disconcertingly, a headless mannequin; a garland of butterflies surrounding the photo; a ruffled harlequin collar of translucent cloth. The appearance of the harlequin costume in Salles paintings of the early 1990s alludes to his own involvement with cinema and the performing arts, in particular, his collaborations with choreographer Karole Armitage.Salle also created a pendent for the diptych entitled Tragedy (1995) with the same four grisaille figures in a similar arrangement but with different expressions and gestures; for example, the man who grins in an exaggerated fashion in Comedy likewise frowns in Tragedy. The paired titles may similarly refer to Salles set and costume designs for theater and dance, as well as his venture into directing in the film Search and Destroy (1995). A cinematic influence can also be detected in Salles juxtapositions of vignettes that evoke filmic montage in which visual elements are arranged to produce meaning not otherwise present in the individual images.Joan Young\r\n        ",

Though his work has had a tremendous impact on the studied casualness of much recent fashion photography, Tillmans is not a \"fashion photographer.\" If anything he is a portraitist who often photographs his friendswho appear alternately tough, vulnerable, loving, ferocious, gay, and straightin intimate situations. Though these probing images reflect his own subjective experiences, they also operate on a more general level, recording a specific dimension of our contemporary culture.

    "description": "\nDescription\nCai Guo-Qiang studied stage design at the Shanghai Drama Institute and emerged as a member of Chinas experimental art movements that burgeoned in the early 1980s postreform era. He moved to Japan in 1986 and has been based in New York since 1995. His work responds to and signifies the expanded parameters of art making and cultural identity in a global era. Best known for his use of gunpowder, which was invented by the Chinese as an elixir of immortality, Cai mines its charged identification with China, original medicinal use, and ongoing equation with violence. Explosives are central to Cais signature gunpowder drawings, which are made by igniting gunpowder on fibrous paper leaving the charred residue of the original matter. Gunpowder is also the essential material for his explosion events, which are outdoor, site-specific pyrotechnic displays, often on a monumental scale.The Guggenheims album belongs to a series of explosion events and related gunpowder drawings, The Century with Mushroom Clouds: Project for the 20th Century (199596). In this series, Cai reimagined one of historys greatest weapons of mass destruction as art. The mushroom-cloud forms evoking nuclear explosions are juxtaposed with an actual Lingzhi mushroom, a medicinal ingredient. For Cai, the forces of destruction are in a dialectical process of creation and healing, and the only constant is change itself.Cai also creates large-scale installations, often using overt Asian imagery embedded with social and political critique. Cry Dragon/Cry Wolf: The Ark of Genghis Khan (1996), first realized at the Guggenheim Museum SoHo in competition for the Hugo Boss Prize 1996, uses stereotypical imagery: traditional sheepskin rafts are installed across a gallery to look like the spine of a dragon, and the works title cites Asias most famous warrior, whose invasions reached as far as Eastern Europe. Cai inserted three running Toyota car engines, which augment Genghis Khans historic military threat with functioning products of East Asias current economic threat. This installation is more than a spectacular reinvigoration of Chinese cultural devices; it critiques the West for its staid imaginary of China while inferring the undercurrent of conflict that has characterized U.S.-Asia relations from the Cold War into the era of globalization.

    "description": "\nDescription\nRichard Serra has long been acclaimed for his challenging and innovative work, which emphasizes the process of its fabrication, characteristics of materials, and an engagement with viewer and site. In the early 1960s, Serra and the Minimalist artists of his generation turned to unconventional, industrial materials and began to accentuate the physical properties of their work. Relieved of its symbolic role, freed from the traditional pedestal, and introduced into the real space of the viewer, sculpture took on a new relationship to the spectator whose phenomenological experience of an object became crucial to its meaning. Viewers were encouraged to move aroundand sometimes on, in, or throughthe works, many of which cannot be fully understood without peripatetic examination. Over the years Serra has expanded his spatial and temporal approach to sculpture and has focused primarily on large-scale, site-specific works that create a dialogue with a particular architectural, urban, or landscape setting.\nSnake, a work made for the inauguration of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, consists of three enormous, serpentine ribbons of hot-rolled steel that are permanently installed in the museum's Fish gallery. Although it weighs around 180 tons, the colossal work is experienced through its negative spaces. The two tilted, snaking passages, capture a rare sense of motion and instability. Snake preceded Serra's Torqued Ellipses, the artist's most recent rumination on the physicality of space and the nature of sculpture. Both Snake and the Torqued Ellipses seem to defy gravity \r\nand logic, making solid metal appear as malleable as felt. Shifting in unexpected ways as viewers walk in and around them, these sculptures create surprising experiences of space and balance, and provoke a dizzying sensation of steel and space in motion.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMatthew Barney's CREMASTER cycle (19942002) is a self-enclosed aesthetic system consisting of five feature-length films that explore processes of creation. The cycle unfolds not just cinematically but also through the photographs, drawings, sculptures, and installations the artist produces in conjunction with each episode. Its conceptual departure point is the male cremaster muscle, which controls testicular contractions in response to external stimuli. The project is rife with anatomical allusions to the position of the reproductive organs during the embryonic process of sexual differentiation: CREMASTER 1 (1995) represents the most \"ascended\" or undifferentiated state; CREMASTER 5 (1997), the most \"descended\" or differentiated. The cycle repeatedly returns to those moments during early sexual development in which the outcome of the process is still unknownin Barney's metaphoric universe, these moments represent a condition of pure potentiality.CREMASTER 1 takes place in the Bronco Stadium in Boise, Idaho. The film parodies the musical extravaganzas of Busby Berkeley as filtered through the lens of Leni Riefenstahl's Third Reich athletics. Chorus girls form outlines of reproductive organs on a football field, their movements determined from above by a starlet, who inhabits two blimps simultaneously and creates anatomical diagrams by lining up rows of grapes. CREMASTER 2 (1999) alternates between the Columbia Icefield in Canada and the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. It is a gothic Western premised loosely on the real-life story of Gary Gilmore, who was executed in Utah for murder. Gilmore's biography is conveyed through a series of fantastic sequences, including a seance to signify his conception and a prison rodeo staged in a cast-salt arena to represent his death by firing squad. CREMASTER 3 (2002) is part zombie thriller, part gangster film. As the final installment completed in the series, the film is a distillation of Barney's major themes, filtered through a symbolic matrix involving Freemasonry, Celtic lore, and coded references to the CREMASTER cycle itself. Set in New York's Chrysler Building, CREMASTER 3 also includes detours to the Guggenheim Museum, to the harness track in Saratoga Springs, and to Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. CREMASTER 4 (1994) is set on the Isle of Man, where a motorbike race traverses the landscape, a tap-dancing satyr writhes his way through an underwater canal, and three fairies picnic on a grassy knoll. Part vaudeville, part Victorian comedy of manners, and part road movie, this film portrays sheer drive in its struggle to surpass itself. Set in Budapest, CREMASTER 5 is performed as an opera complete with Jacobin pigeons, a lovelorn queen, and her tragic hero. The narrative flows from the Hungarian State Opera House to the Gellert Baths, which is inhabited by water sprites frolicking in a pool of pearls. As the cycle's concluding chapter, the film traces the story of final release, a physical transcendence that is misunderstood and mourned as loss.\n",

The artist has often used allegory as a point of entry to raise larger issues for consideration, and for this installation, Genghis Khan's reputation as a skillful warrior and conqueror of Eurasia was adroitly appropriated alongside the cautionary tale of The Boy Who Cried Wolf to address Western fears of Asian dominance. Asia's expansionisman actuality in terms of the region's growing economic poweris pointedly, and humorously, emphasized through the artist's choice of symbolically loaded materials. The installation assumes the form of a dragon, formed from large branches affixed with inflated sheepskin bags, which were traditionally used by ancient Mongol warriors alternately to hold drinking water and, when inflated, to use in constructing rafts for crossing rivers. At the lower end of the installation, three Toyota engines remain running, signifying the power of Japanese automobile companies to overtake United States automakers. An earlier version, The Ark of Genghis Khan, was realized in 1996 for a group exhibition that originated at the Nagoya City Art Museum, which is located near the city of Toyota, where the automaker has its headquarters. As part of the installation, the ephemera that line the gallery wall document the mutual dependencecharacterized by attraction and repulsionbetween East and West in the era of globalization. \n",

Known for his use of fireworks in performances and installations, Cai often detonates gunpowder on paper to sketch the final explosion's form. An early work that served as a physical blueprint for a series of explosions, Primeval Fireball: The Project for Projects (1991) comprises the smoky residue of exploded gunpowder spread over seven large folding screens. The explosion tracessurrounded by the artist's sketches, notes, and inscriptionsand the centripetal installation of the screens themselves create a three-dimensional representation of the previously sketched pattern of bursts and diagonals that Cai's fireworks followed over the course of the detonation. The artist has likewise integrated conventional ink drawing with gunpowder as studies for a number of major projects, including Project to Extend the Great Wall of China by 10,000 Meters: Project for Extraterrestrials No.10 (1993); Man, Eagle and Eye in the Sky (2003); and Clear Sky Black Cloud (2006). Cai produced a group of six ink-on-paper studies for Cry Dragon/Cry Wolf: The Ark of Genghis Khan, which was first realized at the Guggenheim Museum SoHo in 1996. Comparatively simple, these drawings schematize the forms and components of the installation, which consists of 108 sheepskin bags suspended from the ceiling, affixed to a frame made of branches, and arranged in the form of a dragon, culminating in three running Toyota engines at the tail. Exemplifying Cai's use of allegory to consider larger issues, the allusions to Genghis Khan's reputation as a skillful warrior and conqueror of Eurasia alongside Aesop's fable \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\" together address Western fears of Asian dominance. The continent's expansion in economic power is pointedly, and humorously, emphasized through symbolically loaded materials like the sheepskin bags that Genghis Khan's conquering armies used as water storage and makeshift rafts as well as the engines that connote Japan's undeniably successful auto industry. The importance of the material can be seen in the installation itself; the drawings instead capture Cai's close consideration of form. The distinctive curve of the suspended bags is explored in ink, simultaneously examining their profiles and accumulated mass, at times in relation to human scale and sketched signifiers of the natural world such as trees. Flanked by notes and inscriptions, specific details are subsumed by the abstract drawings, which coalesce into recognizable ruminations and projections of the resulting installation.\n",

The importance of the material can be seen in the installation itself; the drawings instead capture Cai's close consideration of form. The distinctive curve of the suspended bags is explored in ink, simultaneously examining their profiles and accumulated mass, at times in relation to human scale and sketched signifiers of the natural world such as trees.

    "description": "\nDescription\nA sculptor versed in multiple materials, including iron, steel, wood, plaster, and stone, Eduardo Chillida investigates how the solid relates to the void, time to space, and the interior to the exterior. His oeuvre is threaded with these commonalities in intention and theme, the use of material often directing the aesthetic dimensions of the work. Chillidas choice of material was fundamentally informed by his surroundings as well as his travels in the 1960s to Greece; Rome, Umbria, and Tuscany, all in Italy; and Provence, France, ignited what would be a lifelong interest in the relationship between light and architecture. Chillida sought to capture a quality of light he had initially encountered in artworks at the Louvre in Paris. He began using alabaster for its illuminated yet veiled appearance, its ability to simultaneously reveal and conceal, not unlike the atmospheric, dark, and foggy glow of the Basque countryside, Chillidas homeland. Though not traditional to his roots, alabaster has a weighted presence in the history of sculpture.\nHow profound is the Air (1996) combines the roughly hewn, natural exterior of the stone with a highly finished, interior architectural space. The title is a reference to writer Jorge Guillen and reveals the sculptors attitude toward space, or air, which to him is a material as essential as stone or wood. In the words of the artist, Space must be conceived in terms of plastic volume. . . . Form springs spontaneously from the needs of the space that builds its dwelling like an animal its shell. Just like this animal I am also an architect of the void.1\nChillidas focus on the void is perhaps most apparent in his alabaster works, solid forms with carved windows through which shafts of light enter. The diffused light calls attention to the carved space as it passes through the void, illuminating the air and creating a pointed contrast with the solidity of the surrounding form.\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the years around 1980, Francesco Clemente was one of a group of young Italian painters who broke free from the sterile abstraction of Minimalism and the humble materialism of Arte Povera, art movements that had pronounced painting, especially figurative painting, a dead medium. The painting revival that began in Italy sparked an international stylistic shift that persisted throughout the 1980s and involved artists such as Georg Baselitz, Anselm Kiefer, and Julian Schnabel. Known broadly as Neo-Expressionism, this movement revitalized painting and brought back individual expression by using sensuous color, gestural technique, narrative content, and the human figure on a grand scale.La stanza della madre was a commission for the inauguration of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. This series of seventeen panels evokes the large-scale decorative murals of Medieval and Renaissance palaces. As is usual with Clemente, elements from previous works reappear, defying any strictly linear definition of stylistic development. The artists recurrent motifs serve as a visual lexicon linking one work to the next. References to elemental forcesearth, water, fire, and airare juxtaposed with symbolism from Indian culture, religious history, and astrology. In La stanza della madre, Clemente used a stage backdrop from the 1920s as his canvas. The patches in the material and its faded background design serve as the basis for the painting and enhance the lyricism of the work. Finally, stanza recalls the Renaissance stanze, rooms that provide refuge from the outside world.Clementes metaphoric vocabulary is deeply rooted in the body, and the artists many variations on the human form indicate its primacy as a symbol for how he envisions the world. Representing both wholeness and fragmentation, freedom and constriction, the body is Clementes ultimate vehicle for expressing lifes dualities, especially in the many portraits and self-portraits produced throughout his career. In much of Clementes work, eyes and genitals are prominent. For him, these sensitive regions serve as channels between the interior realm of the psyche and the exterior world of nature and culture. An artist with close ties to Italy, America, and India, Clemente has always used the influence of foreign cultures to explore the interface between self and surroundings.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nStan Douglas utilizes forms of popular entertainmentcinema and televisionto destabilize narratives that depict society as a unified, homogeneous front with one history, one set of desires, and one value system. Whether emulating the evening news during the 1968 race riots or restaging a scene from Alfred Hitchcocks Marnie, Douglas disrupts representational systems by introducing unsettling elements of difference. Issues of race and class infiltrate his entire project.Douglass Monodramas, ten 30- to 60-second videos conceived as interventions into commercial television, interrupted the usual flow of advertising and entertainment when broadcast nightly in British Columbia for three weeks in 1992. These micronarratives mimic televisions editing techniques, but as kernels of a story they refuse to cohere. They are tales of dysfunction and dislocation, misanthropy and misunderstanding: a car and a school bus nearly collide at an intersection, only to drive away; a pedestrian greets an Afro-Canadian man he encounters on the street but is told in response, Im not Gary. When the videos were aired unannounced during commercial breaks, viewers called the station to inquire about what was being sold, their responses evincing how the media can refocus attention from content to consumption.The film installation Der Sandmann investigates the intersection of history and memory as witnessed against the backdrop of postCold War Germany. Shot on 16mm film in the old Ufa studios near Potsdam, the piece fuses E.T.A. Hoffmanns eponymous tale, Freuds citation of it in The Uncanny, his study of repression and repetition, as well as the social impulses behind 19th-century German urban planning, which instituted the Schrebergarten, plots of leasable land on which the poor could grow their own food. Projected as two separate but intersecting videos showing the garden at different chronological pointsin use during the 1960s and as a construction site some 20 years laterDer Sandmann contemplates temporality and the transformative effects of history.Nutka similarly utilizes image bifurcation, this time to explore the history of colonialization on Vancouver Island, where English and Spanish fleets battled over trade routes in the 18th century. Films of the landscapethe only imagery shownare superimposed on one screen so that the footage appears doubled. This formal effect is echoed by the soundtrack, which includes excerpts from the sea captains diaries, which become increasingly paranoid and irrational. At key moments in the narrative all visual and verbal elements meld together in exquisite clarity.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

She is interested in isolating dramatic moments from larger plots such as Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, visible in two series: wonder (199697) and override (1997). In Gaskell's style of narrative photography, of which Cindy Sherman is a pioneer, the image is carefully planned and staged; the scene presented is artificial in that it exists only to be photographed. While this may be similar to the process of filmmaking, there is an important difference. Gaskell's photographs are not tied together by a linear thread; it is as though their events all take place simultaneously, in an ever-present. Each image's before and after are lost, allowing possible interpretations to multiply. In untitled #9 of the wonder series, a wet bar of soap has been dragged along a wooden floor. In untitled #17 it appears again, forced into a girl's mouth, with no explanation of how or why. This suspension of time and causality lends Gaskell's images a remarkable ambiguity that she uses to evoke a vivid and dreamlike world.Gaskell's girls do not represent individuals, but act out the contradictions and desires of a single psyche. While their unity is suggested by their identical clothing, the mysterious and often cruel rituals they act out upon each other may be metaphors for disorientation and mental illness. In wonder and override, the character collectively evoked is Alice, perhaps lost in the Wonderland of her own mind, unable to determine whether the bizarre things happening to her are real or the result of her imagination. In wonder, Alice's instability is invoked even at the level of presentation: the varied sizes of the photographs refer to her own growth spurts and shrinking spells. Gaskell's allusions to Carroll's story, however, are not always so playful. The seven versions of Alice in override alternate roles as victim or aggressor. They try to control the changes to Alice's body by literally, physically holding her in placea potent metaphor for the anxiety and confusion experienced by children on the verge of adolescence. hide (1998) derives from a Brothers Grimm tale of a young woman who disguises herself under an animal pelt so that she might escape her own father's proposal of marriage.

    "description": "\nDescription\nWith his keen eye for contour, Ellsworth Kelly extracts visual fragments from the surrounding worldthe sweeping curve of a Romanesque nave, a crescent moon, a barred windowand then condenses them into elemental colors and shapes. Although relentlessly abstract, his forms are anchored to the legible, to details of architecture or landscape, filtered through the artists vision. Early in his career, Kelly adopted a philosophy of anti-illusionism that would change the parameters of painting and revise its relationship to sculpture. He began painting monochrome panels in the early 1950s and has been experimenting with this composition (or anticomposition) ever since in single and multipanel formats. With their anonymous, uninflected technique and absence of surface drawing, these pristine painting-objects established a new relationship between painting and its architectural context. By defining the structure and shape of each canvas through colormatte, uniform, and without gestural nuanceKelly eliminated any figure-ground illusion and brought painting into the sculptural realm of objects; the painting itself became the figure, with the wall as its ground.Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red exemplifies Kellys lucid, forthright style. Five monochrome panels are arranged in the order of the chromatic spectrum, the primary colors balanced by their intermediary values of green and orange. The concentrated colors are charged by their interaction with each other, and the works sizemonumental, yet at a human scale by virtue of its breakdown into vertical panelsfurther strengthens its presence. Dark Blue Curve signals Kellys longtime interest in shaped canvases. It is this focus on peripheral shape identified by color that makes his paintings sculptural, engaging directly with their own forms and the walls around them. The shaped monochromes reinforce the anti-illusionistic project begun with Kellys rectangular panels; unframed and unmarked save for their color, they are a more emphatic denial of the window-onto-the-world view of the traditional four-sided easel painting. Wright Curve, a steel sculpture designed for permanent installation in the Guggenheims Peter B. Lewis Theater, is named after the museums architect, Frank Lloyd Wright. Its affinity with the palette and geometry of the auditorium shows the artists interest in encouraging site-specific experiences of his painting and sculpture. For Kelly, the transition between the two mediums is fluid: sculpture for me is something Ive brought off the wall.Bridget Alsdorf\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThrough his animated films, theatrical productions, and graphic work, William Kentridge addresses the personal and social traumas that are the vestiges of South African apartheid. His ongoing series of short animated films Drawings for Projection (begun in 1989) feature two principal characters, who function as the artist's alter egos: Soho Eckstein, an avaricious South African mining magnate in a pinstriped suit and tie, and Felix Teitlebaum, shown naked and vulnerable to apartheid's devastating acts.In Felix in Exile, the fifth film of the series made between September 1993 and February 1994, Kentridge depicts the barren East Rand landscape as witness to the exploitation of and violence against both natural and human resources. Isolated in a hotel room, Felix peruses the survey charts of Nandi, a young black woman who maps the history of the terrain. Figures and structures are subsumed into the landscape or night sky, allegories for how the land can bear the scars of crimes against humanity.Kentridge created the sixth film History of the Main Complaint in 1996 during the initial hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, at which apartheid's crimes were first publicly admitted while the perpetrators were granted indemnity in the hope of healing profound social and historical wounds in this post-apartheid society. In the film Soho lies comatose in a hospital ward, suffering from the weight of his past acts as well as those for which he is implicated due to his race and class. MRIs and CAT scans reveal his affliction, as memories of violence committed against black South Africans float across the screen. The relationship between individual and collective guilt is played out when Soho regains consciousness only through acknowledging his own responsibility.Kentridge's films reveal traces of their making, just as the narratives invoke memories of an historic time. For each scene, Kentridge films a large charcoal and pastel drawing (measuring approximately 76.2 x 114.3 cm), which he partially erases and redraws, recording each sheet up to 500 times. The cumulative effect of his thought process is retained, leaving residue of the act of production to reflect the tensions between past and present.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nJuan Munoz was known for his enigmatic sculptures of strangely haunting human figures. His sculptural installations are like stage sets populated by maudlin characters, implying narratives of conspiracy, despair, and isolation. Despite the often unsettling qualities of his work, Munoz consistently acknowledged the emotional range of the human condition, from the absurd and irrational to the poignant and humorous. Shown individually and in groups, the figureinspired by ventriloquist dummies, dwarves, and punching-bag clownsis a constant presence in his work. Cast in bronze or resin, the sculptures are modeled with an abbreviated naturalism and can appear convincingly real, although they are often shown in impossible positions, such as seated in chairs mounted on a wall or suspended upside down from existing architectural elements.Since he began exhibiting his work in the late 1980s, the means by which he realized his mise-en-scenes evolved, with small architectural elements appended to exhibition interiors giving way to larger installations that reconfigured and transformed space by cutting through walls or adding false floors. Before his untimely death at the age of forty-eight, Munoz had been steadily building a body of work that engaged the spectator both physically and emotionally. His works can be interpreted as dramas frozen in time. Shadow and Mouth suggests an unfolding narrative or perhaps depicts the moment just after somethingan argument, confrontation, or accusation?has occurred. Shadow and Mouth is typical of Munoz's works in its incorporation of familiar elements (here, ordinary furnishings) used as props in vaguely surreal and nonspecific scenes. The seated figures do not face each other, and they also deny the viewer's impulse to engage them, remaining locked in their own self-contained world. This state of isolation and uncertainty is a potent metaphor for the ambiguities and complexity experienced in contemporary life.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nGabriel Orozco's multimedia works are philosophical investigations of form, medium, and installation. In his own exhibitions, he often employs sculpture, drawing, photography, installation, and video and recycles older work into sometimes new mediums and contexts. The readymade is central to Orozco's process. He frequently manipulates what he discovers by arranging found materials (a deflated soccer ball, cans of cat food, simple planks of wood) and photographing his constructions. Sometimes he transforms the ordinary just by suggesting a form in a seemingly banal image, as in Pulpo (Octopus, 1991), which bestows meaning on a tangle of pipes. Here the readymade is not so much a thing found as a dynamic and poetic interaction between artist and object.Orozco plays photography and sculpture off against one another to create compelling hybrids in the service of his interest in the lightening of mass. This involves streamlining or hollowing out objects that at first appear heavy and cumbersome, as in the sculpture La DS (1993, pronounced like la deesse, French for goddess), a trisected Citroen automobile seamlessly reassembled without the middle section. In Dos Parejas (Two Couples, 1990), heavy industrial objects are playfully anthropomorphized by their title as their sculptural mass is negated through photographic reproduction. In Photogravity (1999), Orozco mounted large versions of his old photographs on spindly legs to produce a sort of two-dimensional sculpture. He uses one medium to expose another's limits: photography can strip sculpture of its mass, but it always lacks the real thing that it pictures.Orozco's photographs document chance encounters with sites and objects in his native Mexico and other locations around the world, including Brazil, Germany, Iceland, India, and New York. Im looking for different kinds of contexts . . . I want to make something in a very clean, white space. Then I want to get outside . . . I grew up in museums, but I also grew up in the streets. Acutely attentive to the various receptions his work engenders in different locations, he seeks to make his viewers aware of their own cultural boundedness. His work ultimately promotes deterritorialization, within which a multiplicity of viewpoints is recognized and none can take precedence. Pelota en agua (Ball on Water, 1994) first appears to be a photograph of a cloud-streaked sky, but turns out to be a reflection captured in a puddle, evidenced by a half-submerged ball. This conflation of sky and earth, lofty and lowly, is emblematic of Orozco's attempt to bridge the distance between oppositional themes and sites.\n",

Notable for its dizzying eclecticism of both subject and style, the artists distinctive practice helped to legitimize the resurgence of painting as a critical medium in the mid-1990s. Although Owenss work may appear casually painted, complex layers often underpin the compositions, as seen in Untitled (1996). Calling to mind Minimalist or geometric painting with pared-down forms in an expanse of white, her art upends expectations and creates instead a rich, palpable sense of depth that seems to extend the confines of the gallery in which the painting is displayed. The viewer is drawn into an overlarge space bracketed by foreshortened paintings in a summary of Renaissance one-point perspective. The central focus is on an expanse of night sky, though Owens has wryly obfuscated whether this is another painting or a window to nature. In either option, Owens balances two- and three-dimensionality in a disorienting rumination on the act of representation.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nShortly before entering art school, Elizabeth Charlotte Rist took the name Pipilotti, combining her childhood nickname, Lotti, with Pippi Longstocking, the heroine of the Swedish children's book series. Rist's identification with the girl-adventurera playful yet fiercely independent orphan who possesses magical strengthpoints to several features of her work: her ready borrowing from popular culture, whimsical exploration of the fantastic, and unconventional approach to female subjectivity.Since emerging in the mid-1980s, Rist has drawn as much from the language of the mass media as she has from first-generation video artists like Nam June Paik. In particular, the saturated colors, hallucinatory effects, and prominent sound tracks of her works have elicited comparisons to the language of music videos. While exploiting the sensuous qualities of the medium, however, Rist eschews popular conventions of narrative and spectatorship, especially in the way that she presents female subjects. Sip My Ocean, a video projected as two mirrored reflections on adjoining walls, offers a kaleidoscopic view of an idyllic underwater paradise, with a flowing sequence of dreamlike images, including intermittent close-ups of a bikini-clad woman floating and swimming through the waves along with views of various domestic objects sinking to the seabed. The implicit voyeurism and exaggerated hyperfeminity of such images are complicated by the accompanying sound track, in which the artist's rendition of Chris Isaac's melancholy pop song Wicked Game is punctuated by her repeated shrieking of the lyrics I don't want to fall in love. Although she denies having an explicitly feminist agenda, Rist frequently merges eroticism and coquettishness with aggression and hysteria to produce provocative fantasies of female empowerment.Rist's video installations since the mid-1990s have varied radically in scale and context, from a thumb-size monitor embedded in the floor to a billboard-size projection in New York's Times Square. Himalaya's Sister's Living Room is one of several room-size environments in which she has explored domestic space. The work beckons the viewer into a dimly lit interior cluttered with furniture and objects from different eras, some of which are uncannily animated by videos cast from hidden projectors: on a side table, the artist presses her face against a windowpane; a liquor bottle atop a 1950s-era bar glows with a soccer game. Rist has noted that the moving picture itself is always a room within another room. Just as she employs video to explore the interiority of her female characters, here she uses projections to penetrate inanimate objects, uncovering the thoughts and memories embedded within the collective space of the household.\n",

While his art defies neat categorization, it is frequently characterized by an embrace of spectacle and cliche and a blurring of the boundary between high and low culture, often in ways that deliberately set out to provoke or create misunderstandings. Uklanski is perhaps best known for his 1996 installation Untitled (Dance Floor), which crosses a modernist grid with a fully functioning, sound-synchronized disco floor. The work has been adapted to various museum and gallery spaces over the years (including the Museum of Modern Art, New Yorks sculpture garden, pictured here in 2000). On one level, it is a clever Pop (or kitsch) spin-off of Carl Andres comparatively austere, Minimalist metal floor sculptures. But Dance Floor also creates a convivial space for social interaction, which ultimately depends on the viewer to complete the piece, much like the installations of one of Uklanskis contemporaries, Rirkrit Tiravanija. Uklanski explains that he set out to create a work that would be all generosity and no ideology. An object that would give and give and give but that would, at the end of the night, be unknowable, as its true nature resides in our own pleasure.Ted Mann\n",

Influenced by the British documentary filmmaking tradition, Wearing has frequently used real-life individuals as her subjects. For the series that first brought her notice, Signs that say what you want to say and not signs that say what someone else wants you to say (19921993), she photographed strangers on the street holding handwritten placards that advertised their thoughts, feelings, and anxieties. In subsequent video works, she documented the intimate confessions of people who masked their identities through various means: in 10-16 (1997), adult actors lip-synch the prerecorded secrets of adolescents; in Trauma (2000), adults wearing plastic masks with generic children's faces divulge traumatic experiences from their youths.Wearing has also examined the private sphere of the family. In her video Sacha and Mum (1996), she directed actors and manipulated the editing process to create a film that explores the complex, contradictory nature of a mother-daughter relationship. Sacha and her mother share an intimate moment as they smile and hug in a bedroom, yet their embrace slowly shifts into a tussle. As love and aggression blur, the mother begins to tug, pull, and otherwise physically dominate her daughter. Sacha's odd vulnerability and her mother's aggressive volatility are underscored by the speeded up video, which quickens their gestures, and the distored sound track that transforms their speech into anxious gibberish. By the film's end, it is unclear whether Sacha is a disturbed person whose mother is trying to calm her, or if the mother is a disturbed aggressor from whom Sacha is trying to free herself.\n",

Transparent wells of light, they are at once pure depth and reflective surface. As in Roni Horns metal sculptureincluding pairs of solid copper conesa perfect convergence between interior and exterior transpires. Only here, the oscillation between the two dimensions is visible, even palpable. The work is one of Horns pair objects, which exploit the principle of duplication in order to explore the concept of unity. The twin components reveal themselves simultaneously and sequentially. Through its repetition of form, Untitled (Flannery) embodies a here and a there. It is a site marked by traversal and progression, requiring the viewer to move from one element to the other in a dialectical experience of part to whole. Ideally installed with one block illuminated by sunlight and the other nearby in shadow, the work imagines the passage of a day from dawn until dusk; its temporal narrative also encompasses a now and a then.Untitled (Flannery) is an ode to blueness. Profoundly allusive, blue can connote a musical genre; a state of melancholy; or an aristocratic pedigree. Blue is visible everywhere in nature; it is the color of the ether that surrounds us. Blue is a tangible reality, but one that remains infinitely out of reach. According to the artist, the sculpture is a window that opens onto a state of blueness, the depths of which mine metaphysical and psychological territories.The diptych Dead Owlfor which the artist photographed a stuffed snowy owl twiceis also a pair object. This work derives from Arctic Circles, the seventh volume of Horns ongoing series of publications collectively entitled To Place, in which she maps her physical and emotional interaction with the topography, climate, and architecture of Iceland, a country she has traveled to repeatedly since 1975. Each volume engages a distinct system of knowing, a way of recording perception that reveals as much about Iceland as it does Horns own insights into her ever-shifting identification with this island nation. A photographic essay, Arctic Circles records the endless horizon of the North Sea, the feathers of an eider nest, and the rotating beacon of a lighthouse, invoking in form the very circumference of Iceland. The owls double stare, as it loops outward and back, seems to form a figure eightthe sign of infinitywhile the dual images perpetuate a constant and essential shifting between identity and difference.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

What began as an investigation of the artist's own body in spacehow it interacts with a given environment and how, in turn, that location affects ithas evolved into the construction of space itself. This trajectory is inscribed from the private, photographic recording of the body in a designated site to his more recent creation of sites for public engagement. The relationship of the private to the publicand how the self participates in the surrounding worldhas been a constant theme in Acconci's art. In 1969, already a published poet, Acconci made his first visual artworks, moving from the static domain of the printed page to the dynamic space of the empirical world. Combining photographs with texts, the artist documented task-oriented activitiesjumping, stretching, bending, etc.that he performed specifically for the lens. In Grasp (1969), Acconci acknowledges the archival capabilities of photography\"camera as grasp, photo as storage\"but foregrounds the performative act of picture taking, of physically seizing an image. This project announces the dialogue between camera and body that is essential to Acconci's subsequent work, particularly in the series of videos and Super 8 films made between 1969 and 1974 in which he obsessively contemplates his own body as a (gendered) site. These privately filmed performances (which are also documented in photo/text panels) involve a level of corporeal manipulation that borders on masochismAcconci is shown plucking hairs from around his navel, throwing soapy water into his eyes, and cramming his fist in his mouth. In Conversions II (1971), the second in a trilogy of films interrogating the rigidity of gender binarism, the artist attempts to feminize his unquestionably male body by hiding his genitals between his legs. By casting his own masculinity into question, by performing its absence, Acconci problematizes the dictum that the male (or female) subject is a coherent being. Acconci's  TELE-FURNI-SYSTEM (1997), an installation designed for watching video (his own and those of other artists), invites each visitor to interact with the environment by choosing his or her own viewing positions from a menu of different architectural options. Each monitor serves as a separate video channel and a building block in the network of stairs, benches, and lounges that constitute the piece. Here it is the viewer who activates the space by physically engaging with it and contemplating the panoply of moving images on display. Nancy Spector\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMatthew Barney's CREMASTER cycle (19942002) is a self-enclosed aesthetic system consisting of five feature-length films that explore processes of creation. The cycle unfolds not just cinematically but also through the photographs, drawings, sculptures, and installations the artist produces in conjunction with each episode. Its conceptual departure point is the male cremaster muscle, which controls testicular contractions in response to external stimuli. The project is rife with anatomical allusions to the position of the reproductive organs during the embryonic process of sexual differentiation: CREMASTER 1 (1995) represents the most \"ascended\" or undifferentiated state; CREMASTER 5 (1997), the most \"descended\" or differentiated. The cycle repeatedly returns to those moments during early sexual development in which the outcome of the process is still unknownin Barney's metaphoric universe, these moments represent a condition of pure potentiality.CREMASTER 1 takes place in the Bronco Stadium in Boise, Idaho. The film parodies the musical extravaganzas of Busby Berkeley as filtered through the lens of Leni Riefenstahl's Third Reich athletics. Chorus girls form outlines of reproductive organs on a football field, their movements determined from above by a starlet, who inhabits two blimps simultaneously and creates anatomical diagrams by lining up rows of grapes. CREMASTER 2 (1999) alternates between the Columbia Icefield in Canada and the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. It is a gothic Western premised loosely on the real-life story of Gary Gilmore, who was executed in Utah for murder. Gilmore's biography is conveyed through a series of fantastic sequences, including a seance to signify his conception and a prison rodeo staged in a cast-salt arena to represent his death by firing squad. CREMASTER 3 (2002) is part zombie thriller, part gangster film. As the final installment completed in the series, the film is a distillation of Barney's major themes, filtered through a symbolic matrix involving Freemasonry, Celtic lore, and coded references to the CREMASTER cycle itself. Set in New York's Chrysler Building, CREMASTER 3 also includes detours to the Guggenheim Museum, to the harness track in Saratoga Springs, and to Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. CREMASTER 4 (1994) is set on the Isle of Man, where a motorbike race traverses the landscape, a tap-dancing satyr writhes his way through an underwater canal, and three fairies picnic on a grassy knoll. Part vaudeville, part Victorian comedy of manners, and part road movie, this film portrays sheer drive in its struggle to surpass itself. Set in Budapest, CREMASTER 5 is performed as an opera complete with Jacobin pigeons, a lovelorn queen, and her tragic hero. The narrative flows from the Hungarian State Opera House to the Gellert Baths, which is inhabited by water sprites frolicking in a pool of pearls. As the cycle's concluding chapter, the film traces the story of final release, a physical transcendence that is misunderstood and mourned as loss.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe work of Douglas Gordon revolves around a constellation of dualities and dialectics. Mistaken identities, doubles, split personalities, and such opposites as good and evil, and self and other are thematized as inseparable. Gordon's films, video installations, photographs, and texts transform differences into uncanny, nuanced pairs.Gordon approaches film as ready-made or found object, mining the potential collective memory that exists in cinematic fragments, and in the process, disclosing unseen or overlooked details and associations. His installation through a looking glass (1999) features the well-known scene from Martin Scorsese's 1976 film Taxi Driver in which Travis Bickle, played by Robert De Niro, asks, You talkin' to me? while gazing into a mirror. In Gordons piece, the scene is projected onto dual screens placed on opposite walls of a gallery space. The original episode from the movie, filmed as a reflection in the mirror, is shown on one wall. The other screen displays the same episode with the image reversed, flipped left to right. The two facing images, which begin in sync, progressively fall out of step, echoing the character's loss of control and his mental breakdown. These discordant projected images seem to respond to one another, thus trapping the viewer in the crossfire. In its almost dizzying play of dualities, through a looking glass perfectly articulates the dialectical inversions, doublings, and repetitions that are the central concerns of Gordon's work.Gordon also uses still photography to capture performative acts, as in Tattoo (for Reflection) (1997). In accordance with Gordon's instructions, the writer Oscar van den Boogaard had the word guilty tattooed in reverse on the back of his left shoulder; the tattoo can only be read via its reflection in a mirror. Gordon revels in the mixed messages found in the tattoo's various cultural associations, from its use as an identifying mark on prisoners to its current incarnation as a subculture status symbol. In true Gordonian, reflexive fashionwith the word legible on van den Boogaards back only when reversedthe photograph becomes an index of an index.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAndreas Gurskys photographic vision is extraordinarily precise. Every imagewhether of a Rhine landscape, rave dance floor, or factory interiorunfolds to reveal an intrinsic organizing principle. Teasing an eccentric geometry out of each of his subjects, Gursky reorders the world according to his own visual logic, accumulating myriad tiny details to offer a sense of harmonic coherence. There is a documentary impulse behind Gurskys work, one inherited from his German forebearsAugust Sander, the early 20th-century encyclopedic chronicler of occupational typologies, and his own professors, Bernd and Hilla Becher, who systematically record architectural relics of the industrial age. Gurskys subject matter is late-capitalist society and the systems of exchange that organize it, and his practice is equally totalizing and taxonomic. His pictures may be described as modern-day versions of classical history painting in that they reproduce the collective mythologies that fuel contemporary culture: travel and leisure (sporting events, clubs, airports, hotel interiors, art galleries), finance (stock exchanges, sites of commerce), material production (factories, production lines), and information (libraries, book pages, data). Large in scale and brilliantly lit, Gurskys color photographs emulate the physicality of oil on canvas.Despite the traditions he invokes both formally and conceptually, Gursky has no pretense to objectivity. He digitally manipulates his imagescombining discrete views of the same subject, deleting extraneous details, enhancing colorsto create a kind of assisted realism. The traders on the floor of the Singapore stock exchange, in Gurskys version, all wear the same shade of red, yellow, or blue jacket. And his epic view of the Stockholm public library, a perfect hemisphere of color-coded books, omits the actual floor, which, in reality, includes an escalator that would have marred the symmetrical beauty of the image. According to art historian Norman Bryson, the critical paradox of Gurskys photography lies in its dual commitment to objectively observing the social strata at work in the world and to aestheticizing empirical reality, an impulse that almost sabotages the science of his project. In this dialectic, the artist provocatively undermines photographys claims for truth, offering, instead, as Bryson suggests, an inquiry into the subjective dimensions of all representations of the social.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nJenny Holzer began the Truisms series in 1977 as a distillation of an erudite reading list from the Whitney Independent Study Program in New York City, where she was a student; by 1979 she had written several hundred one-liners. Beginning with a \"little knowledge goes a long way\" and ending with \"your oldest fears are your worst ones,\" the Truisms employ a variety of voices and express a wide spectrum of biases and beliefs. If any consistent viewpoint emerges in the edgy, stream-of-consciousness provocations it is that truth is relative and that each viewer must participate in determining what is legitimate and what is not. Since the Truisms, Holzer has used language exclusively and has employed myriad ways to convey her messages. Selections from her Inflammatory Essays series, for example, appeared on unsigned, commercially printed posters, which were wheat-pasted on buildings and walls around Manhattan.When such Holzer phrases as \"abuse of power comes as no surprise\" and \"money creates taste\" flashed from the Spectacolor board above Times Square in 1982, it marked her first appropriation of electronic signage. In doing so, she brought her disquieting messages to a new height of subversive social engagement. Her strategyplacing surprising texts where normal signage is expectedgives Holzer direct access to a large public that might not give art any consideration, while allowing her to undermine forms of power and control that often go unnoticed.In Holzer's 1989 retrospective installation at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, blinking messages from her various series, programmed to an insistent but silent beat, raced the length of an L.E.D. display board installed along the winding inner wall of Frank Lloyd Wright's spiral ramp. Her Installation for Bilbaonine vertical L.E.D. signboards, each more than 40 feet hightransmit aphorisms in Basque, Spanish, and English. Developed over time, the texts were first written for an AIDS fund-raising event. While consideration of the epidemic provides an immediate and tragic context, these writingssuch as \"I say your name\" and \"I save your clothes\"evoke universal themes of intimacy, death, and loss. In bringing her art from the street to museum environments, Holzer focuses on an audience that differs markedly from the unsuspecting passerby. These installations address such issues as the viability of public art, the commodification and consumption of art, and the conflation of the personal and the political.\n",

Transparent wells of light, they are at once pure depth and reflective surface. As in Roni Horns metal sculptureincluding pairs of solid copper conesa perfect convergence between interior and exterior transpires. Only here, the oscillation between the two dimensions is visible, even palpable. The work is one of Horns pair objects, which exploit the principle of duplication in order to explore the concept of unity. The twin components reveal themselves simultaneously and sequentially. Through its repetition of form, Untitled (Flannery) embodies a here and a there. It is a site marked by traversal and progression, requiring the viewer to move from one element to the other in a dialectical experience of part to whole. Ideally installed with one block illuminated by sunlight and the other nearby in shadow, the work imagines the passage of a day from dawn until dusk; its temporal narrative also encompasses a now and a then.Untitled (Flannery) is an ode to blueness. Profoundly allusive, blue can connote a musical genre; a state of melancholy; or an aristocratic pedigree. Blue is visible everywhere in nature; it is the color of the ether that surrounds us. Blue is a tangible reality, but one that remains infinitely out of reach. According to the artist, the sculpture is a window that opens onto a state of blueness, the depths of which mine metaphysical and psychological territories.The diptych Dead Owlfor which the artist photographed a stuffed snowy owl twiceis also a pair object. This work derives from Arctic Circles, the seventh volume of Horns ongoing series of publications collectively entitled To Place, in which she maps her physical and emotional interaction with the topography, climate, and architecture of Iceland, a country she has traveled to repeatedly since 1975. Each volume engages a distinct system of knowing, a way of recording perception that reveals as much about Iceland as it does Horns own insights into her ever-shifting identification with this island nation. A photographic essay, Arctic Circles records the endless horizon of the North Sea, the feathers of an eider nest, and the rotating beacon of a lighthouse, invoking in form the very circumference of Iceland. The owls double stare, as it loops outward and back, seems to form a figure eightthe sign of infinitywhile the dual images perpetuate a constant and essential shifting between identity and difference.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nCristina Iglesias's large-scale, minimal sculptures are architecturally dependent. She describes her works as pieces that are like thought, places from which one sees, spaces that fall between reality and image, between presence and representation, spaces that speak of other spaces. One of an emerging generation of Spanish artists who gained international recognition for their sculpture during the 1990s, Iglesias creates works that articulate a delicate balance between physical and visual qualities. Characteristic of her sculpture is the juxtaposition of imposing, large-scale forms made of concrete, iron, or aluminum with intricately etched surfaces and sumptuous materials such as glass, alabaster, and tapestry.Concerned with the issues of form and space as they occur in nature, Iglesias, in effect, creates her own pared-down, sculptural landscapes. Enlisting materials such as bamboo, leaves, and vines as her models, Iglesias works her surfaces with rich waxes and patinas, which often catch natural light from the windowed portions of her pieces. Her sculptures, roughly hewn yet sensitively modeled, fuse the organic with the industrial and, though of generous proportion, are nearly all constructed on a human scale. Iglesias's compositionally varied architectural appendages generate a dialogue with the surrounding space, beckoning the viewer to circumnavigate the work.One of a series, Untitled (Jealousy II) uses a form drawn from Iglesias's cultural heritagea screen similar to those used in confessional booths of Catholic churchesto infer that the eponymous emotion is sinful. As Nancy Princenthal has noted, the Spanish title Celosia is both the word for a louvered window covering and for jealousy. As blinds function to keep light out, the title suggests the limited perception afforded while incarcerated by this irrational state. Permitting only filtered views of its interior, Iglesias's chamber functions as both a provocative barrier and a structure for ostensible protection. As with many of her works, the viewer is left to wonder how things appear from the inside.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nPioneering thought-provoking possibilities in the range and scope of contemporary sculpture, Anish Kapoor investigates the limits of mass, form, structure, and space. Whether working with Cor-Ten steel, stainless steel, or fiberglass to create monumental and technically sophisticated public sculptures, or showcasing intimate, terrene works that appear to be biomorphic mounds or geometric shapes variously emerging from floors, hanging from ceilings, or sprouting from walls, he has created a body of work that questions the universes polarities.\nEastern-inspired metaphysics, in which ideas and forms are often pared down to their simplest expression, is a thread throughout Kapoors oeuvre. This impulse toward minimalism results in an uncluttered space in which viewers can contemplate and meditate on his work. Kapoor manipulates natural and man-made materials in order to alter and complicate the surrounding space and distort viewers overall perspective on light, darkness, balance, mood, and visual perception.\nUntitled is part of Kapoors experiments with freestanding spatial voids carved from natural materials, an ongoing series that he began in 1987 by working with stone. With this work, the artist deploys his iconic use of elemental matter, in this case a massive slab of Italian alabaster, to address signature themes of dualitysuch as absence versus presence, spirit versus body, invisible versus visible, and illusory versus tangibleas well as the physical opposition between the convex and the concave. With the void in particular, Kapoor returns to one of the oldest and most universal artistic subjects: the womb as the nexus of creation and regeneration. \nKapoor leaves the pieces outer surface roughly hewn while the front-facing area is flat and highly polished. At its center is a deeply carved cavity that hollows out toward the back and disappears from full view. With earlier voids, Kapoor saturated the sculptures cavities with colorful powder-based pigments. In contrast, Untitled leaves the alabaster in its natural state, allowing natural light to filter through and dance off the minerals iridescent surface. The dynamism of Untitled is engendered by Kapoors ability to create incredible physical geometry out of a sizeable stonework while still preserving the alabasters innate beauty, delicacy, and organic quality.\nMiesha Shih\n",

Whether addressing society or politics, the economy or the environment, Rosenquist has been inspired by current events throughout his career.When Rosenquist visited Berlin not long after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the great disparity between the former East and West zones was palpable. Rosenquist nonetheless witnessed an emerging energy and noted, \"I thought of a person struggling and working, like a swimmer in the fog, going somewhere, not knowing quite where [he or she is] going, but forcefully working, working, working.\" It was timely that the artist received a commission for the Deutsche Guggenheim, a gallery in the heart of former East Berlin, now a thriving cosmopolitan center.Rosenquist described The Swimmer in the Econo-mist, a three-painting suite that conveys the epic technological, political, and economic momentum of the past century, as a \"diary of the terrible temper of the times.\" The artist reprises the wraparound environment of F-111 and recalls his earlier works Masquerade of the Military Industrial Complex Looking Down on the Insect World (1992) and Military Intelligence (1994). The Swimmer in the Econo-mist additionally includes quotations from Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937), a depiction of the Nazi German bombing of Guernica, Spain, during the Spanish Civil War. These abstracted images, which evoke painful memories of war and fascism, are immersed in a tumultuous vortex (an optical device new to Rosenquist's iconography) and followed by a panoramic meteor blast of fragmented consumer products. The Swimmer in the Econo-mist further presents a tableau of images that signifies the challenge to assimilate East Berlin and the unquestioning labor of German workers that enabled re-unification. The focal point is the conical hair dryer from F-111, but a proliferation of lipstick tubes have replaced the little girl. One recognizes too the drill bits from Rosenquist's Industrial Cottage (1977) and the colors of the German flag as a window-view sunrise. Although reminding one of the tragic lessons of the past, The Swimmer in the Econo-mist is also a portrait of Germany's dynamic present and optimistic future.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nOver the years, Susana Solano's work has evolved from the realm of two-dimensional surfaces to large-scale sculptures. For her first solo exhibition in 1980 at the Fundacio Joan Miro, in Barcelona, Solano presented works of canvas, brass, and wood whose qualitieslack of gesture and a focus on materialsforecast those of her future works. She went on to experiment with a diverse range of processes, such as welding, riveting, folding, and hammering, and materials, such as wood, plaster, iron, lead, and even photography. Solano's large constructions suggestive of architectural structures and domestic spaces invite the contemplation of the body in relation to its surroundings. The manner in which her works are arranged create spatial metaphors that have widened the scope for Minimalist sculpture.Joasokor, stark and quiet, serves as a powerful example of Solano's personal, more intimate sculptures. This work comprises a canoe-shaped armature covered with strips of transparent and colorless plastic knotted at regular intervals and, hung in close proximity, a photograph of a native of Oceaniathe first use of an ethnographic component in Solano's work. Although made from manufactured materials, the sculpture is reminiscent of a ritualistic object made, perhaps, for a long house of an Oceanic tribe. This impression is heightened by Solano's color photograph of the face of a South Sea Islander, in close-up and profile, hung on the wall in proximity to the sculpture. Solano was inspired to produce this work by a sojourn in Irian Jaya, the western, Indonesian part of Papua New Guinea where the artist spent time in a small village named Jaosokor.Fragile and unstable on the surface, yet structurally robust, the sculptural component of the installation can be interpreted as an expression of the resistance of autochthonous cultures to the aggressiveness of their Western counterparts. The PVC ties call to mind some of the qualities of foam, water, and the sunlight reflected on its perpetually moving surface. By contrasting synthetic material (PVC) with an intimate artifact (the photograph) Solano comments on the ability of native cultures to endure despite the attraction of superficial, imported ideas.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWolfgang Tillmans's photographs of friends, dance raves, clubs, and night life have appeared regularly in London's i-D magazine and other publications since 1989. Though his work has had a tremendous impact on the studied casualness of much recent fashion photography, Tillmans is not a \"fashion photographer.\" If anything he is a portraitist who often photographs his friendswho appear alternately tough, vulnerable, loving, ferocious, gay, and straightin intimate situations. Though these probing images reflect his own subjective experiences, they also operate on a more general level, recording a specific dimension of our contemporary culture. Tillmans establishes a collaborative process with his models, whom he calls \"accomplices.\" Thus the informal look of the works belies their choreographed construction. Landscape and still-life images also play a crucial role in his oeuvre, in which half-eaten fruit, sewer rats, crumpled clothing, or urban skylines are photographed with the same dignity and attention to beauty as his human subjects. Traditional subject genres are questioned; crumpled clothing might suggest a figure or landscape, while city scenes seen from the air resemble a still life of objects.For Tillmans, the images are only half the work; the installation or layout constitutes its completion. He affixes his prints directly to the wall with pins or tape, juxtaposing old and new images of varying sizes and mediums. He eschews standard darkroom procedures, blurring the lines between color and black and white (printing black-and-white images on color paper, for instance). Color photographs are placed next to inkjet prints and next to postcards and magazine clippings of his own images, contesting conventional hierarchies of scale and subject matter while drawing focus to the materiality of the photographic medium all within a carefully composed environment that seems to disdain permanency.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nPeter Fischli and David Weiss collaborated from 1979 to 2012 on a body of work that celebrateswith great humor and intelligencethe sheer banality of everyday existence. As contemporary flaneurs, they observed their world with bemused detachment, reveling in the mundane and turning every undertaking into a leisure activity. Their earliest projects lampooned the seriousness of high art: for Sausage Series (Wurstserie, 1979), they playfully photographed curious arrangements of sausages and luncheon meats to emulate the tableaux of genre paintings. The iconic themes of Western culture are parodied in a 1981 ensemble of 250 roughly hewn clay figurines representing such extraordinary events as Anna O Dreaming the First Dream Interpreted by Freud; Marco Polo Showing the Italians Spaghetti, Brought Back from China; and For the First Time, Mick Jagger and Brian Jones Going Home Satisfied After Composing I Cant Get No Satisfaction. By the end of the 1980s, the duo had expanded their repertoire to embrace an iconography of the incidental, creating deadpan photographs of kitsch tourist attractions and airports around the world. For their contribution to the 1995 Venice Biennale, at which they represented Switzerland, Fischli/Weiss exhibited 96 hours of video on 12 monitors that documented what they called concentrated daydreamingreal-time glimpses into daily life in Zurich: a mountain sunrise, a restaurant chef in his kitchen, sanitation workers, a bicycle race, and so on.\nFischli and Weisss delight in the ordinary is given perfect form in their flower portraitsdazzlingly colorful, close-up shots of myriad garden plants in bloom or various stages of decay. As in all the previous work in their conceptually driven practice, the flowers undermine conventional distinctions between high and low arta culturally enforced contrast the artists once derided in a clay sculpture of two dachshunds, one standing on its hind legs, the other on all fours. Fashioned in the spirit of amateur photography in both subject and style, the flower portraits employ the technique of double exposure to achieve dizzying layered effects. The process allowed the artists to exploit their collaborative approach: one would shoot an entire roll of film in a suburban rose garden; the other would rewind it and then shoot the same roll in a park in Zurich. Deliberately decorative, these photographs push the limits of acceptability in Conceptual art. The cumulative effect of 111 different pictures, which can be installed in a room like wallpaper, glimpsed image by image as in a print portfolio, or seen singularly as a framed photograph, is one of abundance and kaleidoscopic visual pleasure.\nNancy Spector\n",

This text found form in the seventh installment of Horn's ongoing book series To Place, a volume of photographs taken in northern Iceland. Unobstructed views of the ocean are interspersed with those shot through windows in the home of an elderly couple whose portraits appear throughout the book. They harvest the down from the nests of Eider ducks, and Horn includes images of the feathery nests. Outside influences infiltrate and become part of the continuum. Iceland had only one television station for years, and every afternoon many tuned in to watch the American soap opera, Guiding Light. Stills from this program punctuate the book Arctic Circles, marking the passage of time with the soothing recurrence of the same. Horn sets this mundane drama against the routine life cycles of birds in Iceland. Interspersed among this essay on coexistence are views of a taxidermied white owl. Here it embodies a collision of nature and culture, a haunting interruption in the entropic flow of life and death envisioned in this volume.For Pi, Arctic Circles migrated from the printed page to demarcate space, forming a frieze around a room. Unlike the sequential nature of a book, Horn's photographic installation promotes a triangulated spatial relationship between part, whole, and self that establishes an architecture of traversals and circumlocution. Every motif occurs at least twice, ideally three times. The seascape images are all split in two, with each half echoing its other somewhere in the room and, according to the artist, sewing this circular work together through memory and movement.\n",

A circular space that viewers can both circumambulate and enter, Link is designed as a kind of sanctuary. Each of the four videos within the structure projects images of Mori lying inert in her transparent Plexiglas body capsule against iconic vistas of thirteen different sites that represent three periods of human time: antiquity (the Giza pyramids), the present (Tokyo's Shibuya), and the future (the advanced megacity of Shanghai). Mori presents the viewer with a sense of time that defies linearity, giving form to the Buddhist concept of transmigration, wherein life and death are in constant states of mutual generation. The culmination of an important series of Mori's performance and photographic works that center on the body capsule performances, Link illustrates the major themes that have occupied the artist since her emergence in the early 1990s: the idea of the cyborg, the reinvention of ancient systems of spiritual knowledge for contemporary consumption, and more recently, the creation of an architecture of contemplative space.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nUta Barth's hazy photographs occupy the territory between abstraction and representation. Their lack of focus has become something of the artist's signature, and it often elicits comparisons between her work and that of such early-20th-century pictorialists as Gertrude Kasebier and Edward Steichen. In some regards this association is apt, especially when one considers the matte surfaces and heavy wooden backing of some of Barth's photographs, which emphasize their presence as objects. Moreover, as in pictorialist work, light evanescently illuminates many of Barth's scenes and subjects. For the most part, though, the fuzzy glow of her pictures far exceeds that of her predecessors' photographs. Barth renders landscapes and everyday spaces all but illegible by employing an extremely shallow depth of field. In doing so, she ruptures the age-old emphasis in photography on the referent and instead turns her audience toward its own experiences.As early as her series Field and Ground (both 199497), Barth began moving toward an emphasis on pure surface; often only the occasional detail could clue viewers into what they were seeing. In her  series nowhere near (1999), she offers a clearly rendered object: the panes of her living-room windows, through which she shoots the surrounding landscape. Yet windows exist not to be seen, but to be seen through. In focusing her lens on the glass itself rather than the view behind it, Barth highlights the conceptual underpinnings of all her work: an examination of the act of perception. When she enlarges some photographs to epic proportions and arranges them in diptychs or triptychs, Barth effectively overwhelms viewers with an acute awareness of their own processes of seeing, very often by confounding their understanding of what it is they see. In their banal beauty, her photographs hold a mirror up to the limits of perception itself.\n",

This suspension of time and causality lends Gaskell's images a remarkable ambiguity that she uses to evoke a vivid and dreamlike world.Gaskell's girls do not represent individuals, but act out the contradictions and desires of a single psyche. While their unity is suggested by their identical clothing, the mysterious and often cruel rituals they act out upon each other may be metaphors for disorientation and mental illness. In wonder and override, the character collectively evoked is Alice, perhaps lost in the Wonderland of her own mind, unable to determine whether the bizarre things happening to her are real or the result of her imagination. In wonder, Alice's instability is invoked even at the level of presentation: the varied sizes of the photographs refer to her own growth spurts and shrinking spells.

    "description": "\nDescription\nKaty Grannan relies on documentary photography as a point of reference in order to merge reality and fiction, while capturing the subtleties of her sitters' psychologies. To find subjects for her often unsettling photographs, Grannan has sought ordinary, nonprofessional models. In places such as upstate New York and Wisconsin, she placed a classified ad in local newspapers: Art models. Artist/photographer (female) seeks people for portraits. No experience necessary. Leave msg. The ad yielded two series of photographs, Dream America (2000) and The Poughkeepsie Journal (199899). Grannan's subjects posed for her in their own nonspecific, suburban American homes, complete with banal, often dingy furnishings and shopping-mall-purchased accessories. After arriving with only a fan, a light, and a camera, Grannan altered these settings by moving furniture and selecting a few props from around the house; sometimes people were photographed with their pets. Her process was swift and spontaneouseach portrait was completed within a period of three hours.Although people of varying ages replied to Grannan's ad, including couples and women who posed with their children, most of the images in The Poughkeepsie Journal depict young women in their late teens and early twenties, many photographed at their parents' homes. Often they are clad only in underwear or completely nude, shown in varying degrees of modesty and exposure. Grannan captures their desire to appeal to and entice viewers (including themselves and the photographer) while also eliciting a certain melancholy. As the figures of The Poughkeepsie Journal pose uneasily in their bedrooms and living rooms, they are captivatingly present, and indeed, what Grannan captures is the seductiveness of being photographed. These young women seem to be making a poignant effort to achieve a kind of sexiness, glamour, or independence that might transport them, if only momentarily, from the confines of their ordinary lives.\n",

The light from the window and dust gathering on the floor are enough; besides, its often what is hidden or nearly absent that we find most compelling. Using quiet, almost imperceptible means, Koo Jeong-A subtly intervenes in existing locations by altering the dimensions, ambience, and contents of a given space. Noticing one of her works might, for example, be contingent simply upon registering the sudden change of illumination in a room. Her installations and sculptures, which resemble miniature landscapes or suggest enigmatic narrative tableaux, are made from fragile and often unlikely materials: crumpled paper, discarded childrens toys, or hundreds of cigarettes neatly stacked in rows. The snowy-white contours of Oslo (1998), comprised of piles of crushed aspirin, are illuminated by a spotlight, like mountain peaks beneath a cold, northern light. Another delicate work constructed from sugar cubes and cardboard is small enough to rest on a window sill, while others, like Oslo, despite taking up a mere corner of the physical space, can occupy an entire room by virtue of their very quietude.Meghan Dailey\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nSince the late 1990s, Milan-based artist Armin Linke has traversed the globe, traveling over five continents to compile a vast photographic atlas of the contemporary world. From Brasilia to Baghdad to Bangkok, Linke has turned his camera to both natural and man-made environments. His subjects range from mountains, glaciers, rainforests, and barren plains; to rapidly growing megacities, and the massive interiors of hotels and industrial plants; to iconic institutional spaces such as the United Nations building and Star City in Moscow. Interested in the relationship between mankind and nature, Linke has often examined those places where the two intersect. Power and energy stations recur in his work, as do massive engineering projects such as the construction of the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in China. While his expanding archive cumulatively chronicles the effects of development and globalization, Linke's photographs are distinct from photojournalistic images. Generally focusing upon the places rather than their inhabitants, they remain nonnarrative and open-ended. When human beings do appear, they are usually dwarfed in relation to the enormous, awe-inspiring scale of the natural or artificial surroundings.\nLinke is regularly drawn to scenes that blur the border between fact and fiction. The selection of works that is reproduced in his catalogue Transient (2003) begins with a miniature model of the Alps from the Ecole polytechnique federale in Lausanne, Switzerlandits true scale and origin only discernible from the captionand ends with a photograph that Linke took at the actual North Pole, a nearly monochromatic field of white that appears almost less real by comparison. For Ski Dome, Tokyo, Japan (1998), a work from his series Global Box (19982000), Linke photographed a gigantic indoor ski slope in Japan.1 Over the past decade, a number of such artificial snow resorts have been built in Asia and Europe, enabling year-round winter recreation; in 2005, SkiDubai opened its doors in the Middle East, offering a simulated experience of the North to desert residents. Linke captures the Tokyo structure's immense interior in a large-scale, panoramic format that recalls historical landscape painting. Rather than open sky, the massive, icy slope with its diminutive figures is jarringly spanned by a vast vaulted ceiling with electric lights. As in many of Linke's works, the photograph suggests the effects of rapid technological and commercial development upon the natural world. In this case, snow (and the entire winter landscape with all of its attendant mystery and romance) has been tamed and packaged as yet another commodity in a burgeoning global leisure industry.\n1. The Tokyo Ski Dome, SSAWS (an acronym for \"Spring Summer Autumn Winter Snow\") opened in 1993. After financial losses, it closed in 2002 and was dismantled the following year. Linke also photographed an exterior view of the center.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nInigo Manglano-Ovalle has created a diverse body of work that comprises installation-based practices, photography, sculpture, and community-based projects. Filtering his subject matter through the lens of modernity, he explores a broad range of issuessuch as representation and identity, new technologies, and structures of powerand simultaneously reexamines modernist theories and strategies. Manglano-Ovalle mines the often detached, cool logic of modernism and abstract formalism in order to reach a more expansive and inclusive treatment of social and individual realities. Seemingly neutral and clinical realms of science, such as climatology and genomic mapping, are problematized and engaged as form and content in his work. The assumptions of those fields and their implications in creating or reifying social hierarchies slowly and subtly emerge in the artist's ambitious projects.The video installation Climate (2000) has a tripartite structurein both narrative and formand reflects Manglano-Ovalle's interest in exploring simultaneity. The piece also demonstrates his insistence on drawing viewers in to engage directly, and thus be implicated in, the space of the installation rather than simply interacting as contemplative onlookers. The three separate videos in Climate were filmed in Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's sleekly modernist Lake Shore Drive Apartments (194951) in Chicago, and examine the assumptions of International Style architecture within the framework of today's increasingly globalized society. In this work, surveillance technology, assault weapons, and people waiting suggest a chilling world without boundaries in which nature has been dominated by a sterile, detached precision.The DNA portraits by Manglano-Ovalle engage the formalist arguments of modernist art critic Clement Greenberg and the aesthetics of the Post-painterly abstraction he championed. Manglano-Ovalle's seemingly abstract color print Glenn, Dario, and Tyrone (from The Garden of Delights [1998]), is in fact a photograph of three individuals' DNA samples. For the series, the artist asked sixteen individuals to take part, each selecting two others with whom he or she would like to be represented in a triptych portrait. With this introduction of self-determination, Manglano-Ovalle allowed his participants to create and define their own network of relationships and make choices about the representation of family.Manglano-Ovalle's engagement with issues of typology, genealogy, and racial makeup extend beyond the recent issues that DNA technologies have raised, taking in part his inspiration from Hieronymus Bosch's painting The Garden of Earthly Delights (150510), and the fantastic grotesqueries that emerged from Bosch's imaginary mixed couplings. Manglano-Ovalle was also interested in these issues as they are represented in Spanish colonial casta (caste) paintings. A taxonomy of the racial mixing of Spaniards, Indians, and Africans, the casta paintings were meant to impose a hierarchy of race and class in a rapidly hybridizing New World. Manglano-Ovalle problematizes issues of representation, objectification, and social control in his contemporary portraits.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nCatherine Opie counts such documentary photographers as Eugene Atget, August Sander, Berenice Abbott, Walker Evans, Lewis Hine, and Dorothea Lange among her greatest historical influences. In fact, she described herself in a 1994 Los Angeles Times article as a kind of twisted social documentary photographer. Long before earning her MFA at the California Institute of the Arts in 1988, she found that photography was perfectly suited to her drive to describe the world and people around hera drive that unifies all her projects to date, whether focused on gender and sexual identities, notions of community, or the myth of the American dream.Opie's first well-known series, Being and Having (1991), consists of headshots of Opie's female friends sporting false facial hair to suggest the fluidity and complexity of gender. She followed this in the mid-1990s with the Portraits series, in which she photographed transgender women and men, drag queens, and leather dykes with great solemnity and formality, thereby using historical norms of studio portraiture to upend heterosexual norms of identity and sexuality. Although for many viewers these subjects represent the exotic other, Opie's photographs visually resist such simplistic voyeurism through their controlled composition, regal poses, and lush studio backdrops.Throughout her career, Opie has photographed the landscape around her with the same dignity and elegance, capturing the arc of a deserted strip of freeway or the commonplace stretch of a mini-mall in Los Angeles. Each photograph retains the trace of a human presence, suggesting that the space need only be repopulated to serve its purpose, to ward off decay. In 1998, Opie traveled cross-country in her motor home for two months in order to photograph lesbian couples. This series, called Domesticof which Melissa &amp; Lake, Durham, North Carolina is an examplepresents these couples involved in everyday, household activities: relaxing in their backyard, hanging out in their kitchen, playing with their children. There is no sensationalism here. Much like the formal studio portraits before them, these intimate photographs speak both to Opie's identification with her subjects and to the overwhelming absence of such images in mainstream representations.\n",

In his own exhibitions, he often employs sculpture, drawing, photography, installation, and video and recycles older work into sometimes new mediums and contexts. The readymade is central to Orozco's process. He frequently manipulates what he discovers by arranging found materials (a deflated soccer ball, cans of cat food, simple planks of wood) and photographing his constructions. Sometimes he transforms the ordinary just by suggesting a form in a seemingly banal image, as in Pulpo (Octopus, 1991), which bestows meaning on a tangle of pipes. Here the readymade is not so much a thing found as a dynamic and poetic interaction between artist and object.Orozco plays photography and sculpture off against one another to create compelling hybrids in the service of his interest in the lightening of mass. This involves streamlining or hollowing out objects that at first appear heavy and cumbersome, as in the sculpture La DS (1993, pronounced like la deesse, French for goddess), a trisected Citroen automobile seamlessly reassembled without the middle section. In Dos Parejas (Two Couples, 1990), heavy industrial objects are playfully anthropomorphized by their title as their sculptural mass is negated through photographic reproduction. In Photogravity (1999), Orozco mounted large versions of his old photographs on spindly legs to produce a sort of two-dimensional sculpture. He uses one medium to expose another's limits: photography can strip sculpture of its mass, but it always lacks the real thing that it pictures.Orozco's photographs document chance encounters with sites and objects in his native Mexico and other locations around the world, including Brazil, Germany, Iceland, India, and New York.

Under the collective banner of the Atlas Group, an imaginary research foundation based in New York and Beirut, Raad has exhibited, published, and lectured upon a growing body of photographs, texts, films, and videos that purport to chronicle Lebanon's protracted civil war of 197590. The documentary material that comprises the Atlas Group Archive is of dubious provenance, sourced to anonymous individuals or characters of questionable authenticity. Even when attributed to Raad himself, as in the work from this series, the documents freely blend fact and fiction in a way that suggests the highly subjective and contested nature of historical memory. Here, photographs of Beirut's bombed out and bullet-pocked infrastructure are overlaid with brightly colored dots. The accompanying text explains that the artist collected used shells embedded in buildings in Beirut in the early 1980s and catalogued their locations in his notebooks. Years later, upon discovering that arms manufacturers color code their shells, he realized that he had amassed an inventory of the devastation indirectly wrought by the seventeen countries who had supplied the various factions of the war. The actual veracity of the story is almost irrelevant; as Raad has described them, such fabricated documentsfantasies erected from the material of collective memoriesoffer the potential for communicating larger historical truths.\n",

In his photo-based works, Richter combines various tropes of painting and photography to create a kind of representational problem: how and when does the eye sense the difference between a painted surface and the photographically recorded? In Richter's seemingly conventional yet large-scale Seestuck (Seascape, 1998), the pigment is thinly applied, resulting in a surface that emulates the flatness of a photograph. And, like a snapshot might be, it is blurred. Here, the visual becomes conceptual, as Richter literally obscures the distinction between the photographic and the painted. Seascape, which also recalls the moody, atmospheric landscapes of German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich, is the first work by Richter to enter Bilbao's collection.Meghan Dailey\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nShortly before entering art school, Elizabeth Charlotte Rist took the name Pipilotti, combining her childhood nickname, Lotti, with Pippi Longstocking, the heroine of the Swedish childrens book series. Rists identification with the girl-adventurera playful yet fiercely independent orphan who possesses magical strengthpoints to several features of her work: her ready borrowing from popular culture, whimsical exploration of the fantastic, and unconventional approach to female subjectivity.Since emerging in the mid-1980s, Rist has drawn as much from the language of the mass media as she has from first-generation video artists like Nam June Paik. In particular, the saturated colors, hallucinatory effects, and prominent sound tracks of her works have elicited comparisons to the language of music videos. While exploiting the sensuous qualities of the medium, however, Rist eschews popular conventions of narrative and spectatorship, especially in the way that she presents her female subjects. Sip My Ocean (1996), a video projected as two mirrored reflections on adjoining walls, offers a kaleidoscopic view of an idyllic underwater paradise, with a flowing sequence of dreamlike images, including intermittent close-ups of a bikini-clad woman floating and swimming through the waves along with views of various domestic objects sinking to the seabed. The implicit voyeurism and exaggerated hyperfeminity of such images are complicated by the accompanying sound track, in which the artists rendition of Chris Isaacs melancholy pop song Wicked Game is punctuated by her repeated shrieking of the lyrics I dont want to fall in love. Although she denies having an explicitly feminist agenda, Rist frequently merges eroticism and coquettishness with aggression and hysteria to produce provocative fantasies of female empowerment. Moving beyond the conventional format of the screen or gallery wall, Rist has often projected her videos in unusual ways, manipulating scale, context, and viewing position to uncanny ends. Atmosphere &amp; Instinct (1998), for instance, comprises a small projection onto the floor, in which a childlike woman, clad in a Raggedy Annstyle dress and wig, is seen from a birds-eye view. Moving in and out of sight through the leafy treetops, past suburban homes, swimming pools, and lawn chairs, she looks up and waves her arms with the desire to be seen or perhaps to fly away; the work takes on a melancholic tone when that desire promises to be unfulfilled. On a wholly opposite scale, Himalayas Sisters Living Room (2000) features a variety of moving images within a fully immersive environment. In this workone of a series of pieces in which Rist has explored the domestic spacethe viewer is invited to move through a dimly lit interior cluttered with furniture and objects from different eras, some of which are uncannily animated by videos cast from hidden projectors: on a side table, the artist presses her face against a windowpane; a liquor bottle atop a 1950s-era bar glows with a soccer game. Rist has noted that the moving picture itself is always a room within another room. Just as she employs video to explore the interiority of her female characters, here she uses projections to penetrate inanimate objects, uncovering the thoughts and memories embedded within the traditionally feminized, collective space of the household.Ted Mann\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAndreas Slominski is part of a generation of German artists that emerged during the late 1980s and early 1990s to counter the monumentalizing historicism of Neo-Expressionist painting and sculpture. And like many artists of this generation, Slominski favors the accumulation of conceptually interrelated pieces and performative actions over the discrete artwork. He has been working with the concept of \"trapping\" for more than 15 years, creating a veritable arsenal of such objects ranging from elaborate snares to beguiling decoys. His trapswhich operate as both sculpture and functional objectsallude metaphorically to the deceptive and seductive nature of art.Bird Trapping Station is an interpretation of a traditional trapping compound complete with a two-story, catching hut (for the trap setter) and a series of \"double clap\" nets, baited and ready to be sprung shut. Cords connecting each set of hinged nets to the hut lie slack, but are poised to be yanked by the trap setter should a bird land within the confines of any of the compartments. Slominskis trap-as-sculpture (or sculpture-as-trap) is intensely paradoxical, for it brings its status as art into question through its very presence in the museum. If not confined to these rarefied atmospheres, where function is sacrificed for aesthetics, his traps could easily fulfill their original purpose out in the fields. Slominski does not purchase these items as already-existing, found objects. After careful research, he has highly-specialized traps constructed for the sole purpose of being exhibited. Therefore, the distinctions between the readymade as an item plucked from the real world; an artwork fashioned to replicate aspects of the real world; and something real produced to function only as an art object are more than semantic. Slominski situates the meaning of his work in the confusion of whether the objects are traps or sculptures; is he an artist who makes traps or a trap setter who makes art?Slominskis objects and performative gestures reveal a sense of the absurd, and the simplest, most mundane tasks are carried out with a fanatical attention to detail. Cough Syrup Transport System, a scientifically-designed calibration device that counters the vibrations caused by any movement, makes it possible for someone to travel with just one dose of cough syrup without spilling a drop of the liquid. Despite the wonderfully preposterous nature of this invention, this is an artwork about comfort and security. Created in consultation with an expert in transportation technology for sensitive materials at the Technische Universitat Berlin, the mechanism is not about technological ingenuity, but rather, it is a testament to reassurance.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMoving freely from one genre to another, intermingling them in exhibitions and publications, Thomas Struth brings an intense level of visual exactitude to the images he creates. While the subject matter variesfrom a mist-laden view of a Japanese temple and a close-up of a sunflower to a pensive family portrait and a picture of the Louvre crowded with visitorsthe fundamental theme of his practice does not change. Struth's photography contemplates the science of observation. Eschewing narrative devices and intentional psychological allusions, the work augments vision itself by bringing into focus details too numerous for the eye to capture in an instant. A Struth image does not freeze time in the conventional sense of documentary photography; instead it slows time down just enough to capture the myriad visual nuances that one can only experience through sustained examination.Struth's early black-and-white cityscapesimages of barren urban streets photographed from one central perspectiveelicit comparisons to Bernd and Hilla Becher's typological studies of industrial structures. Struth had studied with the couple at the Academy of Fine Arts in Dusseldorf during the 1970s and shared their systematic, objective approach to subject matter. But it was another of Struth's professors at the Academy, Gerhard Richter, who made a lasting impression on the young artist's work. Richter's conceptual engagement with the photographic and his practice of working in simultaneous series is evident in Struth's own ongoing series of landscapes, street scenes, flowers, portraits, museum interiors, and places of worship. The Richter Family I, Cologne is a penetrating depiction of the artist's former mentor with his wife and young children.Struth's photographs of historic churches and temples, which function today as both religious sites and tourist destinations, always include people. Like his museum interiors, images of places such as San Zaccaria in Venice and the Buddhist monastery Todai-Ji in Nara, Japan, portray visitors in various stages of absorption. In Milan Cathedral (Interior), these visitors turn away from the camera to survey their environment, observe the Renaissance paintings, study their guidebooks, or pray. Shot at an oblique angle and lit with the utmost clarity, this dynamic composition captures both the complexity of the cathedral's celebrated architecture and the many separate vignettes being enacted by the individuals present at the moment the photograph was taken.\n",

Shu Lea Cheang's 1998 work Brandon is a multifaceted web project that uses the nonlinear and participatory nature of the Internet as a means to explore and illuminate Brandon Teena's tragic story. From the opening image of morphing gender signifiers, Cheang propels the viewer into a probing investigation of human sexuality. It is an inquiry that utilizes hyperlinked images of a disembodied human form, once-live chat rooms on the subject of crime and punishment, and graphic moving images in order to illuminate the wide-reaching effect of Brandon's life and death. Exploiting the highly mutable \"skin\" of the Internet, Cheang reveals how this emerging virtual environment enables individuals to inhabit and play with different gender roles and characters. A prime example of \"cyberfeminism,\" Brandon utilizes technology as a means to break down social assumptions about gender in both the realm of technology and in society at large.\nOriginally presented in conjunction with the Society for Old and New Media (DeWaag) in the Netherlands, Brandon was not only a website, but for one year also served as a social and academic space through which a broad audience communicated both casually and as participants in a number of organized events. Staged in physical spaces but broadcast and represented online, two notable events, \"Digi Gender Social Body: Under the Knife, Under the Spell of Anesthesia\" and \"Would the Jurors Please Stand Up,\" blurred the distinctions between online and offline platforms and highlighted the far-reaching capabilities of the early Internet.\nNotable for being the Guggenheim Museum's first official engagement with the then-emerging medium of Internet art and one of the first works of this medium commissioned by a major institution, Brandon is often cited as a watershed moment for the movement and for its important place in the history of contemporary art.\nCaitlin Jones\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nRobert Gober's rich and unsettling iconographyfrom dysfunctional sinks and handcrafted furniture to truncated body parts and storm drainshas unfolded sequentially over the past 25 years. Each new work has seemed unprecedented and startlingly fresh in its bold narrative form. But much of his innovative vocabulary was already articulated in his early Slides of a Changing Painting (198283), which documents the permutations of a single canvas that he altered over a year's time, photographing each modification until he had thousands of individual records. Whittled down to 89 slides, it functions today as a key to Gober's practice. Projected in sequence, the images morph into one another, revealing a transformative process at work: a human body becomes a landscape and then an architectural interior, stairs descend a man's chest into a basement, a culvert pipe diverts a stream across a torso. Water is pervasive throughout; it cascades down a mountainside and pours forth from cantilevered drainpipes. This early investigation led to the artist's ghostly sculptural sinks, which were painstakingly handcrafted to resemble pearly white porcelain structures. In Backsplash, Gober focused on the featureless slab that forms the back wall of the sink, reducing it to a spare, minimal form that is rendered almost unrecognizable, yet retains a disorienting familiarity.The culvert pipe was not realized in sculptural form until 1994, when Gober began three enigmatic works: an oversize box of tissues penetrated by a metal pipe, an armchair impaled by the same type of pipe, and a huge box of lard divided by a cruciform of pipes. The artist revisited this sculptural equation and its intimations of sexual aggression in his 1997 installation that included a life-size Madonna figure pierced through the center by a culvert pipea complex, haunting symbol amid an environment of running water and storm drains.In Untitled, a six-foot culvert pipe uncannily and inexplicably penetrates a willow basket, again creating a surreal image that links motifs in Gober's oeuvre. The oversize basket, handwoven by the artist, harks back to his dog beds of the mid-1980s, their pillows imprinted with quaint yet menacing images of geese and stags, favored prey of hunting canines. Those works' gothic connotations resonate in the present sculpture, particularly in its pierced state. It is interesting to note that Gober's initial concept for his 1997 installationin which the secular, sacred, and psychological are fusedinvolved the placement of a large, woven basket in the center of the gallery, the space eventually occupied by the Virgin Mary.\n",

Slominski does not purchase these items as already-existing, found objects. After careful research, he has highly-specialized traps constructed for the sole purpose of being exhibited. Therefore, the distinctions between the readymade as an item plucked from the real world; an artwork fashioned to replicate aspects of the real world; and something real produced to function only as an art object are more than semantic. Slominski situates the meaning of his work in the confusion of whether the objects are traps or sculptures; is he an artist who makes traps or a trap setter who makes art?Slominskis objects and performative gestures reveal a sense of the absurd, and the simplest, most mundane tasks are carried out with a fanatical attention to detail. Cough Syrup Transport System, a scientifically-designed calibration device that counters the vibrations caused by any movement, makes it possible for someone to travel with just one dose of cough syrup without spilling a drop of the liquid. Despite the wonderfully preposterous nature of this invention, this is an artwork about comfort and security. Created in consultation with an expert in transportation technology for sensitive materials at the Technische Universitat Berlin, the mechanism is not about technological ingenuity, but rather, it is a testament to reassurance.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMatthew Barney's CREMASTER cycle (19942002) is a self-enclosed aesthetic system consisting of five feature-length films that explore processes of creation. The cycle unfolds not just cinematically but also through the photographs, drawings, sculptures, and installations the artist produces in conjunction with each episode. Its conceptual departure point is the male cremaster muscle, which controls testicular contractions in response to external stimuli. The project is rife with anatomical allusions to the position of the reproductive organs during the embryonic process of sexual differentiation: CREMASTER 1 (1995) represents the most \"ascended\" or undifferentiated state; CREMASTER 5 (1997), the most \"descended\" or differentiated. The cycle repeatedly returns to those moments during early sexual development in which the outcome of the process is still unknownin Barney's metaphoric universe, these moments represent a condition of pure potentiality.CREMASTER 1 takes place in the Bronco Stadium in Boise, Idaho. The film parodies the musical extravaganzas of Busby Berkeley as filtered through the lens of Leni Riefenstahl's Third Reich athletics. Chorus girls form outlines of reproductive organs on a football field, their movements determined from above by a starlet, who inhabits two blimps simultaneously and creates anatomical diagrams by lining up rows of grapes. CREMASTER 2 (1999) alternates between the Columbia Icefield in Canada and the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. It is a gothic Western premised loosely on the real-life story of Gary Gilmore, who was executed in Utah for murder. Gilmore's biography is conveyed through a series of fantastic sequences, including a seance to signify his conception and a prison rodeo staged in a cast-salt arena to represent his death by firing squad. CREMASTER 3 (2002) is part zombie thriller, part gangster film. As the final installment completed in the series, the film is a distillation of Barney's major themes, filtered through a symbolic matrix involving Freemasonry, Celtic lore, and coded references to the CREMASTER cycle itself. Set in New York's Chrysler Building, CREMASTER 3 also includes detours to the Guggenheim Museum, to the harness track in Saratoga Springs, and to Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. CREMASTER 4 (1994) is set on the Isle of Man, where a motorbike race traverses the landscape, a tap-dancing satyr writhes his way through an underwater canal, and three fairies picnic on a grassy knoll. Part vaudeville, part Victorian comedy of manners, and part road movie, this film portrays sheer drive in its struggle to surpass itself. Set in Budapest, CREMASTER 5 is performed as an opera complete with Jacobin pigeons, a lovelorn queen, and her tragic hero. The narrative flows from the Hungarian State Opera House to the Gellert Baths, which is inhabited by water sprites frolicking in a pool of pearls. As the cycle's concluding chapter, the film traces the story of final release, a physical transcendence that is misunderstood and mourned as loss.\n",

As with artists James Casebere and Thomas Demand, Boberg's models are created for the sole purpose of being photographed; they are three-dimensional sculptures meticulously designed to function as two-dimensional images. While this work is connected to the architectural photography of Bernd and Hilla Becher, these inheritors of this largely German tradition have increasingly turned their attention to issues of photographic veracity. If a real object in real space can be recorded in such a way as to evoke a completely different subject and place, then the issue raised is that of perception, of the expectations the viewer brings to a given photograph. Boberg's suggestion is that we approach images with models of what we expect to see already in mind, models that photographs merely confirm, models like the ones that the artist constructs.In the work Night Sites (Nacht-Orte, 200203), Boberg turned to film to investigate and subvert the experience of cinematic absorption. Each of the seven 16-mm films that make up this piece is a continuous loop of an \"establishing shot\" of a rural site in which nothing happens, save the film's ambient sound track. Since these establishing shots do not turn out to be setups for the following shots of a story, as one might have anticipated, the viewer is instead left with the awareness of his or her own inflated expectations about the medium at hand.Despite his pictures' artificiality, Boberg is able to create a remarkable sense of atmosphere. The absence of people in the drab entranceway to a building depicted in Passage (1999) is made ominous by the movement from light to dark, from outside to the edge of inside within the photograph. The uniformity and rigid geometries the artist chooses may reference, and critique, the attempted universality of German postwar architecture. In Boberg's hands these idealized structures are shown at their most hackneyed and seem to fall victim to wear and decay.

Over 30 feet high, the mammoth sculpture is one of the most ambitious undertakings in the long career of Louse Bourgeois. Over a vast oeuvre spanning more than sixty years, Bourgeois plumbed the depths of human emotion further and more passionately than perhaps any other artist of her time. In its evocation of the psyche, her work is both universal and deeply personal, with frequent, explicit reference to painful childhood memories of an unfaithful father and a loving but complicit mother. Bourgeois first gained notice in the 1940s with her Surrealist-inspired Personnages (194555): thin, vertical forms in wood or stone that evoke the human body. Installed in clusters, suggesting a small crowd or perhaps a family, the Personnages were meant to symbolize figures from the artist's past. Maman, in fact, is associated with the artist's own mother. The spider, who protects her precious eggs in a steel cage-like body, provokes awe and fear, but her massive height, improbably balanced on slender legs, conveys an almost poignant vulnerability.Meghan Dailey\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the years around 1980, Francesco Clemente was one of a group of young Italian painters who broke free from the sterile abstraction of Minimalism and the humble materialism of Arte Povera, movements that had pronounced painting, especially figurative painting, a dead medium. The painting revivalidentified as the Transavanguardia by critic Achille Bonito Olivathat began in Italy sparked an international stylistic shift that persisted throughout the 1980s and involved artists such as Georg Baselitz, Anselm Kiefer, and Julian Schnabel. Also known as Neo-Expressionism, this movement revitalized painting and brought back individual expression by using sensuous color, gestural technique, narrative content, and the human figure on a grand scale.Scissors and Butterflies, although from a later stage in Clementes oeuvre, exemplifies the most sensual and visually forceful aspects of this style. The painting reveals recurrent themes in Clementes work: a sense of the exotic; explicit sexual imagery; and metamorphoses between human and animal forms. The eyelashes of the female figures have been transformed into elongated insect antennae, echoing the sharp, curving forms of the scissors blades. Individual limbs are difficult to distinguish as the womens writhing bodies merge with and seem to penetrate each other. The pervasive sense of anxiety and violenceaccentuated by the open scissorsintensify the compositions eroticism, as does the heated red and electric green palette. A radical take on the three graces, Clementes provocative nudes are more than a fanciful trio in a dreamlike setting. At once feminine and masculine, whimsical and savage, passive and hostile, these muses transgress traditional boundaries.Clementes metaphoric vocabulary is deeply rooted in the body, and the artists many variations on the human form indicate its primacy as a symbol for how he envisions the world. Representing both wholeness and fragmentation, freedom and constriction, the body is Clementes ultimate vehicle for expressing lifes dualities, especially in the many portraits and self-portraits produced throughout his career. In this painting, the fragile delicacy of butterfly wings is juxtaposed with the womens salacious positions and the sharp, menacing scissors. As in much of Clementes work, bodily orificeseyes and genitalsare prominent. For him, these sensitive regions serve as channels between the interior realm of the psyche and the exterior world of nature, culture, and the other. An artist with close ties to Italy, America, and India, Clemente has always used the influence of foreign cultures to explore the interface between self and surroundings.Bridget Alsdorf\r\n        ",

His elaborately staged panoramas often elicit comparisons to the films of Alfred Hitchcock, David Lynch, and Steven Spielberg. Although he eschews the clarity of narrative film, Crewdson engages with his material as a director might, going to great lengths to construct fictional realms, recently employing a crew of up to thirty-five to help realize his cinematic visions.In Crewdson's work, meaning is kept just out of reach, where it lurks like a repressed trauma. His early Natural Wonder series (199297) focused on wildlifebirds, worms, and insectsforced to the edges of suburbia. These scenes take on the air of mysterious rituals. In one photograph, several birds have created a circular clearing in the grass and lined it with their speckled eggs, over which they stand guard. In another image, dozens of butterflies converge in a frenzied mass, smothering whatever lies beneath them. These ambiguous activities go entirely unnoticed by people, although a human presence is often suggested in the photographs by placid houses in the background. In his series Hover (199697), Crewdson turns to the human realm and explores its darker aspects. Abandoning the close-up views of Natural Wonder for higher, more expansive camera angles, these black-and-white photographs offer glimpses into private backyard sanctums in which disturbing acts occur: a man kneels over a woman who has collapsed and is inexplicably bound by festive balloons; elsewhere, a man obsessively mows his lawn in ever-larger concentric circles.Crewdson's most recent series, Twilight (19982002), returns to those uncanny suburban motifs, staging them in a more elaborate manner.

In Untitled (pregnant woman/pool) (1999), a woman stands in a small inflatable swimming pool as celestial beams of light shine prophetically on her pregnant belly.

They share physical space but are emotionally lost to one another.

Dressed as a Napoleonic courier, she rode into the crowded gallery on a white horse to deliver a message of surrender. If it need be termed surrender, then let it be so, for he has surrendered in word, not will. He has said, 'My fall will be great but it will be useful.' The emperor has fallen and he rests his weight upon your mind and mine and with this I am electric. I am electric.\" Having uttered this rather rebellious declaration of defeat, Donnelly turned and exited the gallery, leaving her guests to ponder the equally cryptic installation of video, photographs, and drawings comprising her show. Donnelly's is an art of nonsequiturs. The logic that connects her live performances with her objects and installations is entirely her own. She creates privately coded belief systems that communicate through the power of her expressions and gestures.Whether live or recorded on video, these performances invite the spectator to navigate their elusive narratives by accepting the terms of the artists own private language. In a recent video projection Canadian Rain (2002), Donnelly created rain in Canada by repeatedly executing gestures from an entirely invented sign language. Similarly, in an earlier video performance, she described how to find the most beautiful spot on Earth using only her imaginary signing system. In the silent video untitled (jumping) (1999), Donnelly reenacts what she contends are the signature gestures of specific rock musicians at the moment they achieve their performance wallthe point when they reach physical transcendence through their music. By jumping on an unseen trampoline, she floats in and out of the frame in slow motion, assuming a dreamlike state and re-creating the musicians' adrenaline-induced moments of ecstasy. The identities of the different performersfrom Ozzy Osbourne to Joey Ramoneare never revealed.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWhere can we draw the line between nature and culture? And how do we as individuals fit into the relationship between the two? Since the early 1990s Olafur Eliasson has been making installations and series of photographs that consistently address such questions. His works consider the problems of representing and perceiving natural phenomena. To make them, he has constructed a waterfall in a museum courtyard, grown edible mushrooms on rotting tree trunks, and cut a hole in a gallery roof, allowing a disk of sunlight to move across the floor. Each process is put in motion through basic mechanisms and simple materialssunlight, water, ordinary garden hosesthat are plainly visible to spectators. The processes can unfold very slowly, allowing viewers time to contemplate what Eliasson characterizes as a discrepancy between the experience of seeing and the knowledge or expectation of what we are seeing.By re-creating natural phenomena within or around artificial sites, Eliasson exposes moments of disjuncture between reality and representation. In this context, his use of photography is apt. As a medium, photography is especially relevant to explorations of the dialectic between nature and artifice, representation and reality. Eliasson considers his photographs as sketches for his installations and does not exhibit the two bodies of work together. Usually arranged in a grid format, these landscape studies show natural phenomena, such as rivers, caves, and glaciers, mostly in Iceland. Eliasson intentionally selects points of view that highlight viewers' bodily relations to the pictured scenes, choosing disembodied aerial shots or close-ups that reinforce the artist's own presence. When exhibited as a series, the individual images create a cumulative sense of the terrain and the slow progression of geological activity, such as glaciers melting or continental plates shifting. Eliasson ultimately foregrounds our own presence in the face of these colossal changes, and his re-creations and interventions upon natural phenomena are a means of investigating perception itself.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAnna Gaskell crafts foreboding photographic tableaux of preadolescent girls that reference children's games, literature, and psychology. She is interested in isolating dramatic moments from larger plots such as Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, visible in two series: wonder (199697) and override (1997). In Gaskell's style of narrative photography, of which Cindy Sherman is a pioneer, the image is carefully planned and staged; the scene presented is artificial in that it exists only to be photographed. While this may be similar to the process of filmmaking, there is an important difference. Gaskell's photographs are not tied together by a linear thread; it is as though their events all take place simultaneously, in an ever-present. Each image's before and after are lost, allowing possible interpretations to multiply. In untitled #9 of the wonder series, a wet bar of soap has been dragged along a wooden floor. In untitled #17 it appears again, forced into a girl's mouth, with no explanation of how or why. This suspension of time and causality lends Gaskell's images a remarkable ambiguity that she uses to evoke a vivid and dreamlike world.Gaskell's girls do not represent individuals, but act out the contradictions and desires of a single psyche. While their unity is suggested by their identical clothing, the mysterious and often cruel rituals they act out upon each other may be metaphors for disorientation and mental illness. In wonder and override, the character collectively evoked is Alice, perhaps lost in the Wonderland of her own mind, unable to determine whether the bizarre things happening to her are real or the result of her imagination. In wonder, Alice's instability is invoked even at the level of presentation: the varied sizes of the photographs refer to her own growth spurts and shrinking spells. Gaskell's allusions to Carroll's story, however, are not always so playful. The seven versions of Alice in override alternate roles as victim or aggressor. They try to control the changes to Alice's body by literally, physically holding her in placea potent metaphor for the anxiety and confusion experienced by children on the verge of adolescence. hide (1998) derives from a Brothers Grimm tale of a young woman who disguises herself under an animal pelt so that she might escape her own father's proposal of marriage. Gaskell addresses this psychologically loaded subject matter with images of girls wandering in a gothic mansion illuminated by candlelight. Here the psyche in question has been fractured and fraught with terror by a perverse father's look, a voyeuristic gaze.\n",

Mistaken identities, doubles, split personalities, and such opposites as good and evil, and self and other are thematized as inseparable. Gordon's films, video installations, photographs, and texts transform differences into uncanny, nuanced pairs.Gordon approaches film as ready-made or found object, mining the potential collective memory that exists in cinematic fragments, and in the process, disclosing unseen or overlooked details and associations. His installation through a looking glass (1999) features the well-known scene from Martin Scorsese's 1976 film Taxi Driver in which Travis Bickle, played by Robert De Niro, asks, You talkin' to me? while gazing into a mirror. In Gordons piece, the scene is projected onto dual screens placed on opposite walls of a gallery space. The original episode from the movie, filmed as a reflection in the mirror, is shown on one wall. The other screen displays the same episode with the image reversed, flipped left to right. The two facing images, which begin in sync, progressively fall out of step, echoing the character's loss of control and his mental breakdown. These discordant projected images seem to respond to one another, thus trapping the viewer in the crossfire. In its almost dizzying play of dualities, through a looking glass perfectly articulates the dialectical inversions, doublings, and repetitions that are the central concerns of Gordon's work.Gordon also uses still photography to capture performative acts, as in Tattoo (for Reflection) (1997). In accordance with Gordon's instructions, the writer Oscar van den Boogaard had the word guilty tattooed in reverse on the back of his left shoulder; the tattoo can only be read via its reflection in a mirror. Gordon revels in the mixed messages found in the tattoo's various cultural associations, from its use as an identifying mark on prisoners to its current incarnation as a subculture status symbol. In true Gordonian, reflexive fashionwith the word legible on van den Boogaards back only when reversedthe photograph becomes an index of an index.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nKaty Grannan relies on documentary photography as a point of reference in order to merge reality and fiction, while capturing the subtleties of her sitters' psychologies. To find subjects for her often unsettling photographs, Grannan has sought ordinary, nonprofessional models. In places such as upstate New York and Wisconsin, she placed a classified ad in local newspapers: Art models. Artist/photographer (female) seeks people for portraits. No experience necessary. Leave msg. The ad yielded two series of photographs, Dream America (2000) and The Poughkeepsie Journal (199899). Grannan's subjects posed for her in their own nonspecific, suburban American homes, complete with banal, often dingy furnishings and shopping-mall-purchased accessories. After arriving with only a fan, a light, and a camera, Grannan altered these settings by moving furniture and selecting a few props from around the house; sometimes people were photographed with their pets. Her process was swift and spontaneouseach portrait was completed within a period of three hours.Although people of varying ages replied to Grannan's ad, including couples and women who posed with their children, most of the images in The Poughkeepsie Journal depict young women in their late teens and early twenties, many photographed at their parents' homes. Often they are clad only in underwear or completely nude, shown in varying degrees of modesty and exposure. Grannan captures their desire to appeal to and entice viewers (including themselves and the photographer) while also eliciting a certain melancholy. As the figures of The Poughkeepsie Journal pose uneasily in their bedrooms and living rooms, they are captivatingly present, and indeed, what Grannan captures is the seductiveness of being photographed. These young women seem to be making a poignant effort to achieve a kind of sexiness, glamour, or independence that might transport them, if only momentarily, from the confines of their ordinary lives.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAndreas Gurskys photographic vision is extraordinarily precise. Every imagewhether of a Rhine landscape, rave dance floor, or factory interior unfolds to reveal an intrinsic organizing principle. Teasing an eccentric geometry out of each of his subjects, Gursky reorders the world according to his own visual logic, accumulating myriad tiny details to offer a sense of harmonic coherence. There is a documentary impulse behind Gurskys work, one inherited from his German forebearsAugust Sander, the early 20th-century encyclopedic chronicler of occupational typologies, and his own professors, Bernd and Hilla Becher, who systematically record architectural relics of the industrial age. Gurskys subject matter is late-capitalist society and the systems of exchange that organize it, and his practice is equally totalizing and taxonomic. His pictures may be described as modern-day versions of classical history painting in that they reproduce the collective mythologies that fuel contemporary culture: travel and leisure (sporting events, clubs, airports, hotel interiors, art galleries), finance (stock exchanges, sites of commerce), material production (factories, production lines), and information (libraries, book pages, data). Large in scale and brilliantly lit, Gurskys color photographs emulate the physicality of oil on canvas.Despite the traditions he invokes both formally and conceptually, Gursky has no pretense to objectivity. He digitally manipulates his imagescombining discrete views of the same subject, deleting extraneous details, enhancing colorsto create a kind of assisted realism. The traders on the floor of the Singapore stock exchange, in Gurskys version, all wear the same shade of red, yellow, or blue jacket. And his epic view of the Stockholm public library, a perfect hemisphere of color-coded books, omits the actual floor, which, in reality, includes an escalator that would have marred the symmetrical beauty of the image. According to art historian Norman Bryson, the critical paradox of Gurskys photography lies in its dual commitment to objectively observing the social strata at work in the world and to aestheticizing empirical reality, an impulse that almost sabotages the science of his project. In this dialectic, the artist provocatively undermines photographys claims for truth, offering, instead, as Bryson suggests, an inquiry into the subjective dimensions of all representations of the social.Nancy Spector\r\n        ",

The video is sourced from footage of British clubs that spans trends in fashion and attitude from the 1970s to the 1990s. Despite the differences among the partygoers, Leckeys film unites the disparate cultural moments in a frenzy of youthful, euphoric ritual. Tongue in cheek, the title alludes to Italian fashion house Fiorucci, wildly popular during the artists youth in the late 70s. Although dress and taste evolve through Leckeys edited juxtapositions, brand allegiance and material symbolism are undeniable constants in an otherwise fleeting remix of three decades of dance culture.\n",

The ten-hour event culminated at sunset, when its organizer, Aleksandra Mir (b. 1967, Lubin, Poland; Swedish citizen), ascended to the highest peak, planted an American flag in the sand, and proclaimed herself the first woman on the moon. Occuring on roughly the 30th anniversary of Neil Armstrong's famous first walk on the moon, Mir's low-budget, deliberately fake performance formed a wry feminist comment on the persistence of gender inequalitya sort of counterpart to Armstrong's one small step for man. First Woman on the Moon (1999) also explored how Armstrong's moonwalk has existed as a mediated reality for everyone except the astronauts themselves, which accounts for its having spawned countless conspiracy theories. The artist deliberately engaged the media for her self-immortalizing spectacle, advertising the event in Artforum and encouraging TV stations and local newspapers to cover it. Although the dunes were leveled that evening, the performance lives on in mediated memory, through a video documentary, numerous publicity stills, and such relics as the original flag.Ted Mann\n",

Her colorful large-scale paintings recall early 20th-century hard-edged geometric abstraction and evoke the history of the modernist grid. But far from an exercise in formalism, Morriss compositions reference the network of power relationships and communication systems encoded in the architecture of late capitalism.Executed in household gloss and saturated neon colors to achieve a slick industrial sheen that echoes their subjects, Morriss paintings isolate and abstract iconic architecture, reducing the facades of various structures to angled grids with colored cells that suggest the reflected glow of the urban environment. Mandalay Bay [Las Vegas] belongs to a series of paintings based on hotels and casinos on the Las Vegas strip. The artist was interested in the way in which Las Vegas hotels integrate giant electronic billboards that advertise no product but themselves, thereby echoing the hermetic and self-referential nature of much of abstract painting. In such works, Morris mimics the way in which architecture serves as a seductive sign for corporate powerin this case, that of the entertainment industry.Ted Mann\n",

His work stems from a long-standing interest in containerswhether buildings or shipping vesselsas symbols for our obsession with systematizing, categorizing, packaging, and regulating. Constructed out of the humblest of building materials, such as plywood and chipboard, his structures have a deliberately makeshift and provisional appearance. He frequently adds found materials, such as photographs or magazine clippings, to the surfacesinterruptions that further muddle the meaning of the works by making it unclear whether we are looking at interior or exterior, a volumetric structure or a support for something else. The uncertainty engendered by this oscillation between form and function is the conceptual crux of Pernice's practice; untamed and unfinished, his works are like open-ended propositions. Sekretar is emblematic of this ambiguity. The piece was first shown at the Villa Merkel in Esslingen, Germany, an exhibition space that was once the private home of a German industrialist. On the one hand, the work suggests domestic furniturespecifically, an oversize desk with a bookshelf, or secretary. At the same time, allusions to walls, windows, and structural supports imply an architectural structure. Pernice often develops his sculptures from tiny cardboard models and drawings, which provide clues to his thought process. In one of the drawings for Sekretar, the artist wrote \"the secretary lives here\" over what resembles a building elevation, hinting at the structure as a small dwelling or a proposal for some future residence.\n",

The landscape and residents of Asti, the artist's hometown in northern Italy, were the subject of his photographic series I Pensatori di buchi (The Thinkers of Holes, 2002). First, the artist and his father spent several months digging large holes on their property, initially softening the soil by burning it. Then Perrone photographed young men from town, either clothed or naked, sitting at the edges of the openings. Perrone's manipulation of the land recalls 1970s Earthworks, and the collision of human beings and nature connects his practice to Arte Povera; like those Italian artists, Perrone explores the interchange between art, life, and the natural world. For Come suggestionati da quello che dietro loro rimane fermo (As if Fascinated by what Remains Still in the Background, 1999), he photographed elderly residents of Asti holding large animal horns and antlers. The juxtaposition of aging flesh and hardened organic material is a compelling existential metaphor that also lends a mythical, almost talismanic quality to the images.Meghan Dailey\r\n        ",

Like the work of his colleague Thomas Struth, Ruff's series exhibits the influence of their instructors at the Kunstakademie Dusseldorf, Bernd and Hilla Becher, by depicting banal scenes with a cool detachment. For Ruff, however, this aloofness often extends to his working methods. The photographs in his Stars series (198992) were reprinted from scientific negatives bought by Ruff from an observatory, and his Newspaper Pictures (199091), were rephotographed from newspapers but without captions. Ruff also freely manipulates his photographs with digital techniques. In Houses (198791), he digitally excised details that obstructed his formal vision; his Posters (1996present) are politically propagandistic collages assembled digitally; and his recent Nudes (1999present) are manipulated pornographic images downloaded from the Internet.Perhaps Ruff's two series Portraits (1981present) and Other Portraits (199495) best convey his varied artistic motives. Traditionally, portrait photography attempts to reveal the psychology of the depicted subjects through the strategic use of lighting, color, and setting, or by focusing on particular physical details. Both of Ruff's portrait series undermine this revelatory goal, in very different ways. In Portraits, sitters are placed before a neutral background, facing the camera without expression, bathed in an even light. This method elicits comparisons to passport photos, the mood of which these works share, except that Ruff enlarges these images to upward of two meters in height. While sharing the scale of these pictures, the images in Other Portraits adopt an opposite representational strategy: the subjects' likenesses are clearly altered, their facial features combined employing the same technology used by law enforcement for creating composite image of suspects. While the monumental physical presence and objective rendering of the faces in Portraits overshadow the individual personalities of those portrayed, but in Other Portraits such techniques of exaggeration are altogether absent. In the later series, as in his oeuvre as a whole, Ruff posits photographic objectivity only to expose it as fiction.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn Anri Sala's films, personal stories are intertwined with larger political and social narratives. Many of the artist's works make reference to his family while referring to past and present conditions in Albania, where he grew up. For IntervistaFinding the Words (1998), Sala, with the help of a lipreader, re-created the lost audio portion of a filmed interview his mother had given in the late 1970s as a member of the Communist Youth Party in Albania. In Sala's film mother and son are seen viewing the original tape together. As his mother is confronted with the past and her words, she wonders with astonishment at how she could so earnestly spout party rhetoric. Although the film depicts a moment of nostalgic reassessment more than culpability or disavowal, it makes a powerful comment on the lines between fact and fiction, and the intermingling of family and country.Although many of Sala's works address personal historieshis own and those of otherstheir themes of trauma, loss, and recovery are universal. Using tropes of both documentary and fictional filmmaking, Nocturnes (1999) approaches these themes in an uneasy exploration of insomnia and personal isolation. The film offers a brief but telling glimpse into the lives and psyches of two men Sala met while studying art in Turcoing, France: Jacques, who collects and obsessively cares for thousands of fish, and Denis, who copes with disturbing memories of his service as a United Nations peacekeeper in Bosnia by playing violent video games.The film cuts between shots of Turcoing's streets at night and the two men as they describe their nighttime activities. With his face dimly lit by the artificial glow of purplish aquarium lights, Jacques speaks of his fish population as if it were a metaphor for the darker side of human society. When you introduce a new fish into a tank, he explains, you must do it gently and slowly, so the others won't kill the newcomer. As Denis describes his terrifying wartime experiences, we never see his face, only his hands. After killing people, You cant live normally, he says. At the controls of his Sony PlayStation, Denis immerses himself in a still violent but fictional activity that fills hour after sleepless hour. As the film progresses, Jacques's and Denis's stories, and thus their identities, become less distinct from one another. These young men, outsiders both, derive a sense of power and purpose by controlling artificial situations, but their lives remain touched by anxiety and loneliness.\n",

Inspired by the systemic aspects of Minimalist painting and sculpture, he has consistently explored several themes with rigorous seriality throughout his career.The white screen that reappears in his Theaters series (begun in 1978) is itself the result of shooting the projection of a feature film. Photographing drive-ins, golden-age cinema palaces, and modern movie houses, he uses an exposure determined by the length of the screening. As each frame of film flickers by, the shifting action and light both cancels and accumulates until the film, shown in its entirety, is recorded as a bright, blank screen, appearing empty of imagery while actually filled to overflowing. Sugimoto calls this time exposedthe collecting, in one still image, of moments passed.His Seascapes series (begun in 1999) are photographed with cartographic precision. Each image, titled for the body of water depicted, is comprised of sea and sky bisected by the horizon. Rather than taming the subject through repeated documentation, the series grows more awesome and sublime, and the images reveal that only the temporary atmosphericsthe thickness of fog or stillness of the waterdistinguish one sea from the next.In his Portraits (begun in 1999), commissioned by the Deutsche Guggenheim, Sugimoto rekindles the dialogue between painting and the medium of mechanical reproduction. Sugimoto isolated wax figures from staged vignettes in waxworks museums, posed them in three-quarter-length view, and illuminated them to create haunting Rembrandt-esque portraits of historical figures, such as Henry VIII, Napoleon Bonaparte, Fidel Castro, and Princess Diana. His painterly renditions, lush with detail, recall the various paintings from which the wax figures were originally drawn.

Inspired by the systemic aspects of Minimalist painting and sculpture, he has consistently explored several themes with rigorous seriality throughout his career.The white screen that reappears in his Theaters series (begun in 1978) is itself the result of shooting the projection of a feature film. Photographing drive-ins, golden-age cinema palaces, and modern movie houses, he uses an exposure determined by the length of the screening. As each frame of film flickers by, the shifting action and light both cancels and accumulates until the film, shown in its entirety, is recorded as a bright, blank screen, appearing empty of imagery while actually filled to overflowing. Sugimoto calls this time exposedthe collecting, in one still image, of moments passed.His Seascapes series (begun in 1999) are photographed with cartographic precision. Each image, titled for the body of water depicted, is comprised of sea and sky bisected by the horizon. Rather than taming the subject through repeated documentation, the series grows more awesome and sublime, and the images reveal that only the temporary atmosphericsthe thickness of fog or stillness of the waterdistinguish one sea from the next.In his Portraits (begun in 1999), commissioned by the Deutsche Guggenheim, Sugimoto rekindles the dialogue between painting and the medium of mechanical reproduction. Sugimoto isolated wax figures from staged vignettes in waxworks museums, posed them in three-quarter-length view, and illuminated them to create haunting Rembrandt-esque portraits of historical figures, such as Henry VIII, Napoleon Bonaparte, Fidel Castro, and Princess Diana. His painterly renditions, lush with detail, recall the various paintings from which the wax figures were originally drawn. Through layers of reproductionfrom subject to painting to wax statue to photographthese images most consciously convey the collapsing of time and the retelling of history.Based on the long-standing association of black-and-white photography with the recording of truth, Sugimoto's photo-documents playfully reveal the illusion of this assumption.

    "description": "\nDescription\nSince the mid-1990s Hellen Van Meene has produced intimate photographs of adolescent girls whom she finds on the street. Like her fellow dutch photographer, Rineke Dijkstra, Van Meene is interested in adolescence as a fleeting, transitional stage. But unlike Dijkstra's large, full-length portraits of frontally posed youths, Van Meene's images are small and square in format, her models usually shown at half- or three-quarter length and at close range. Rather than confronting the camera, the young women in these photographs turn to the side, avert their gaze, or close their eyes. As a result, they appear to be caught by the camera in private, unguarded moments of introspection. But these photographs are far from candid snapshots. Although Van Meene uses only natural lighting and works in ordinary domestic spaces or outdoors, she maintains control over every element in her images, from the color and texture of the girls' clothes and props, to their pose and gaze. Van Meene is not interested in creating portraits; her subjects are anonymousall of her works are untitledand their real-life personalities remain obscured. Instead, she treats them as \"objects you direct and guide\" in order to achieve a \"certain mood.\" Van Meene acknowledges a certain affinity between the production of her pictures and filmmaking. In their careful arrangement of color, light, and texture, her works also recall traditional Western paintings. In particular, 17th-century paintings from the artist's native Netherlands are echoed in the cool northern light that appears in the broody sky at play against a girl's transluscent, blue jacket, or in a softly lit domestic interior that recalls paintings of Johannes Vermeer.Van Meene never idealizes her young models. Although they are costumed and choreographed, their bodies are those of ordinary adolescent girls, honestly recorded with baby fat, pimples, and other imperfections.

    "description": "\nDescription\nTwins who have collaborated since the early 1990s, Jane and Louise Wilson use film to examine sites of authority and secrecy, which evoke highly charged associations. They are concerned as much with the psychological impact of architecture as with its physical aspects. To film Stasi City (1997), they gained access to the former East German secret police headquarters in Berlin. Gamma (1997) was made at Greenham Common, a decommissioned American military base in Berkshire, England, where nuclear weapons were stored. In these films, which are shown as large-scale projections, the camera pans across eerie, abandoned offices, equipment, bunkers, and even empty missile silos. Occasionally, the Wilsons themselves appear as trespassers in these previously forbidden territories. Each film is comprised of two, three, or four different projections and are shown on multiple screens that face each other in a darkened gallery, completely absorbing the viewer in their locations' unsettling sense of claustrophobic emptiness.In Star City (2000), the Wilsons venture into another chapter of the Cold War: the space race between the Soviet Union and the United States. Though referenced obliquely, this history is unmistakably present in the piece, which was filmed at a cosmonaut training facility outside of Moscow. We see space capsules, derelict launchpads, control rooms, and rows of neatly stacked space suits and helmets, all accompanied by a sound track of clanging machinery, roaring fans, and a constant ambient drone. Projected onto four screens, the scenes shift subtly in pace and orientation, from close-up to distant shots and from vertical to horizontal. (Such contrasts are typical in the Wilsons' formal repertoire.) The underlying narrative is a tale of utopian idealism, science, and Communism gone awry, yielding only unfulfilled expectations and a program that languishes in economic disarray.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAmar Kanwars trilogy of films focuses on the relationship between India and Pakistan, nations that were established through postcolonial independence and their separation from each other at the stroke of midnight on August 14, 1947 (Pakistan celebrates its independence on the earlier day, India on the later). The sectarian division that continues in the fraught relationship between them is detailed vividly in Kanwars A Season Outside (1997), which examines the 12-inch mythical line  marking the border between the two nations at the Punjabi village of Wagah. Ritualized displays of military bravado are performed daily at this site of standoff, and made more poignant by the onerous physical labor of transferring goods from Indian to Pakistani hands across the same divide. Kanwar recalls the history of this unstable relationship in To Remember (2003), a meditation on the religiously motivated massacres of 2002 in Gujarat, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi. The film juxtaposes this violence with the memorial to Gandhis life and his assassination by a militant Hindu nationalist at Birla House, Delhi, in 1948. Together, these two contemplative works reflect on human aggression, and on a hostility that, as Gandhi believed, segregation does nothing to resolve. \nThe strife suffered by ruptured communities is brought closer to home in A Night of Prophecy (2002), in which social and cultural differences threaten to tear the nation of India apart. Featuring a series of poems and songs recorded in eleven languages across the states of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Nagaland, and Kashmir, the work portrays a people caught in a struggle around caste, poverty, and disenfranchisement. In one of the poems, Under Dadar Bridge, written in the 1970s by Prakash Jadhav in the voice of the historically discriminated-against Dalit caste, a son recalls having asked his deceased mother whether he was born Hindu or Muslim, to which she had replied, You are an abandoned spark of the worlds lusty fires, alluding to inherited division. With a poetic rhythm that accentuates their sense of anger and grief, these laments and elegies form a chorus that appears to portend change. \nConcerns with the brutality of human action and with the dilemmas that can result from historic events and the machinations of cultural and sociopolitical systems are apparent too in other artworks by Kanwar such as The Lightning Testimonies (2007), which deals with the history of sexual violence in the South Asian subcontinent dating back to the period of the partition of India and Pakistan; The Sovereign Forest: The Scene of Crime (2012), which traces devastating industrial encroachment in the southeast-Indian state of Orissa; and The Torn First Pages (200408), which reflects on politics and resistance in Myanmar. Giving voice to suppressed communities, almost-forgotten histories, and current political and social issues, Kanwar infuses these stark realities with visual richness, inspiring philosophical and ethical reflection.\nJune Yap\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nHanne Darboven's installation Hommage a Picasso engulfs the viewer in 9,720 of the artist's signature sheets of paper with numeric writing, which document the last decade of the twentieth century. The artist developed her conceptual approach to the demarcation of time in numerals and words beginning in the mid-1960s. She realized that the digits designating dates on the Gregorian calendar could serve as a neutral, graphic equivalent for the basically nonvisual phenomenon of time, which could be altered through the application of an ever-evolving system of her own making.In the 1970s, Darboven started incorporating additional elements in her work, among them texts by various authors, photographs, and assorted objects that she found, purchased, or received as gifts. Such items enhanced her exploration of specific and varied aspects of time and history, including biography.  In the late 1970s, Darboven began to produce musical scores based on the calendar and her personal number systems. Thus, by the end of the 1970s, all of the elements that came to characterize the Hanne Darboven style had been established.In this installation, she combines her numeric record of the twentieth century's end with a framed lithograph of Pablo Picasso's 1955 painting Seated Figure in Turkish, a series of purchased and commissioned sculptures ranging from a bronze, Roman-style bust of Picasso to birch-twig donkeys made in Poland, and the newly-produced musical work for 120 voices, Opus 60. She began this work in the mid-1990s, a time when fin-de siecle rhetoric was prevalent in the cultural conversation. As an artist totally focused on time and deeply committed to the theme of the century, Darboven naturally turned her attention to what that moment meant for her personally, and on a more universal level what one could say about art in the 20th-century. The resulting work engages her signature record of time, and it investigates a common theme of the 1990s: the recognition of archetypal individuals seen to represent the last one hundred years. In the case of art, this figure was clearly Pablo Picasso.Taken together, the various components of the installation paint a multi-layered portrait of Picasso and Hanne Darboven, which interrogates the central issues of repetition, citation, and homage in art. Hommage a Picasso simultaneously acknowledges that Picasso was the last great painter of the 20th century and argues that the repetitiveness of his late workand its legacy in the decades following his deathrevealed the limitations of the medium and the traditional approach to art as expression that he still utilized. Darboven cleverly contrasts this analytical portrait of Picasso with a conceptual picture of her own approach. Like the Spanish master, she continuously repeats and reinterprets the defining elements of her signature style.  But she has transcended the constraints of monotonous visual citations through her music, which is at once clearly identifiable as Hanne Darboven's work and indicative of the limitless possibilities of her oeuvre as a whole to reinvent itself time and again. Thus, the very notion of originality stands at the core of Hommage a Picasso.Valerie Hillings\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAt first glance, the photograph Small Wars (rescue) (19992002), appears to capture a frantic moment during a tense battle: A helicopter has been grounded and seems to have crashed, since smoke is pouring from its hull. A man in a camouflage uniform kneels on the ground, rifle cocked, prepared to fire. Two other men, also soldiers, given that they are wearing helmets, stand in the background, either dealing with the wreckage or poised to join the impending fight. The photograph was not taken on the frontlines, however, but is rather one of a series of pictures of men reenacting battles from the Vietnam War in the forests of Virginiasomething they do as a hobby. An-My Le, who left Vietnam as a young girl with her family in 1975 to move to the United States, conceived the project as a way to explore the mediatization of the Vietnam War and the ways it is presented on film and television. Since most people learn about the war from its portrayal in movies such as Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket, which focused on the violence experienced by the troops, Le set out to investigate the extent to which the Vietnam War is embedded in the collective memory of the United States. The men who reenact the battles are playing a part scripted by history, yet the battles ultimately bear little resemblance to the actual events on which they are based. Numerous factors point to this subtle subterfuge: There is notably little blood or gore in any of the photographs; the battles have been completely sanitized. Also, the surrounding foliage is made up of pines and oak trees, which are typical of North American woods rather than the dense tropical forests of Vietnam. The disorienting effect of the photograph raises broader questions of the reliability of media images of war. Le uses a large-format camera similar to that employed by Civil War photographer Alexander Gardner, who famously staged some of the scenes he shot. Her choice of camera taps into the larger history of war photography and the ways in which images are manipulated to varying ends, often either to downplay or to highlight the impact of war and the consequences of armed combat.\nClaire Barliant\n",

Amplified annually with another valise, this dynamic record marks not only all the years she has lived but also those to come. 1961 charts the passage of a lifetime by invoking travel, adventure, romance, and escape, though at its core is the melancholic reality that as the artwork grows, the artist ages, inevitably approaching mortality. The secondhand suitcases vary in size, color, and design, with individual tags and distinctive deterioration accentuating difference. In this way, Leonard uses the lives of others to describe her own. Allowing the suitcases to stand empty, the artist posits her own life as a cipher for the events, individuals, and emotions lost to the inevitable passage of time.\r\n.\r\n        ",

Influenced by the deadpan aesthetic and serial working methods of early Conceptual art, Lockhart often groups multiple photographs of one subject together so that nearly imperceptible differences undermine photographys time-honored tendency to freeze or capture a subject. To produce NO-no Ikebana, arranged by Haruko Takeichi, December 1, 2002 (December 23) (2003), Lockhart studied a group of Japanese farmers who radically subvert the elite Japanese art of ikebana, a form of flower arrangement, by using vegetables and crops in place of more traditionally beautiful blossoms. As farmers, they also give special consideration to the compositions life cycle, which Lockhart traces as a photographic triptych over the course of one month. The images of the Brussels sprouts highlight the passage of time and the process of decay, allowing nature to create its own aesthetic gesture against the minimal background. Lockharts focus on this agricultural, working-class variant of a storied artistic legacy reflects her abiding interest in documenting and understanding the lives of everyday people.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nFor Anonymity (2004 ), Poklong Anading photographs people in the streets of different cities he visits, showing them holding circular mirrors in front of their faces; this work, Counter Acts (2004), is the first in the series. The photographic gesture of seizing a moment in timewherein the act of seeing and the nature of light dictate the visual resultis here both doubled and foiled. The gazes of artist and subjects as they attempt to regard one another are obscured, the sunlight that is directed toward the camera by the mirrors controverting both the act of observation and the act of photography. In this group shot, the obstruction of vision is multiplied, intensifying this effect. The image is grainy and overexposed, its detail is, ironically, apparent in its shadows and darker areas. The anticipated process of illumination and revelation never occurs, the result speaking instead to concealment and the absence of knowledge. Presenting this image on a lightbox, the artist magnifies further the instability of the photographic surface, as this format speeds up the degeneration of the image over time.\nCounter Acts is representative of a practice that ranges over photography, painting, video, sculpture, and installation. Anadings projects are characterized by a distinctive perspective on and measured intervention in social phenomena. Scouring public space for his materials, he utilizes the ordinary and banal, responding subtly but immediately to his environment. As in his interventions, Anadings engagement with the subjects of the Anonymity series is fleeting. In another notable work Light suffers if there is no place to fall from (2007) Anading set up a neon light in the shape of a mousetrap at Finale Art Gallery in Manila. As viewers at the opening of the exhibition gathered around the structure, taking it for the artwork, Anading, standing behind them, surreptitiously photographed his audience enthralled in the act of looking. In this work, as in Counter Acts, medium and subject are exchanged in a canny reversal, resulting in not just an image or a representation, but also in a conceptual act.\nJune Yap\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nNavin Rawanchaikuls Places of Rebirth (2009) was inspired by the Thai artists first visit to Pakistan, the birthplace of his ancestors, in November 2008. As part of the South Asian diaspora, the artists family moved to Thailand in pursuit of opportunity in the region, and in the aftermath of 1947s partition of South Asia which had forced millions to migrate out of political and religious exigency. By train, ship, and foot, his mother and great-grandfather traveled from Gujranwala (the Punjab region that is now Pakistan) and India to Chiang Mai in Thailand to arrive at the place of his familys rebirth. During this period, Chiang Mai was a city of many migrants, who came from India, China, and Burma (now Myanmar). The fluid nature of this migratory history is familiar in South and Southeast Asia and often results in the exchange and adaptation of cultures, giving its participants a trans-geographic identity. Consequent to his familys assimilation into the region, the artists family changed its name from Rawal to its present more Thai-sounding form; in a related artwork, he portrays his great-grandfather in a turban, and himself in kindergarten uniform, displaying his former Indian last name in Thai script. These two portraits are titled Kheak and Kheak Origin (both 2010). In Thai, kheak means foreigner, signifying the artists inquiry into a past that seems for him partially lost.\nIn Places of Rebirth, Rawanchaikul narrates his familys migration and his own cross-border and cross-cultural negotiations. Painted in the style of the Indian movie posters that fascinated the artist as a child, the works self-conscious populist aesthetic reflects an artistic practice that moves from billboard painting to sculpture and pulp comics. Produced in collaboration with former cinema billboard painters, this panoramic display blends multigenerational images of the artists family and friends with those of people he encountered in Pakistan, and historical images from the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan. As a portrait of a communitys passage through time and space, his navigation of regional geopolitics is represented through his imaginary journey as a Thai artist in a local taxi (onomatopoeically known as a tuk-tuk), that transports him, along with his Japanese wife and their daughter, across the famous Wagah border dividing India and Pakistan. The painting underscores the way in which the idea of nation is defined by historical narrative, while layering that narrative over the personal and the imaginary. The painting is peppered with upbeat and optimistic messages of brotherhood, friendship, and togetherness that stand in stark contrast to the nations present divide. This reimagining and blurring of identity reflect the artists desire for a communion based on a dismantling of borders between nations and individuals.\nJune Yap\n",

A circular space that viewers can both circumambulate and enter, Link is designed as a kind of sanctuary. Each of the four videos within the structure projects images of Mori lying inert in her transparent Plexiglas body capsule against iconic vistas of thirteen different sites that represent three periods of human time: antiquity (the Giza pyramids), the present (Tokyo's Shibuya), and the future (the advanced megacity of Shanghai). Mori presents the viewer with a sense of time that defies linearity, giving form to the Buddhist concept of transmigration, wherein life and death are in constant states of mutual generation. The culmination of an important series of Mori's performance and photographic works that center on the body capsule performances, Link illustrates the major themes that have occupied the artist since her emergence in the early 1990s: the idea of the cyborg, the reinvention of ancient systems of spiritual knowledge for contemporary consumption, and more recently, the creation of an architecture of contemplative space.\n",

Her work particularly recalls that of early-nineteenth-century German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich, who often portrayed a single figure against the ocean or a vista from a high cliff to suggest a force greater than mere humanity. In Noguchis work such associations are most fully articulated in her series A Prime (199899), which comprises sunrise views taken from Mount Fuji, a sacred symbol of Japanese national identity.

    "description": "\nDescription\nJeff Burton works across conventional photographic hierarchies that characterize fine-art photography as the mediums highest form, fashion or commercial photography as a lower form, and pornography as lower still. A rigorous attention to detail and composition merges with a sense of seduction in his images, which often include a part ofbut seldom the whole ofa naked body. A drama seems always ready to unfold or, more accurately, is already going onit is simply happening outside the frame of the photograph, beyond our sight. The viewer acts as voyeur, taking pleasure either in looking at the sensuous body on display or in contriving the narrative that might surround it. Pointedly, Burton never offers the sexual, or even pornographic, act in his photographs; that is not to say that such acts are not happening, but that the photographer and the viewer are on the sidelines of such doings.Burton began his career on the sets of erotic filmsfilms that reveal everything in a way that can seem crude or obscene, even if titillating. By turning his camera and attention to the periphery, he captures the actors' oiled bodies at rest, unstaged. In doing so, he creates photographs that are more mysterious, more ambiguousand therefore markedly more seductivethan the images recorded for the films themselves. Burton relies on dramatic lighting, highly saturated colors, and low or unusual viewpointsas in Untitled #124 (reclining nude man) (2000)when photographing these fragmented scenes and making them the catalysts for personal memory, desire, and fantasy.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMaurizio Cattelan is the contemporary art world's court jester. While his art-historical predecessor may be the Dadaist punster Marcel Duchamp, Cattelan is heir to a much broader traditionthat of the clown, a tragicomic figure with a particular resonance in the artist's native Italy, birthplace of commedia dell'arte and the films of Federico Fellini and Roberto Benigni. Playing the role of the loser with great relish, Cattelan continuously pretends to sabotage his own chances for success and recognition. Claiming to have no ideas, he once fled an exhibition venue by climbing out a window and lowering himself down a knotted sheet. In another instance, the artist sold his allotted space at the Venice Biennale to a perfume company, which placed an advertisement for its product in the gallery.The same kind of self-effacement has also characterized much of Cattelan's sculptural work. In La Rivoluzione Siamo Noi (We are the revolution), a miniature effigy of the artist hangs from a Marcel Breuerdesigned clothing rack, dressed in Joseph Beuys's canonical felt suit, which the late German artist had worn during his action Isolation Unit (1971). Here, as it was first presented at the Migros Museum, Zurich, in 2000, Cattelan's \"mini-me\" occupies a large, otherwise empty gallery and appears to cower sheepishly, seemingly embarrassed that he did not have more ideas for the exhibition. However playful, Cattelan's identification with Beuys underscores some of the more profound aspects of his art. Like Beuys, Cattelan uses his own image to bear meaning in his work, and his perpetual claim \"I am not really an artist,\" is simply an inversion of Beuys's declaration that \"every man is an artist.\" Beuys presented himself as a shaman, a figure capable of healing the ills of the world through ritual and incantation. Cattelan, on the other hand, is a trickster who stirs up trouble in an all-too-complacent world. But this dichotomy proves false. In alchemical lore, the trickster character is both a shaman and a prankster who can transform himself at will in order to work his magic.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMiles Coolidge's photographs of suburban and industrial landscapes are impassive portraits of contemporary alienation. His works, among them Industrial Buildings and Police Station, Kids-R-Us, McDonald's (both 1994) from his Safetyville series (199495), document banal spaces where the possibility of human existence has nearly been evacuated. At first glance the twenty color prints of Safetyville seem to depict views of an anonymous, suburban town in America. Upon closer inspection, however, the details become less plausible and the scenes less convincingly real. Safetyville is, in fact, only a model, a miniature town built at one-third scale in Sacramento, California, and designed to teach children about pedestrian safety. The flatness of Coolidge's images of the site further underscores the distorted logic of the child-sized buildings, which are mere facades like structures on a movie set. In part a commentary on rampant American consumerism, the images draw attention to the corporate logos adorning the buildings. Those brand names, such as McDonald's and Procter and Gamble, become markers of identification and comfort.In his more recent series, Mattawa (2000), addressing a housing development for migrant farm workers in Washington state, Coolidge pushes the social critique of Safetyville even further. Mattawa #9, one work from this series of fourteen photographs, depicts rows of shipping containers that have been converted into worker dwellings. The narrow form of the containers stand in stark contrast to the mountains and fields that lie beyond their cold, geometric confines. Ironically, the workers are dehumanized as they are forced to inhabit the containers in which the fruits of their labor are transported. In both Safetyville and Mattawa, signifiers of daily life and human use, such as weathered facades, tattered signs, and cracked pavement, are mingled with an uncanny sense of absence. Employing an unlikely pairing, Coolidge fuses social commentary with a flat, formalist aesthetic.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nLike many contemporary German photographers, Elger Esser studied under Bernd and Hilla Becher at the Kunstakademie Dusseldorf. Yet unlike others schooled by the Bechers such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Hofer, or Thomas Struth, Esser attends to the unmanipulated, ephemeral, even romantic landscapes of Europe. Simply put, he photographs beaches, wetlands, riverbeds, and valleys. Such places offer up a low, straight horizon that is likely to be one of the most striking details of the resulting image. His views are often comprised largely of air and water, light and its reflection. In Ameland Pier X, Netherlands (2000), for example, the horizon divides the sky from the sea, forming two halves that are almost mirror images of each other, similarly tinted by the pale, luminous tones of an overcast day.There is a sense of placelessness to these landscapes, despite Esser's lending of location details to the titles. Whether they portray the Seine in Paris, a beach at Beaduc, France, or a narrow strip of the Dutch shore, his photographs pay tribute to the universal lure of a seemingly infinite horizon and ultimate calm in the foreground. The picturesque quality of these views brings to mind everything from old-fashioned scenic-view postcards to nineteenth-century American Luminist paintings. But in the stillness of the landscapes and their muted, dreamlike colors linger evocations of the sublime, recalling the expressive effect of works by such great Romantic landscape painters as Caspar David Friedrich. The large scale of Esser's prints coupled with the expansive distances and often indistinct horizons he photographs works to envelop the viewer, offering an alluring tension between the landscape originally encountered by the artist and experienced by the viewer.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nCandida Hofer began taking color photographs of interiors of public buildings, such as offices, banks, and waiting rooms, in 1979 while studying at the Kunstakademie Dusseldorf. Over the ensuing years, she has perfected her strategies for eliciting psychological undertones from her architectural subjects. In her stately photographs Hofer adopts a stance somewhere between detachment and direct involvement. While she does not aim for pure objectivity, as evidenced by her often slightly oblique camera angles, she remains at a certain distance, subtly observing and recording what she sees.Although Hofer's pictures rarely include people, vestiges of human activity are often evoked or replaced by inanimate surrogates, like a line of empty chairs or a cluster of tables. She frequently photographs archival spaces where information is collected, dispersed, or displayed, such as museums and libraries. Her systematic portrayal of these locations creates another kind of archive. Seen together, Hofer's works address society's abiding need for classification and uniformity. In Deichmanske Bibliothek Oslo II (2000), a few figures inhabit the vast library, which is structured by a seemingly endless succession of books, a series of monumental columns, and the receding grid of the ceiling. The rigid geometry of the scene is not imposed through any kind of digital manipulation. Hofer's defining compositional choice is her point of view (in this case, as if floating from above), surveying the orderly arrangement of systems of knowledge. In reality one moves quickly through these ordinary rooms, unaware of their extraordinary geometry, but in her photographs it is given sustained attention.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nUsing time, memory, and the texture of everyday experience as his mediums, Pierre Huyghe conflates the traditional dichotomy between art and life. Working in an array of cultural formatsfrom billboards and television broadcasts to community celebrations and museum exhibitionshe reformulates their codes and deploys them as catalysts for creating new experiential possibilities. A mode of perception that lies in the interstices between reality and its representation is the subject of his two-channel video, The Third Memory (2000), which reenacts the 1972 hold-up of a Brooklyn bank immortalized in Sidney Lumet's acclaimed film Dog Day Afternoon (1975). Almost 30 years later, Huyghe provides a platform for the heist's charismatic mastermind, John Wojtowicz, to relate his version of that infamous day in a reconstructed set of the bank. However, rather than clarify the personal history that Hollywood wrested from him, Wojtowicz appears to have been heavily influenced by the film, a testament to the inextricable merging of real events, the distortions of memory, and the mediating power of popular culture.The tension between fact and fiction is also at play in One Million Kingdoms, a work conceived as part of the collaborative project No Ghost Just a Shell, in which a manga character named Annlee is inserted into multiple artistic contexts. In Huyghe's animation, this adolescent girl wanders through a shifting lunar topography and, speaking in a digitally synthesized form of astronaut Neil Armstrong's voice, delivers a narration blending the actual transmissions from the Apollo 11 mission with excerpts from Jules Verne's 1864 novel Journey to the Center of the Earth. Annlee appears as a translucent outline, an empty cipher for creative interpretation. Yet at the same time, she is literally the author of her own environment: the mutating features of the landscape through which she walks are generated by the inflections of her own voice. Huyghe's own experience provides the starting point for This is not a time for dreaming. The film documents a puppet show that tells the parallel stories of the modernist architect Le Corbusier's commission to design the Carpenter Center for Visual Arts at Harvard University, and Huyghe's own commission to create an artwork to celebrate the building's 40th anniversary. Shifting back and forth in time, the narrative weaves together historical and contemporary events with fantastical elements, in an allegorical representation of the struggles and compromises inherent in the creative process. Co-production: Centre Georges Pompidou, Musee national d'art moderne, Service Nouveaux Medias and the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago. With the participation of: Marian Goodman Gallery, New York/Paris; Myriam and Jacques Salomon; Le Fresnoy, Studio national des arts contemporainsThis installation contains footage from the motion picture Dog Day Afternoon (Warner Brothers, 1975), directed by Sidney Lumet, and from The Jeanne Parr Show (CBS, January 25, 1978).\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAmar Kanwars trilogy of films focuses on the relationship between India and Pakistan, nations that were established through postcolonial independence and their separation from each other at the stroke of midnight on August 14, 1947 (Pakistan celebrates its independence on the earlier day, India on the later). The sectarian division that continues in the fraught relationship between them is detailed vividly in Kanwars A Season Outside (1997), which examines the 12-inch mythical line  marking the border between the two nations at the Punjabi village of Wagah. Ritualized displays of military bravado are performed daily at this site of standoff, and made more poignant by the onerous physical labor of transferring goods from Indian to Pakistani hands across the same divide. Kanwar recalls the history of this unstable relationship in To Remember (2003), a meditation on the religiously motivated massacres of 2002 in Gujarat, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi. The film juxtaposes this violence with the memorial to Gandhis life and his assassination by a militant Hindu nationalist at Birla House, Delhi, in 1948. Together, these two contemplative works reflect on human aggression, and on a hostility that, as Gandhi believed, segregation does nothing to resolve. \nThe strife suffered by ruptured communities is brought closer to home in A Night of Prophecy (2002), in which social and cultural differences threaten to tear the nation of India apart. Featuring a series of poems and songs recorded in eleven languages across the states of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Nagaland, and Kashmir, the work portrays a people caught in a struggle around caste, poverty, and disenfranchisement. In one of the poems, Under Dadar Bridge, written in the 1970s by Prakash Jadhav in the voice of the historically discriminated-against Dalit caste, a son recalls having asked his deceased mother whether he was born Hindu or Muslim, to which she had replied, You are an abandoned spark of the worlds lusty fires, alluding to inherited division. With a poetic rhythm that accentuates their sense of anger and grief, these laments and elegies form a chorus that appears to portend change. \nConcerns with the brutality of human action and with the dilemmas that can result from historic events and the machinations of cultural and sociopolitical systems are apparent too in other artworks by Kanwar such as The Lightning Testimonies (2007), which deals with the history of sexual violence in the South Asian subcontinent dating back to the period of the partition of India and Pakistan; The Sovereign Forest: The Scene of Crime (2012), which traces devastating industrial encroachment in the southeast-Indian state of Orissa; and The Torn First Pages (200408), which reflects on politics and resistance in Myanmar. Giving voice to suppressed communities, almost-forgotten histories, and current political and social issues, Kanwar infuses these stark realities with visual richness, inspiring philosophical and ethical reflection.\nJune Yap\n",

With his stated artistic intention to communicate with the masses, Koons draws from the visual language of advertising, marketing, and the entertainment industry. Testing the limits between popular and elite culture, his sculptural menagerie includes Plexiglas-encased Hoover vacuum cleaners, basketballs suspended in glass aquariums, photo-based paintings of himself copulating with his then-wife Ilona Staller (also known as La Cicciolina, former adult-film star and member of Italian parliament), and porcelain homages to Michael Jackson and the Pink Panther. Extending the lineage of Dada and integrating traces of Minimalism and Pop, Koons stages art as a commodity that cannot be placed in a conventional aesthetic hierarchy.For the series  (200002), Koons culled imagery from a wide spectrum of popular culture, focusing especially on advertising for fashion, cosmetics, and food. Eyelids decked in glitter and mascara, rivers of molten caramel, windswept locks of hair, and twisting roller coasters are all set against sublime landscapes. These familiar but unrelated images come together like a collage, yet each is repainted with photorealist perfection, creating a unified optical field rife with sticky-sweet, carnal pleasures. In Niagara, a waterfall of women's legs echoes the eponymous landscape. The abundantly glazed pastries and triple scoop of ice cream further signal the artist's ongoing interest in mass imagery, consumerism, and desire.This work, along with others in Easyfun-Ethereal, is part of Koons's new brand of Pop painting, recalling in particular the advertising iconography and billboard-style painting technique present in James Rosenquist's canvases. In Sandwiches the artist refers to this predecessor by including the glistening chrome of a 1963 Chevy Impala at the upper right corner. At the same time, the collage of animated deli meats, the turkey made of ice cream, and the cartoon eye and moustache recall the free-associative imagery of Salvador Dali, Max Ernst, and Rene Magritte, while the background streams and splashes of milk echo Jackson Pollock's abstractions. Koons's fusion of Pop representations with Surrealist and abstract overtones creates a hybrid of fun and fantasy, yielding a body of work that depicts gravity-defying forms of dreamlike pleasure.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nTo create his art, Richard Long walks hundreds of miles for days, even weeks at a time, through uncultivated areas of land: the countryside of England, Ireland, and Scotland; the mountains of Nepal and Japan; the plains of Africa, Mexico, and Bolivia. He documents these journeys with captioned large-scale photographs, maps, and lists of descriptive terms, which are exhibited as individual works. While traveling, Long sets specific tasks for himself, such as traversing an absolutely straight line for a predetermined distance, following the side of a river wherever it may lead, or picking up and then dropping stones at certain intervals along the way. While on these trips, the artist interacts with the landscape by creating modest sculptures from indigenous materials, thus attesting to his presence in the land. Circles or linesLong's signature motifsrubbed into the ground by repeated footprints or composed of assembled stones, driftwood, or seaweed are eventually dissolved by the wind, rain, and rising tides, thus negating human dominance over nature. His photographs remain the only evidence of these organic sculptures after erosion has run its course.Long translates his deeply personal experiences in the wilderness into sculptures and mud drawings that are created for exhibition spaces and private collections. Pieces composed of flint, slate, feathers, pine needles, sticks, and other rustic materials become metaphors for the paths taken on his ramblings: the spirals, circles, and lines, if extended beyond the gallery walls, would trace actual distances traveled by the artist. The sculptures are not, therefore, representations of nature per se but rather aesthetic documents of Long's engagement with the land and poetic evocations of the beauty and grandeur of the earth.Such is the case with Red Slate Circle (1980), which consists of 474 stones from a New York State quarry. When it is installed in the Guggenheim's rotunda, the monumental ring echoes the building's unique spiral while conjuring images of vast canyons, still lakes, and stone pathways leading into the distance. Bilbao Circle (2000), originally created for the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, uses slate stones quarried in historic Delabole, a village in Cornwall that boasts the oldest working slate quarry in England. Walking around the sculptures viewers reenact in part the artist's own perambulations. When viewed from above, the works are reminiscent of the mysterious large-scale crop-circles or prehistoric rock formations, such as Stonehenge, that hint at interventions from some other world. The artist has even created pieces related to specific ancient sites in England, including the Cerne Abbas Giant, the Long Man, and Silbury Hill. All Long's works evoke a time characterized by a more spiritual interaction between man and landscape.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nInigo Manglano-Ovalle has created a diverse body of work that comprises installation-based practices, photography, sculpture, and community-based projects. Filtering his subject matter through the lens of modernity, he explores a broad range of issuessuch as representation and identity, new technologies, and structures of powerand simultaneously reexamines modernist theories and strategies. Manglano-Ovalle mines the often detached, cool logic of modernism and abstract formalism in order to reach a more expansive and inclusive treatment of social and individual realities. Seemingly neutral and clinical realms of science, such as climatology and genomic mapping, are problematized and engaged as form and content in his work. The assumptions of those fields and their implications in creating or reifying social hierarchies slowly and subtly emerge in the artist's ambitious projects.The video installation Climate (2000) has a tripartite structurein both narrative and formand reflects Manglano-Ovalle's interest in exploring simultaneity. The piece also demonstrates his insistence on drawing viewers in to engage directly, and thus be implicated in, the space of the installation rather than simply interacting as contemplative onlookers. The three separate videos in Climate were filmed in Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's sleekly modernist Lake Shore Drive Apartments (194951) in Chicago, and examine the assumptions of International Style architecture within the framework of today's increasingly globalized society. In this work, surveillance technology, assault weapons, and people waiting suggest a chilling world without boundaries in which nature has been dominated by a sterile, detached precision.The DNA portraits by Manglano-Ovalle engage the formalist arguments of modernist art critic Clement Greenberg and the aesthetics of the Post-painterly abstraction he championed. Manglano-Ovalle's seemingly abstract color print Glenn, Dario, and Tyrone (from The Garden of Delights [1998]), is in fact a photograph of three individuals' DNA samples. For the series, the artist asked sixteen individuals to take part, each selecting two others with whom he or she would like to be represented in a triptych portrait. With this introduction of self-determination, Manglano-Ovalle allowed his participants to create and define their own network of relationships and make choices about the representation of family.Manglano-Ovalle's engagement with issues of typology, genealogy, and racial makeup extend beyond the recent issues that DNA technologies have raised, taking in part his inspiration from Hieronymus Bosch's painting The Garden of Earthly Delights (150510), and the fantastic grotesqueries that emerged from Bosch's imaginary mixed couplings. Manglano-Ovalle was also interested in these issues as they are represented in Spanish colonial casta (caste) paintings. A taxonomy of the racial mixing of Spaniards, Indians, and Africans, the casta paintings were meant to impose a hierarchy of race and class in a rapidly hybridizing New World. Manglano-Ovalle problematizes issues of representation, objectification, and social control in his contemporary portraits.\n",

The London-based artist uses her own children as subjects for her work, digitally manipulating their actions to create psychologically harrowing scenarios. One notable piece from 1998 shows her two-year-old son taking a drag from a cigarette, an uneasy illusion created by the combination of footage of the child playing with a toy cigarette and images of adults smoking along with other computerized effects. In President Bill Clinton, Memphis, Tennessee, November 13, 1993 (2000), we listen to one of her boys read a speech given by the former president on that date espousing the disciplined loving parental structure and its positive impact on society. His too-young voice highlights the artificiality of the words while the video shows both boys unwrapping gloriously red-wrapped Christmas packages on a continuous, speeded-up loop. In this, like Marshall's other videos, the tension between innocence and encroaching adult reality is rendered with an anxious emotional clarity.Meghan Dailey\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nRyan McGinley gravitated toward street culture early in his adolescence and began hanging out with a band of self-proclaimed outsidersskateboarders, club kids, graffiti artists, queer-identified youths, and indie musiciansin New Jersey and downtown Manhattan. What began as candid images of his and his friends lifestyles are now seen as iconic documents of a generation. McGinleys early photographs show androgynous, often-nude youths raving, hanging precariously from rooftops, shoplifting, running, falling, cavorting, and living with hedonistic abandon, exuberance, and rebellion. While initially capturing youth culture in an urban context, in 2003 McGinley began to place his subjects in the natural world, constructing loose situations that would inspire spontaneous actions. Throughout, McGinleys friends have been willing collaborators, keenly aware of the camera while displaying a transcendent candor, as they help to create enticing visions of a new bohemian coterie. In a later series of 200406, McGinley photographed fans of the musician Morrissey whom he did not know personally, though he had intimate knowledge of their milieu, having also been a fan himself. Here, while following Morrisseys tours for two years, he portrays the enraptured experience of individuals lost in their devotion to an idol.\n",

She frequently works with perishable organic materials, such as culinary spices, dried fruits and flowers, and desiccated insects, and has on occasion incorporated decay and deterioration directly into her art. (For one series, she released hungry snails onto sheets of rice paper; the finished pages chronicle the creatures' paths of munching and excreting.) More often, disintegration is merely implied in fragile, temporary installationsgarlic peels suspended from vegetal fibers, white marble dust placed in the cracks between floor tiles, and clipped insect wings floating in bowls of olive oil and water. Neuenschwander has frequently turned to photography and film to capture and preserve the fugitive. For Belong. Not belong. (2001), she photographed various arrangements of beetles partially encased in soap bubbles. The soap bubble also appears in Inventory of small deaths (blow) (2000), a film Neuenschwander produced with Cao Guimaraes that tracks the slow progress of a large, single bubble, as it drifts across a tropical landscape. Set on a loop, the film shows the bubble billowing in the wind, shifting shape, but never popping. The climax of the bubble's death is eternally postponed, so that something fleeting is granted permanence.Ted Mann\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nJohn Pilson's video and photography work explores corporate space, linking the ordered logic of the grid and line of modernism and Minimalism to the rigid grids and lines of the cityscape and the office. In his sparsely populated scenes, anonymous work spaces appear largely devoid of employees to animate them, which underscores the cold, impersonal nature of the corporate environment. What is ubiquitous is the cubicle; with its false walls and false nods toward privacy and permanence, the disposable architecture seemingly conveys a not-so-subtle message to its potentially disposable occupants. Like filmmakers Charlie Chaplin and Jacques Tati, Pilson conveys an absurdist sense of modern working life, but updates his predecessors' themes with a contemporary sense of alienation from ones white-collar labor. In the multi-channel video installation A la claire fontaine (2000), a young girl achieves fleeting moments of self-expression against the backdrop of a cold, empty, and distant modernist landscape. Pressed up against the glass of a high-rise office, she exhales onto the window and then draws with her finger into the fog, singing to herself A la claire fontaine, a French song about loss and longing. On a different channel we see this girl perched in a potted tree, looking down onto the cityscape from the height of the towering office building. However, the notion of scale is rendered as absurd as the attempt to naturalize such spaces with the introduction of living plants, uprooted from their natural context.In yet another channel a frustrated desire for real relationships and rapports turns into an aggressive yet illogical confrontation, as a worker in an office mailroom is pelted with rubber balls. On another monitor we watch blurred legs running rapidly back and forth against a bare office wall. The urgent repetition suggests a yearning for purpose, as meaningful action in these workplace settings seems elusive.Equally, the workplace's standard indicators fail to convey real meaning. In another scene from A la claire fontaine an electronic stock index runs a seemingly indecipherable code of signs and numbers over a densely jumbled yet empty trading floor. Another shot is fixed on two phones on a credenza; we wait expectantly for them to ring, but they never do. Frustrated expectations for communication abound; the tools are there, but the meanings and messages are lacking. In Pilsons corporate scenes, the work environments are at once spare, slick, and unkempt. Although files, boxes, and storage systems abound, there seems to be little of substance to fill them. Ironically, the spaces in which workers find themselves spending greater and greater percentages of their lives retain nary a trace of their inhabitants.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nShortly before entering art school, Elizabeth Charlotte Rist took the name Pipilotti, combining her childhood nickname, Lotti, with Pippi Longstocking, the heroine of the Swedish children's book series. Rist's identification with the girl-adventurera playful yet fiercely independent orphan who possesses magical strengthpoints to several features of her work: her ready borrowing from popular culture, whimsical exploration of the fantastic, and unconventional approach to female subjectivity.Since emerging in the mid-1980s, Rist has drawn as much from the language of the mass media as she has from first-generation video artists like Nam June Paik. In particular, the saturated colors, hallucinatory effects, and prominent sound tracks of her works have elicited comparisons to the language of music videos. While exploiting the sensuous qualities of the medium, however, Rist eschews popular conventions of narrative and spectatorship, especially in the way that she presents female subjects. Sip My Ocean, a video projected as two mirrored reflections on adjoining walls, offers a kaleidoscopic view of an idyllic underwater paradise, with a flowing sequence of dreamlike images, including intermittent close-ups of a bikini-clad woman floating and swimming through the waves along with views of various domestic objects sinking to the seabed. The implicit voyeurism and exaggerated hyperfeminity of such images are complicated by the accompanying sound track, in which the artist's rendition of Chris Isaac's melancholy pop song Wicked Game is punctuated by her repeated shrieking of the lyrics I don't want to fall in love. Although she denies having an explicitly feminist agenda, Rist frequently merges eroticism and coquettishness with aggression and hysteria to produce provocative fantasies of female empowerment.Rist's video installations since the mid-1990s have varied radically in scale and context, from a thumb-size monitor embedded in the floor to a billboard-size projection in New York's Times Square. Himalaya's Sister's Living Room is one of several room-size environments in which she has explored domestic space. The work beckons the viewer into a dimly lit interior cluttered with furniture and objects from different eras, some of which are uncannily animated by videos cast from hidden projectors: on a side table, the artist presses her face against a windowpane; a liquor bottle atop a 1950s-era bar glows with a soccer game. Rist has noted that the moving picture itself is always a room within another room. Just as she employs video to explore the interiority of her female characters, here she uses projections to penetrate inanimate objects, uncovering the thoughts and memories embedded within the collective space of the household.\n",

He digitally manipulates found photographs, often snapshots and amateurish landscapes, by changing the scale, eliminating details, blurring focus, and adding color. His process is akin to painting in that he extrapolates his own images from reality instead of relying solely on the cameras record. With the most popular and private sort of photographs, he strives to discern an objective form embedded in each, something glimpsed by the camera and not the individual. Sasse's titles, which are numbers selected randomly by a computer, reinforce this sense of a mechanical consciousness in his work.Sasse studied at the Kunstakademie Dusseldorf with Bernd and Hilla Becher, and his inclusion of industrial structures in his work recalls their interest in juxtaposing such forms. Departing from the Bechers, however, Sasse neither repeatedly analyzes one structure nor records any verifiable reality. In 2637 (2000), parallel planks of scaffolding, which appear to recede naturally in one-point perspective, seem on closer inspection to physically intersect, creating the sense of an impossibly claustrophobic space. This shallow vanishing point disallows entry into the pictorial space, an index of the flatness of the photograph itself. In other works, the artist references the tension between surface and depth, as well as fiction and reality, by slightly blurring the image, making it impossible to discern whether it is coming into or out of focus. This recalls the work of Gerhard Richter, whose paintings employ the vocabulary of photography, and for whom the blur is a reminder of his image's artifice. In Sasse's work, such devices are more difficult to read. The rapidly spinning carnival ride glimpsed over the edge of a wall in 8246 (2000) was static when photographed. Thus its current state is doubly an image of longing: we are barred from the ride's excitement by the bleak industrial building in the foreground and the fact that this intimation of splendor did not exist for the camera.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWolfgang Tillmans's photographs of friends, dance raves, clubs, and night life have appeared regularly in London's i-D magazine and other publications since 1989. Though his work has had a tremendous impact on the studied casualness of much recent fashion photography, Tillmans is not a \"fashion photographer.\" If anything he is a portraitist who often photographs his friendswho appear alternately tough, vulnerable, loving, ferocious, gay, and straightin intimate situations. Though these probing images reflect his own subjective experiences, they also operate on a more general level, recording a specific dimension of our contemporary culture. Tillmans establishes a collaborative process with his models, whom he calls \"accomplices.\" Thus the informal look of the works belies their choreographed construction. Landscape and still-life images also play a crucial role in his oeuvre, in which half-eaten fruit, sewer rats, crumpled clothing, or urban skylines are photographed with the same dignity and attention to beauty as his human subjects. Traditional subject genres are questioned; crumpled clothing might suggest a figure or landscape, while city scenes seen from the air resemble a still life of objects.For Tillmans, the images are only half the work; the installation or layout constitutes its completion. He affixes his prints directly to the wall with pins or tape, juxtaposing old and new images of varying sizes and mediums. He eschews standard darkroom procedures, blurring the lines between color and black and white (printing black-and-white images on color paper, for instance). Color photographs are placed next to inkjet prints and next to postcards and magazine clippings of his own images, contesting conventional hierarchies of scale and subject matter while drawing focus to the materiality of the photographic medium all within a carefully composed environment that seems to disdain permanency.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nKara Walker provocatively engages American slavery in nearly life-size silhouettes that hijack racial stereotypes and exaggerated physiognomies drawn from blackface entertainment. Amid nightmarish revivals of the antebellum South, hyperactive shadow forms expose and reverse a fundamental operation of minstrelsy: the projection of white audiences' illicit desires and irrational fears onto black bodies. Pushing derogatory caricatures to absurd limits, Walker overturns the diffusion of violence through comedy. Jokes are rerouted, punch lines go astray, and heroes and villains switch places. Walker herself inhabits these scenes as the Negress. Mischievously subverting any straight story, these theaters of horror thrive on the proximity between attraction and revulsion, drawing together love and hate, violence and tenderness, for a more complex approach to an unsettled historical problem.Throughout Walker's work, field slaves, house slaves, white patriarchs, and Southern belles stud a multigenerational cast that cavorts in polyamorous unions tinged with sadomasochism, surrounded by plantation effluvia. Details are merely hinted by the outline of silhouettes, objects of antiquated craft used in portraiture, and the depiction of mundane domestic scenes. These genteel ciphers depend on the viewer's intimacy with the subject matter to fill the voids. In Walker's hands, static vignettes become hyperactive cinematic panoramas. The vagueness of the silhouette consistently undermines the process of identifying the images, teasing and exploiting visual stereotypes. A knowing smirk lingers on the face of the Negress in the suggestive blankness of cut paper, disrupting propriety and disturbing sensibilities in order to activate critical thought and social conscience.In Insurrection! (Our Tools Were Rudimentary, Yet We Pressed On), Walker applied colored projections to her silhouette tableaux for the first time. The additional layer disallows passive voyeurism. As viewers step into the environment, their shadows join the sinister scene. Here a woman flees with a noose still hanging from her neck; there in the Big House, another woman's rag-wrapped head tilts over a body that she disembowels with a ladle; outside, another young girl straddles a gentleman whose head she lifts off effortlessly. Walker dissects conditions of desperation, subjugation, and the decadence of power, staging fantastical confrontations with the illogic of human bondage.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nLawrence Weiner is a sculptor whose medium is language. His texts describe material processes and physical conditions; they delineate space and indicate location. Since 1968, when he concluded that the actual construction of a work was not critical to its existence in the world, Weiner has authored hundreds of linguistic artworks. Prior to this time, his material sculptures had been prefaced by titles that dictated the means of their fabrication. When the outdoor installation A SERIES OF STAKES SET IN THE GROUND AT REGULAR INTERVALS TO FORM A RECTANGLETWINE STRUNG FROM STAKE TO STAKE TO DEMARK A GRIDA RECTANGLE REMOVED FROM THIS RECTANGLE (1968) was damaged, Weiner realized that the essence of a work is textual and not physical. This led him to the following formulation, first published in 1968, which continues to outline his conceptual approach to artmaking: (1) The artist may construct the piece. (2) The piece may be fabricated. (3) The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of artist, the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership.1In a radical restructuring of the traditional artist/viewer relationship, Weiner shifted the responsibility of the work's realization to its audience, while also redefining standard systems of artistic distribution. A work such as A STAKE SET (1969) can be made or merely spelled out on a museum wall, but it can also be read in a book or heard if uttered aloud. Weiner's art can literally be disseminated by word of mouth. Much of the early work rehearses simple actions involving basic substancespouring paint, digging trenches, removing plasterand, like all subsequent examples, are stated in the past tense to avoid the authoritative tone of a command. Others are more spectacular, involving firecrackers and dynamite. THE RESIDUE OF A FLARE IGNITED UPON A BOUNDARY (1969), a piece that Weiner actually executed in Amsterdam for the Stedelijk Museum's pivotal 1969 Conceptual art exhibition Op Losse Schroeven: Situaties en Cryptostructuren (Square Pegs in Round Holes: Structures and Cryptostructures), is poetic in its ability to evoke vivid imagery, while at the time suggesting coded systems of communication. Weiner gradually extended his engagement with language to ready-made structures, such as idioms, cliches, and proverbs, which underscore the contingent nature of meaning when encountered in different contexts. The Christian burial recitation \"Earth to Earth, Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust\" becomes, in nonliturgical circumstances, a simple meditation on materials and processes of transmutation (EARTH TO EARTH ASHES TO ASHES DUST TO DUST [1970]).Nancy Spector1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nHanne Darboven's installation Hommage a Picasso engulfs the viewer in 9,720 of the artist's signature sheets of paper with numeric writing, which document the last decade of the twentieth century. The artist developed her conceptual approach to the demarcation of time in numerals and words beginning in the mid-1960s. She realized that the digits designating dates on the Gregorian calendar could serve as a neutral, graphic equivalent for the basically nonvisual phenomenon of time, which could be altered through the application of an ever-evolving system of her own making.In the 1970s, Darboven started incorporating additional elements in her work, among them texts by various authors, photographs, and assorted objects that she found, purchased, or received as gifts. Such items enhanced her exploration of specific and varied aspects of time and history, including biography.  In the late 1970s, Darboven began to produce musical scores based on the calendar and her personal number systems. Thus, by the end of the 1970s, all of the elements that came to characterize the Hanne Darboven style had been established.In this installation, she combines her numeric record of the twentieth century's end with a framed lithograph of Pablo Picasso's 1955 painting Seated Figure in Turkish, a series of purchased and commissioned sculptures ranging from a bronze, Roman-style bust of Picasso to birch-twig donkeys made in Poland, and the newly-produced musical work for 120 voices, Opus 60. She began this work in the mid-1990s, a time when fin-de siecle rhetoric was prevalent in the cultural conversation. As an artist totally focused on time and deeply committed to the theme of the century, Darboven naturally turned her attention to what that moment meant for her personally, and on a more universal level what one could say about art in the 20th-century. The resulting work engages her signature record of time, and it investigates a common theme of the 1990s: the recognition of archetypal individuals seen to represent the last one hundred years. In the case of art, this figure was clearly Pablo Picasso.Taken together, the various components of the installation paint a multi-layered portrait of Picasso and Hanne Darboven, which interrogates the central issues of repetition, citation, and homage in art. Hommage a Picasso simultaneously acknowledges that Picasso was the last great painter of the 20th century and argues that the repetitiveness of his late workand its legacy in the decades following his deathrevealed the limitations of the medium and the traditional approach to art as expression that he still utilized. Darboven cleverly contrasts this analytical portrait of Picasso with a conceptual picture of her own approach. Like the Spanish master, she continuously repeats and reinterprets the defining elements of her signature style.  But she has transcended the constraints of monotonous visual citations through her music, which is at once clearly identifiable as Hanne Darboven's work and indicative of the limitless possibilities of her oeuvre as a whole to reinvent itself time and again. Thus, the very notion of originality stands at the core of Hommage a Picasso.Valerie Hillings\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAt first glance, the photograph Small Wars (rescue) (19992002), appears to capture a frantic moment during a tense battle: A helicopter has been grounded and seems to have crashed, since smoke is pouring from its hull. A man in a camouflage uniform kneels on the ground, rifle cocked, prepared to fire. Two other men, also soldiers, given that they are wearing helmets, stand in the background, either dealing with the wreckage or poised to join the impending fight. The photograph was not taken on the frontlines, however, but is rather one of a series of pictures of men reenacting battles from the Vietnam War in the forests of Virginiasomething they do as a hobby. An-My Le, who left Vietnam as a young girl with her family in 1975 to move to the United States, conceived the project as a way to explore the mediatization of the Vietnam War and the ways it is presented on film and television. Since most people learn about the war from its portrayal in movies such as Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket, which focused on the violence experienced by the troops, Le set out to investigate the extent to which the Vietnam War is embedded in the collective memory of the United States. The men who reenact the battles are playing a part scripted by history, yet the battles ultimately bear little resemblance to the actual events on which they are based. Numerous factors point to this subtle subterfuge: There is notably little blood or gore in any of the photographs; the battles have been completely sanitized. Also, the surrounding foliage is made up of pines and oak trees, which are typical of North American woods rather than the dense tropical forests of Vietnam. The disorienting effect of the photograph raises broader questions of the reliability of media images of war. Le uses a large-format camera similar to that employed by Civil War photographer Alexander Gardner, who famously staged some of the scenes he shot. Her choice of camera taps into the larger history of war photography and the ways in which images are manipulated to varying ends, often either to downplay or to highlight the impact of war and the consequences of armed combat.\nClaire Barliant\n",

Afisinas early experimental work What . . . (2001) marks a significant moment of convergence between Indonesian performance art and video, and a turning point in the practice of the artist, whose background is in cinematography. The video, which was shot during the Islamic holiday Eid, held in in the fasting months of Ramadhan, records a performance by the artist carried out while alone in ruangrupas space. Contemplating the occasions purpose as a time for spiritual reflection, he turned to certain biblical verses, specifically Luke 12:311.

While Indonesias administration is secular, it is a predominantly Muslim country; Afisinas work presents a moderate and inclusive view of its context, one in which the values of different religions converge. As a source of religious guidance, this biblical text shares with the Koran the aim of teaching readers how to comport themselves, understand, and believe. Emphasizing the verses counsel and admonishment, the artist slaps himself repeatedly, an act of violence that becomes increasingly uncomfortable for the viewer. In so doing, he raises the subjects of justice, retribution, suffering, empathy, and compassion. \nThe physical severity of the performance in Afisinas film questions the rationalization of other forms of violence, and violence as a choice. Through its forceful portrayal of the relationship of violenceeven when well-intentionedto pain, the work suggests that its immediacy and familiarity may also be fundamental to producing a shared sense of compassion for ones fellow man, regardless of religion.\nJune Yap\n",

Transgressing the rigidity of architecture, Albenda's minimal, sensual forms, which he terms \"site co-optive\" as opposed to site-specific, create eerie environments by carefully upsetting the architectural logic of built space.Albenda's Portal to Another Dimension (Deborah)/Positive and Portal to Another Dimension (Deborah)/Negative (2001) push and pull against the walls they inhabit, turning architecture that was once solid and uncompromising into an outlandish, fluid spatial zone. Their titles' reference to \"another dimension\" foregrounds Albenda's utopian fascination with the possibility of other experiences of space beyond traditional Cartesian space, which allows for the depiction and experience of only three dimensions. In endeavoring to add a fourth, Albenda seeks both to challenge and expand human perception.Kevin Lotery\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nExploring the darker side of femininity and socially constructed notions of desire, Patty Chang often takes a corporeal, visceral approach to performance, an art form that underlies her work in video and photography. Like female pioneers of performance in the 1970s, such as Marina Abramovic, Eleanor Antin, and Hannah Wilke, Chang uses her body to address issues of the objectification of women and their representation in art history and popular culture. Chang's work is often inflected with humor and often pushes commercial and popular female stereotypes to their extreme. In the photograph Melons (1998), for example, she uses cantaloupes as prosthetic breasts. How consumption and desire are inscribed upon the female body is addressed in Chang's art, but equally so is a womans own desire of self.Chang drinks her own image in Fountain (1999), the photographic series in which she, like Narcissus in the Greek myth, is transfixed by her own reflection in a pool of water, an act driven by both vanity and necessity. She explores the objectification and exoticization of Asian women in coy works such as Contortionist (2000), a photograph in which the artist gazes knowingly at the camera as she appears in the pose of a Chinese acrobat with legs resting on her own shoulders. Chang uses metaphor in works such as Losing Ground (2001), a video work that visually alludes to Andrew Wyeth's painting Christina's World (1948) and depicts Chang on a suburban lawn that is curiously destabilizing.Much as Janine Antoni, Sally Mann, and Gillian Wearing have explored the sexuality and conflicts inherent to the parent-child relationship, Chang examines the territory of the primal, parental connection in her work In Love (2001). In this dual-channel video, two separate scenes of the artist with a parent are juxtaposed. Chang faces her mother and, in the adjacent frame, appears facetoface with her father. Simultaneously both images show the artist's and respective parent's faces pressed together in what at first appears to be a deep kiss. Gradually it becomes evident that the video is running in reverse time, and that they share not a kiss but rather an onion from which they both eat. They bite into it slowly, pausing as they take turns offering it to each other, as if it suggests the proverbial, forbidden fruit. Parent and child swallow before they take additional bites, blinking hard to hold back tears from the onions sharpness and pungency. However, in the video's reversal of time, the onion is reconstituted and the tears disappearwholeness is thus regained.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nDuring the late 1990s, Thomas Flechtner compiled what may be one of the most extensive photographic examinations of snow made to date. His large-scale prints swell with the stuff. Horizon lines, when visible, remain well inside the upper registers of the frames. Many of the pictures edge toward the monochromatic, their whiteness interrupted only by shadows or spare architecture. As a resident of La Sagne, in the Jura region of Switzerland, Flechtner worked from experience: with every winter's snowstorms, roads disappear, residents leave town, and life comes to a standstill. It is in these conditions that the photographer made his work, venturing by skis into the cold and barren landscape.Flechtner completed four series of snow photographs, in which the drifts increasingly overwhelm signs of life. In Colder (19962000), Flechtnerwho began his career photographing architecturefocused on La Chaux de Fonds, a town near his home. In these night scenes, the buildings' lights seem like bastions of life under siege of the weather, and they cast brilliant colors on the highly reflective whiteness. The hotels and parking decks at high mountain passes in the Passes series (19972001) are abandoned and partially buried. With the sky indistinguishable from the ground, the structures float in a silvery whiteness that dominates the compositions. In Walks (19982001), Flechtner used his skis to carve banded patterns into untrammeled fields of snow, capturing his actions with exposures of up to five hours. These systematic interventions into the landscape refigure the image of humanity against the elements in an elegantly formal manner. Finally, Frozen (2000) presents icy landscapes so hostile that humanity is altogether absent. This series was photographed in Greenland and Iceland, where Flechtner had traveled in hopes of creating more of his Walks; however, violent storms persistently erased his patterns. Turning to the desolate landscape itself, he created stunningly empty visions of what seems like another planet, where the snow exists in a sublime environment of blue and white light.\n",

Since 1990 he has worked with such commonplace household items as toothpaste, cubes of sugar, cereal boxes, Pepto-Bismol, and Life Savers. With painstakingly labor-intensive and time-consuming craftsmanship, Friedman transforms these modest resources into delicate, whimsical, and uncanny objects, ranging from self-portraits to abstract geometric configurations. Past works include a perfect sphere molded out of approximately 1500 pieces of chewed bubblegum, a likeness of the artist carved from a single tablet of aspirin, and a tangled, three-dimensional loop produced by gluing together the ends of a pound of cooked spaghetti.Phenomena at both the micro and macro levels are recurring subjects of Friedman's practice. For two pieces from 1990, the artist created shimmering nebulae out of laundry detergent and red-eraser shavings, and in other sculptures, a construction of polystyrene insulation and Styrofoam balls or a cluster of various types and sizes of sports balls resemble models of DNA or atomic particles. The Guggenheim's untitled sculpturea starburst-shaped network of chicken wire with painted Styrofoam orbsis more ambiguous and could represent equally the interstellar or the molecular worlds.

    "description": "\nDescription\nUsing time, memory, and the texture of everyday experience as his mediums, Pierre Huyghe conflates the traditional dichotomy between art and life. Working in an array of cultural formatsfrom billboards and television broadcasts to community celebrations and museum exhibitionshe reformulates their codes and deploys them as catalysts for creating new experiential possibilities. A mode of perception that lies in the interstices between reality and its representation is the subject of his two-channel video, The Third Memory, which reenacts the 1972 hold-up of a Brooklyn bank immortalized in Sidney Lumet's acclaimed film Dog Day Afternoon (1975). Almost 30 years later, Huyghe provides a platform for the heist's charismatic mastermind, John Wojtowicz, to relate his version of that infamous day in a reconstructed set of the bank. However, rather than clarify the personal history that Hollywood wrested from him, Wojtowicz appears to have been heavily influenced by the film, a testament to the inextricable merging of real events, the distortions of memory, and the mediating power of popular culture.The tension between fact and fiction is also at play in One Million Kingdoms, a work conceived as part of the collaborative project No Ghost Just a Shell, in which a manga character named Annlee is inserted into multiple artistic contexts. In Huyghe's animation, this adolescent girl wanders through a shifting lunar topography and, speaking in a digitally synthesized form of astronaut Neil Armstrong's voice, delivers a narration blending the actual transmissions from the Apollo 11 mission with excerpts from Jules Verne's 1864 novel Journey to the Center of the Earth. Annlee appears as a translucent outline, an empty cipher for creative interpretation. Yet at the same time, she is literally the author of her own environment: the mutating features of the landscape through which she walks are generated by the inflections of her own voice. Huyghe's own experience provides the starting point for This is not a time for dreaming. The film documents a puppet show that tells the parallel stories of the modernist architect Le Corbusier's commission to design the Carpenter Center for Visual Arts at Harvard University, and Huyghe's own commission to create an artwork to celebrate the building's 40th anniversary. Shifting back and forth in time, the narrative weaves together historical and contemporary events with fantastical elements, in an allegorical representation of the struggles and compromises inherent in the creative process.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nGlenn Ligon explores questions of African American identity and queer sexuality in a variety of media. He is best known for his paintings incorporating texts by influential cultural figures ranging from writers James Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston, and Jean Genet to comedian Richard Pryor. In works Ligon made for the seminal series Door Paintings (199092), the artist used black oil stick to stencil repeated phrases such as I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background and I remember the very day that I became colored (both from Hurstons 1928 essay, How It Feels to Be Colored Me) on primed white wooden doors. As Ligon worked, he allowed the oil stick to clog the stencil and smudge across the paintings surface, causing the phrases to blur and become less decipherable as they progress to the bottom of the panel. By disturbing the legibility of the texts, Ligon slows and interrupts the process of reading, collapsing it into seeing. The relentless repetition of a single phrase, detached from its original context, encourages the viewer to continually reevaluate the possible meanings of the text until it becomes thick with implication. The act of coloring these doors, with their human scale and subtle allusions to opportunity, passing, and passages, is analogous to the manner in which black bodies are inscribed with meaning within American society. In this sense, these initial works perform one implication of Hurstons text and question the ways in which bodies and images become legible within culture. Ligon later extended this technique to canvas and drew on quotes from activist Jesse Jackson, writer Ralph Ellison, and rapper Ice Cube, among others.\nLigons Coloring series, begun in 2000, further explores themes of becoming colored and the legibility of black bodies, but focuses on images rather than text. In a series of workshops Ligon conducted at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, the artist asked young children to color pictures from 1970s-era coloring books featuring African American cultural figures, which had been created to foster knowledge of black history and pride in black culture among African American children. Ligon then used the childrens work as source material for a series of paintings, screenprinting the coloring-book pages onto canvas and coloring them as in the childrens drawings, although with paint and oil stick. The results are often jarring: deaf to the ideology of the images, the young workshop participants colored irreverently, giving Frederick Douglass blue eyes and adding lipstick, rouge, and eye shadow to a portrait of Malcolm X. Some illustrations are filled in carefully, while others are obliterated by dense scribbles. At once playful and disturbing, Ligons paintings highlight the slippery nature of representation, and the apparent desecration of these cultural icons provokes an anxiety in the viewer that exposes the ideologically loaded process of reading an image. By highlighting this process, Ligon emphasizes the unsettling extent to which the meaning of an image is socially determined, and questions the ways in which we transmit our systems of meaning to future generations. \nLiz Blackford \n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nPaul McCarthy is perhaps best known for his psychologically disturbing, taboo-shattering performances. Since the 1970s, McCarthy has used his own body and an expanding cast of props, from common foodstuffs suggestive of body parts and bodily fluidshot dogs, hamburger meat, ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaiseto masks and prosthetic limbs, in staged scenes of shocking sexuality and brutality. McCarthy regularly transgresses the boundary between public and private and intentionally provokes discomfort and even revulsion on the part of his viewers in order to probe the sinister underside of American society. The center of his focus in this regard has been the family; in performances that mine children's television and appropriate characters such as Pinocchio and Heidi, McCarthy regularly examines how children are socially conditioned by parents as well as the mass media, and suggests dysfunction and violence bubbling beneath happy surfaces presented by popular culture.\nIn the early 1990s McCarthy began to regularly create static figurative sculptures independent from his performances. Figures in stuffed animal costumes engaged in sexual acts and grotesque personages such as Spaghetti Man (1993)a full-size rabbit-headed action figure with a freakishly long, flaccid phallus that coils on the floorcontinued McCarthy's strategy of merging themes of childhood innocence and adult perversion. The Guggenheim Museum's Michael Jackson (Fucked Up), Silicon (2001), reveals McCarthy's ongoing engagement with popular culture as well as art-historical narratives. The sculpture is one of a series of take-offs that McCarthy has created from Jeff Koons's iconic sculpture Michael Jackson and Bubbles (1988). While Koons's flawless porcelain depiction of the pop superstar and his simian sidekick was a celebration of fame and the highly stylized mechanisms used to generate such celebrity, McCarthy's first spin-off, made in 1999, presented a mutant portrait with cartoonish large heads and feet. In the more recent Guggenheim version, the proportions have become even more distorted and the features more abstracted; the entire piece is executed in a strategically careless, rough-hewn manner. In place of Koons's saccharine kitsch figurine, McCarthy's sculpture suggests the darker connotations of Jackson's fame, namely, the allegations of child molestation that played out in the media and the courtroom.\n",

What began as candid images of his and his friends lifestyles are now seen as iconic documents of a generation. McGinleys early photographs show androgynous, often-nude youths raving, hanging precariously from rooftops, shoplifting, running, falling, cavorting, and living with hedonistic abandon, exuberance, and rebellion. While initially capturing youth culture in an urban context, in 2003 McGinley began to place his subjects in the natural world, constructing loose situations that would inspire spontaneous actions. Throughout, McGinleys friends have been willing collaborators, keenly aware of the camera while displaying a transcendent candor, as they help to create enticing visions of a new bohemian coterie. In a later series of 200406, McGinley photographed fans of the musician Morrissey whom he did not know personally, though he had intimate knowledge of their milieu, having also been a fan himself. Here, while following Morrisseys tours for two years, he portrays the enraptured experience of individuals lost in their devotion to an idol.\n",

By questioning sexual politics, Neshat reveals something of the collective condition, its rituals, conflicts, and emotions. In Passage, a group of men carry a body wrapped in white cloth across a beach; in the distance, a group of women veiled in black chadors dig a grave with their hands, while a child arranges a circle of stones. These minimal, enigmatic scenes, set to a haunting score by Philip Glass, were filmed in the Moroccan coastal town of Essaouira. The location, where Neshat has worked before, is similar in character to the landscape of Iran: as Neshats work becomes better known in the West, she is increasingly uneasy about returning. But geography is almost secondary to the film. Inspired by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, specifically the televised images of bodies held aloft during funeral processions, Passage may be Neshats most timely and affecting film yet.Meghan Dailey\r\n        ",

His El Sueno de una cosa (The dream of a thing, 2001), consists of a 60-second film, the white panels on which the film is projected, and the silence that follows. The moving-image element consists of brilliant postcard views of a Norwegian hillside, set to music by French composer Edgar Varese; next to it, a glow-in-the dark label provides the work's title. The five white panels that act as a screen, revealed after the lights go up, are a replication of Robert Rauschenberg's White Painting (1951). During the 4 minutes and 33 seconds before the film starts again, viewers might imagine experiencing a sort of disembodied version of John Cage's 4-minute 33-second silent score (1962; itself inspired in part by Rauschenberg's painting). But this is just how the work is shown in a gallery context; the film component was originally conceived for movie theaters throughout Sweden in 2001, shown between advertisements and the feature films. Duplicating exactly the duration of the ads, it was an alien intrusion into the realm of commerce and entertainment.Meghan Dailey\n",

A map and instructions guide viewers (and sometime-participants) through the environment, which is vaguely urban but signifies nowhere in particular. Along the way, one encounters a McDonald's stand where hamburgers and french fries can be prepared and consumed; a DJ booth with turntables; the iconic furnishings from Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion (192829); and a replica of the megalith Unite dHabitation (194752), Corbusier's housing block in Marseilleall built to scale.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn Gregory Crewdson's photographs, suburban America is besieged by inexplicable, uncanny occurrences. His elaborately staged panoramas often elicit comparisons to the films of Alfred Hitchcock, David Lynch, and Steven Spielberg. Although he eschews the clarity of narrative film, Crewdson engages with his material as a director might, going to great lengths to construct fictional realms, recently employing a crew of up to thirty-five to help realize his cinematic visions.In Crewdson's work, meaning is kept just out of reach, where it lurks like a repressed trauma. His early Natural Wonder series (199297) focused on wildlifebirds, worms, and insectsforced to the edges of suburbia. These scenes take on the air of mysterious rituals. In one photograph, several birds have created a circular clearing in the grass and lined it with their speckled eggs, over which they stand guard. In another image, dozens of butterflies converge in a frenzied mass, smothering whatever lies beneath them. These ambiguous activities go entirely unnoticed by people, although a human presence is often suggested in the photographs by placid houses in the background. In his series Hover (199697), Crewdson turns to the human realm and explores its darker aspects. Abandoning the close-up views of Natural Wonder for higher, more expansive camera angles, these black-and-white photographs offer glimpses into private backyard sanctums in which disturbing acts occur: a man kneels over a woman who has collapsed and is inexplicably bound by festive balloons; elsewhere, a man obsessively mows his lawn in ever-larger concentric circles.Crewdson's most recent series, Twilight (19982002), returns to those uncanny suburban motifs, staging them in a more elaborate manner. These dark-toned images are illuminated by shafts of light, as if from some outside force making contact with the inhabitants of the pictured world. In Untitled (pregnant woman/pool) (1999), a woman stands in a small inflatable swimming pool as celestial beams of light shine prophetically on her pregnant belly. The characters often seem lost in internal reverie, like the family members at dinner confronted by their naked mother coming in from the garden. They share physical space but are emotionally lost to one another. The Twilight photographs are self-consciously staged, yet the sense of drama and mystery permeating the scenes compels viewers to overlook this artifice. Like all the artists work, these images suggest that at the heart of the American dream of property and privacy, emerging where least expected, darkness lurks.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\n\"Sometimes making something leads to nothing, sometimes making nothing leads to something.\" The seemingly paradoxical logic of this statement, uttered by the artist himself, informs the work of Francis Alys. His works often begin as simple actions performed by himself or commissioned volunteers, which are recorded in photographs, film, and other means of documentation such as postcards. Many of his projects are generated during the artist's \"walks,\" or paseos, in which he traverses city streets. In these works, Alys proposes witty updates to Baudelaire's figure of the 19th-century flaneur. His first walk was The Collector (199192), in which he strolled through the streets of Mexico City pulling a small metal \"dog\" by a leash, its magnetic wheels collecting the city's detritus in its wake. In Paradox of Praxis (1997), the artist pushed a large block of ice down the streets for hours until it was reduced to a mere puddle. For The Leak (1995), he roamed the streets of Ghent with a punctured can of paint, leaving a sort of Jackson Pollocklike bread-crumb trail back to a gallery space, where he finally mounted the empty paint can to the wall. Alys's endeavors often exceed the dimensions of discrete objects. In 2002 a group of some five hundred volunteers armed with shovels formed a line at the end of a massive, 1,600-foot sand dune and began moving the sand about four inches from its original location. This epic project, When Faith Moves Mountains (Cuando la fe mueve montanas, 2002), was completed for the Third Ibero-American Biennial of Lima in a desolate landscape just outside the Peruvian capital. The work is neither a traditional sculpture nor an earthwork, and nothing was added or built in the landscape. That the participants managed to move the dune only a small distance mattered less than the potential for mythmaking in their collective act; what was \"made\" then was a powerful allegory, a metaphor for human will, and an occasion for a story to be told and potentially passed on endlessly in the oral tradition. For Alys, the transitory nature of such an action is the stuff of contemporary myth.\n",

Each of the five main sculptural components, abstracted from cars competing in a demolition derby set in the lobby of the Chrysler Building around 1930, bears the insignia of a specific CREMASTER episode and embodies the conflicts explored in the film cycle. As an abridged version of the cycle, Chrysler Imperial exemplifies how Barney distills cinematic narrative into sculptural dimensionsusing his signature Vaseline and cast plasticsto extrapolate in space what he explores in time. In the narrative sequence that generated Chrysler Imperial, Barney's character, a Masonic candidate who eventually cheats on his initiation rites, is seen troweling cement over the fuel-tank valves on the rear chassis of five 1967 Chrysler Crown Imperials, transforming them into battering rams. The '67 Imperials encircle a 1930 Chrysler Imperial New Yorker like hunters around an animal in a snare and proceed to pulverize their victim in what appears to be a ritual killing. Once crushed, the New Yorker is transformed into a set of chrome dentures, which are fitted in the mouth of the Masonic candidate after his teeth had been shattered on a railing as punishment for his trespasses. The sculpture that evolved from these filmic interludes is conceived in six major parts: five abstracted car forms representing the Imperials (and by extension the CREMASTER installments) and one plastic rod representing the pulverized New Yorker's transformation into disciplinary dentures. \r\n\r\nNancy Spector \r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMatthew Barney's CREMASTER cycle (19942002) is a self-enclosed aesthetic system consisting of five feature-length films that explore processes of creation. The cycle unfolds not just cinematically but also through the photographs, drawings, sculptures, and installations the artist produces in conjunction with each episode. Its conceptual departure point is the male cremaster muscle, which controls testicular contractions in response to external stimuli. The project is rife with anatomical allusions to the position of the reproductive organs during the embryonic process of sexual differentiation: CREMASTER 1 (1995) represents the most \"ascended\" or undifferentiated state; CREMASTER 5 (1997), the most \"descended\" or differentiated. The cycle repeatedly returns to those moments during early sexual development in which the outcome of the process is still unknownin Barney's metaphoric universe, these moments represent a condition of pure potentiality.CREMASTER 1 takes place in the Bronco Stadium in Boise, Idaho. The film parodies the musical extravaganzas of Busby Berkeley as filtered through the lens of Leni Riefenstahl's Third Reich athletics. Chorus girls form outlines of reproductive organs on a football field, their movements determined from above by a starlet, who inhabits two blimps simultaneously and creates anatomical diagrams by lining up rows of grapes. CREMASTER 2 (1999) alternates between the Columbia Icefield in Canada and the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. It is a gothic Western premised loosely on the real-life story of Gary Gilmore, who was executed in Utah for murder. Gilmore's biography is conveyed through a series of fantastic sequences, including a seance to signify his conception and a prison rodeo staged in a cast-salt arena to represent his death by firing squad. CREMASTER 3 (2002) is part zombie thriller, part gangster film. As the final installment completed in the series, the film is a distillation of Barney's major themes, filtered through a symbolic matrix involving Freemasonry, Celtic lore, and coded references to the CREMASTER cycle itself. Set in New York's Chrysler Building, CREMASTER 3 also includes detours to the Guggenheim Museum, to the harness track in Saratoga Springs, and to Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. CREMASTER 4 (1994) is set on the Isle of Man, where a motorbike race traverses the landscape, a tap-dancing satyr writhes his way through an underwater canal, and three fairies picnic on a grassy knoll. Part vaudeville, part Victorian comedy of manners, and part road movie, this film portrays sheer drive in its struggle to surpass itself. Set in Budapest, CREMASTER 5 is performed as an opera complete with Jacobin pigeons, a lovelorn queen, and her tragic hero. The narrative flows from the Hungarian State Opera House to the Gellert Baths, which is inhabited by water sprites frolicking in a pool of pearls. As the cycle's concluding chapter, the film traces the story of final release, a physical transcendence that is misunderstood and mourned as loss.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWhere can we draw the line between nature and culture? And how do we as individuals fit into the relationship between the two? Since the early 1990s Olafur Eliasson has been making installations and series of photographs that consistently address such questions. His works consider the problems of representing and perceiving natural phenomena. To make them, he has constructed a waterfall in a museum courtyard, grown edible mushrooms on rotting tree trunks, and cut a hole in a gallery roof, allowing a disk of sunlight to move across the floor. Each process is put in motion through basic mechanisms and simple materialssunlight, water, ordinary garden hosesthat are plainly visible to spectators. The processes can unfold very slowly, allowing viewers time to contemplate what Eliasson characterizes as a discrepancy between the experience of seeing and the knowledge or expectation of what we are seeing.By re-creating natural phenomena within or around artificial sites, Eliasson exposes moments of disjuncture between reality and representation. In this context, his use of photography is apt. As a medium, photography is especially relevant to explorations of the dialectic between nature and artifice, representation and reality. Eliasson considers his photographs as sketches for his installations and does not exhibit the two bodies of work together. Usually arranged in a grid format, these landscape studies show natural phenomena, such as rivers, caves, and glaciers, mostly in Iceland. Eliasson intentionally selects points of view that highlight viewers' bodily relations to the pictured scenes, choosing disembodied aerial shots or close-ups that reinforce the artist's own presence. When exhibited as a series, the individual images create a cumulative sense of the terrain and the slow progression of geological activity, such as glaciers melting or continental plates shifting. Eliasson ultimately foregrounds our own presence in the face of these colossal changes, and his re-creations and interventions upon natural phenomena are a means of investigating perception itself.\n",

The video's protagonist, Achille, appears in both locations, first working as a waiter at a brilliantly colorful tropical resort and later wandering through bleak and gray London housing projects. Dreamlike scenes of the ocean and a lively party in an immigrant's apartment speak to the beauty of his world; vignettes of a burning cabin and domestic brutality also imply that violence and anxiety lie just beneath the surface.Over the course of the video, Achille becomes a sort of Everyman, symbolizing the Caribbean diaspora. Inspired by Saint Lucian author Derek Walcott's extended poem Omeros (1990), which took its own title from epic poet Homer's name in ancient Greek, Paradise Omeros constructs a deeply personal yet mythic narrative of the Creolea hybrid identity that encompass multiple cultures, histories, and sites of origin.Nat Trotman\n",

As benign as they may initially seem, however, the doll-like figures are strangely unsettling. With their porcelain, flawless skin and vacant, glassy eyes, the children seem more like lifeless automatons than living, breathing human beings.Loretta Lux creates these disquieting images by taking carefully staged photographs of the children of her friends against a white wall in her studio. She then inserts their digitized images over scans of her hand-painted or separately photographed backgroundsusually empty landscapes or stark, anonymous interiors, as in Hidden Rooms 1 (2001) and Study of a Boy 2 (2002). A painter by training, Lux cites Old Masters such as Agnolo Bronzino, Francisco Goya, Philipp Otto Runge, and Diego Velazquez as her influences. Using a computer, Lux works like a painter, digitally tweaking her solitary figures and their backgrounds in subtle ways until she is satisfied. In the final images, the children, while still identifiable, lose their appearance as individuals. Rather than studies of particular children, they are what she calls \"imaginary portraits,\" artificial creations that eerily merge childhood innocence and adult alienation.Ted Mann\r\n        ",

For One Moment in Time (kitchen) (2002), Monk projected slides of one-line text descriptions of family snapshots instead of showing the photos themselves. The notion of art as a means of communication also underlies Day &amp; Night (April 20, 2002).

In its emphatic reminder of hisand the recipient'sexistence, this ongoing piece recalls a similar effort by artist On Kawara, for which he periodically sends telegrams to friends that say, I am still alive.

    "description": "\nDescription\nTo view the Internet through one of Mark Napier's interfaces is to glimpse a landscape of unlimited visual possibilities. Napier's work is richer and more complex than the familiar print-inspired pages offered by corporate browsers like Netscape and Explorer. For example, Shredder (1998) chops up any Web page into slivers of text and image, de-emphasizing the public face of a site while foregrounding such fine print as button icons and JavaScript code that make the site function.Napier has created net.flag, an emblem for the Internet as a new territory, one composed of people from various geographical regions and ideologies. Its design changes constantly, manipulated by users who make selections from menus of familiar flag motifs: stars, fields of color, bold patterns, insignia, and stripes. As viewers add their contributions to the palimpsest, the cumulative identity of the flag changes as one country's insignia or symbols temporarily overlap those of another. Expanding upon the model of nongeographic nationalities such as Roma, net.flag permits viewers to customize and save personal flags for their own virtual domains. Since each element of a flag generally represents a symbol chosen by that country's founders, net.flag also includes a \"browse history\" feature that permits access to the evolution of its net symbolic valuethat is, the percentage of signs indicating \"peace,\" \"valor,\" or \"blood\" present in the flag at a given moment by its aggregate components.In a world where global trade, facilitated by telecommunication and e-commerce, has blurred national borders, nationalism in general had seemed increasingly to be losing its relevanceuntil September 11, 2001. In the months following the attacks, nationalistic fervor increasingly gave way to the realization that isolated sovereignty was untenable in a global economy. What happens to an emblem of solitary statehood when that state's internal affairs become entangled with geopolitical commitments? How can the notion of a flag reflect the new reality rather than pining for a nostalgic sovereignty that no longer exists? net.flag is one answer to those questions.Jon Ippolito\n",

The landscape and residents of Asti, the artist's hometown in northern Italy, were the subject of his photographic series I Pensatori di buchi (The Thinkers of Holes, 2002). First, the artist and his father spent several months digging large holes on their property, initially softening the soil by burning it. Then Perrone photographed young men from town, either clothed or naked, sitting at the edges of the openings. Perrone's manipulation of the land recalls 1970s Earthworks, and the collision of human beings and nature connects his practice to Arte Povera; like those Italian artists, Perrone explores the interchange between art, life, and the natural world. For Come suggestionati da quello che dietro loro rimane fermo (As if Fascinated by what Remains Still in the Background, 1999), he photographed elderly residents of Asti holding large animal horns and antlers. The juxtaposition of aging flesh and hardened organic material is a compelling existential metaphor that also lends a mythical, almost talismanic quality to the images.Meghan Dailey\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn 1977 Richard Prince lined up four advertisements for home furnishings torn from the New York Times Magazine, rephotographed them, and presented them as Untitled (living rooms)a deceptively simple gesture that represented not only a decisive breakthrough in his own practice, but a cornerstone of the postmodernist assault on conventions of authorship and originality. The artist's day job in the tear-sheet department of Time Life Publications allowed him to immerse himself in a world of consumer aspiration, as he scoured the discarded pages for images of fashion models, popular brands, and luxury goods, from which he cropped out all text and logos to reveal a series of highly codified visual tropes. In the triptych Untitled (jewels, watch and pocketbook), high-end accessories are positioned against a background of foliage and bathed in a beatific golden lightan attempt to invoke the natural world that only highlights the bizarre artifice of this carefully orchestrated act of seduction. At the same time that these appropriated photographs undermine the manipulative strategies of the advertising industry, their alien beauty exerts a mesmerizing appeal, exhibiting a simultaneous embrace and critique of mass culture that is at the core of Prince's art.In 1985, Prince adapted his appropriative method to a new series in which recycled jokes are silkscreened across monochromatic canvases, evoking a deadpan, off-the-shelf aesthetic. Jokes are a highly ritualistic form of social exchange, and in Prince's hands these apparently trivial statements find renewed power as cultural signifiers, focusing on gender stereotypes, sexual anxiety, and family dysfunction. My Neighbor exemplifies a later, more subtly allusive iteration of Prince's Jokes, in which the canvas is swathed in successive layers of mottled pigment and the gag line hand-stenciled in broken snatches so that it hovers on the periphery of legibility. A similar trajectory toward a more gestural style can be traced in the ongoing series of sculptures that Prince initiated in the late 1980s, which appropriate fiberglass car hoods advertised in the back pages of muscle-car magazines. While Prince farmed out his earliest Hoods to body shops to achieve a slick commercial finish, in more recent works such as Children, he uses their surfaces as supports for expressionistic hand-painting. Oscillating between the conditions of painting and sculpture, these abstracted objects retain the visceral associations of their origins, evoking the reckless allure of the open road and an attendant, prototypically American fantasy of rebellion and escape.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nGerhard Richter has stated, I am suspicious regarding the image of reality which our senses convey to us and which is incomplete and limited, and his insistence on the illusionistic nature of painting has led to a painterly practice that underscores the mediated experience of reality by incorporating imagery based on found and familiar photographs. Atlas, a vast compilation of such imagery begun in 1962 and expanded over the years, is testimony to the importance of photography within Richters oeuvre. From the artists perspective, photographs provide a pretext for a painting, injecting a measure of objectivity and eliminating the processes of apprehension and interpretation. While not based on a specific photographic source, the mirrorlike forms of Passage, with their muted gray and white palette and formal austerity, lack any emotive presence, a trait that is in keeping with the artists efforts to question and demystify the traditions of high culture.In Seascape, Richter combines various tropes of painting and photography to create a kind of representational problem: how and when does the eye sense the difference between a painted surface and the photographically recorded? In this seemingly conventional, large-scale work, the pigment is thinly applied, resulting in a surface that emulates the flatness of a photograph. And, like a snapshot might be, it is blurred, literally obscuring the distinction between the photographic and the painted. Here Richter draws from sources both traditional (the moody, atmospheric landscapes of German, Romantic painter Casper David Friedrich) and popular (vacation snapshots) to achieve this meditation on the nature of looking.While Seascape makes reference to a half-captured moment, the tinted panels of Eight Gray reflect a shadowy, perpetually shifting image. The eight enameled monochromes of this commission for the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin exist somewhere between painting, sculpture, and architecture. Installed in relation to the vertical gallery windows, the opposing rows of colored mirrors can be individually tilted at various angles to produce an endless sequence of reflections of interior and street views, confusing pictorial and actual space. Richters choice of gray denies the possibilities for association, differentiation, or interpretation. At once opaque and reflective, Eight Gray is simultaneously abstract and representational, presenting a monochromatic field as well as a reflected likeness of the viewer that emphasizes individual perceptions over a predetermined, unified experience.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nJohn F. Simon Jr. departs from the artistic tradition of creating one-of-a-kind images in favor of crafting one-of-a-kind computer programs, each of which quickly generates a wealth of images. Simon, who makes drawings on paper as well as computer-animated, wall-mounted panels and Web projects, draws inspiration from artists such as Paul Klee and Sol LeWitt, whose work alludes to or invokes rule-based, algorithm-like procedures. Simon is particularly interested in the way that the visual experiments of these artists can be automated and accelerated using digital technologies.Simon describes his Internet-based work Unfolding Object as \"an endless book that rewrites itself and whose use dictates its content.\" Originally a blank square visible on a Web page, the object unfolds in response to the virtual tugs of visitors from across the globe. As new facets branch off the original shape, each is patterned with a visual graphic that reflects the state of the object at the time the facet was created. For example, each leaf of this \"book\" that has been turned four times in the past is marked with four vertical lines; a horizontal line, meanwhile, stands for ten such unfoldings. As a shape that records the actions of users over a network, Unfolding Object recalls Simon's 199598 project Alter Stats, which translated hits from online visitors into a three-dimensional graph. Unfolding Object, however, is less a mathematical construct than a visual or even tactile one; it transforms clicks and pings into collaborative sculpture in virtual space.Rather than isolating the viewer in a cul-de-sac of individual experience, Unfolding Object places the beholder in a communal, although virtual, space. For this is an object, and a space, shared by the users whose fingerprints are left on the pages they unfold. Facets that have already been unfolded darken with their distance from the central square, but a facet that has not yet been altered rewards its discoverer with a brightly colored figure untouched by previous markings. No matter how \"dog-eared\" Simon's pages may become with future interactions, his object will always hold the potential for fresh discoveries by many individual explorers.Jon Ippolito\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nSimon Starling's work playfully explores the intimate relationships between craft, material, and technique. His investigations into and reflections on modern manufacturing and traditional crafts reveal countless nuanced contradictions in the production of a single object as well as a fascination with process. His works, which are part utopian vision, part critical commentary on mass production, are often achieved through elaborate, performative projects.While Starling is mostly a creator of scenarios and objects, he has documented his constructions with photographs to indicate the stages of their making and various component parts. In HOME-MADE EAMES (FORMERS, JIGS &amp; MOLDS) (2002), Starling undertook the transformation of a historically significant cultural object, here an Eames-designed fiberglass chair, into handmade copies. The object is reinvigorated as its very history is teased out. Four photographs show the molds and the tools used in replicating the original chair. The Eamess classic DSS chair, designed in 1948, was the first industrially manufactured plastic chair. Its mass production reflected the utopian vision of modernism, which imagined a world in which everyone could enjoy the benefits of classic, clean, utilitarian design. Today, vintage Eames chairs are collectors' items, available only to those with disposable income and discerning taste. Starling's inventive at-home attempt at replication underscores the contradictions inherent to modernism's legacy. Further, in crudely replicating this now iconic chair, he inverts traditions, resuscitating the past and pushing the established boundaries between art and life.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMoving freely from one genre to another, intermingling them in exhibitions and publications, Thomas Struth brings an intense level of visual exactitude to the images he creates. While the subject matter variesfrom a mist-laden view of a Japanese temple and a close-up of a sunflower to a pensive family portrait and a picture of the Louvre crowded with visitorsthe fundamental theme of his practice does not change. Struth's photography contemplates the science of observation. Eschewing narrative devices and intentional psychological allusions, the work augments vision itself by bringing into focus details too numerous for the eye to capture in an instant. A Struth image does not freeze time in the conventional sense of documentary photography; instead it slows time down just enough to capture the myriad visual nuances that one can only experience through sustained examination.Struth's early black-and-white cityscapesimages of barren urban streets photographed from one central perspectiveelicit comparisons to Bernd and Hilla Becher's typological studies of industrial structures. Struth had studied with the couple at the Academy of Fine Arts in Dusseldorf during the 1970s and shared their systematic, objective approach to subject matter. But it was another of Struth's professors at the Academy, Gerhard Richter, who made a lasting impression on the young artist's work. Richter's conceptual engagement with the photographic and his practice of working in simultaneous series is evident in Struth's own ongoing series of landscapes, street scenes, flowers, portraits, museum interiors, and places of worship. The Richter Family I, Cologne is a penetrating depiction of the artist's former mentor with his wife and young children.Struth's photographs of historic churches and temples, which function today as both religious sites and tourist destinations, always include people. Like his museum interiors, images of places such as San Zaccaria in Venice and the Buddhist monastery Todai-Ji in Nara, Japan, portray visitors in various stages of absorption. In Milan Cathedral (Interior), these visitors turn away from the camera to survey their environment, observe the Renaissance paintings, study their guidebooks, or pray. Shot at an oblique angle and lit with the utmost clarity, this dynamic composition captures both the complexity of the cathedral's celebrated architecture and the many separate vignettes being enacted by the individuals present at the moment the photograph was taken.\n",

Though his work has had a tremendous impact on the studied casualness of much recent fashion photography, Tillmans is not a \"fashion photographer.\" If anything he is a portraitist who often photographs his friendswho appear alternately tough, vulnerable, loving, ferocious, gay, and straightin intimate situations. Though these probing images reflect his own subjective experiences, they also operate on a more general level, recording a specific dimension of our contemporary culture. Tillmans establishes a collaborative process with his models, whom he calls \"accomplices.\" Thus the informal look of the works belies their choreographed construction. Landscape and still-life images also play a crucial role in his oeuvre, in which half-eaten fruit, sewer rats, crumpled clothing, or urban skylines are photographed with the same dignity and attention to beauty as his human subjects. Traditional subject genres are questioned; crumpled clothing might suggest a figure or landscape, while city scenes seen from the air resemble a still life of objects.For Tillmans, the images are only half the work; the installation or layout constitutes its completion. He affixes his prints directly to the wall with pins or tape, juxtaposing old and new images of varying sizes and mediums. He eschews standard darkroom procedures, blurring the lines between color and black and white (printing black-and-white images on color paper, for instance). Color photographs are placed next to inkjet prints and next to postcards and magazine clippings of his own images, contesting conventional hierarchies of scale and subject matter while drawing focus to the materiality of the photographic medium all within a carefully composed environment that seems to disdain permanency.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nSince the early 1990s Rirkrit Tiravanija has aligned his artistic production with an ethic of social engagement, often inviting viewers to inhabit and activate his work. Prioritizing the experiential and participatory over the self-contained object, he blurs the lines between Conceptual, performance, and installation art. In one of his most well-known series, Tiravanija rejected traditional art objects altogether and instead cooked and served food for exhibition visitors. His work recalls Joseph Beuys's conception of performance as social sculpture and facilitates interactions between viewers that, although simple and playful, can demonstrate the necessary foundation for community-based political actions. For The Land (begun in 1998), a collaborative artistic, architectural, and environmental recovery project in Sanpatong, Thailand, residents and artists are welcomed to use a plot of land as a laboratory for developmentcultivating rice, building sustainable houses, or channeling solar power.Because they insist upon the viewer's participation, Tiravanija's interventions are contingent upon their context. The variability of his works across international borders maps the global expansion of the art world and mirrors the nomadic nature of the artist's own life. The son of a Thai diplomat, Tiravanija was born in Buenos Aires, raised in Thailand, Ethiopia, and Canada, and with studios around the world, sustains a peripatetic lifestyle.While people remain central to his work, several of his projects incorporate reimagined physical structures or in his words, parallel spaces that operate as platforms for quotidian activity. Many of these spaces appropriate and transform the austere vocabulary of modernist architecture such as in Untitled: 1997 (Glass House) (1997). Erected in the Museum of Modern Art's sculpture garden, this work is a child-size version of Philip Johnson's famed Glass House (1949). Similarly, untitled 2002 (he promised) is a chrome and steel structure inspired by the modernist architect Rudolf M. Schindler's iconic Kings Road House in West Hollywood. While the structure exemplifies the spatial fluidity of Schindler's open-plan design, the reflective surfaces used to replace the wood and concrete of the original create what Tiravanija describes as a multifaceted image of reality, enlivening and multiplying the activities taking place in and around the work. When installed, it becomes an arena for a variety of programs, including DJ sessions, film screenings, panels, and children's workshops. In search of a shared utopia of experience, this work, as all in Tiravanija's oeuvre, reconstructs space as a living organism, susceptible and amenable to the flux of participation.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nBill Viola is a pioneer in the use of the moving image. He employs video, film, and audio technology to reveal his interest in conceptual and perceptual issues, as well as to realize his desire to engage with the history of art. Having worked with video since the early 1970s, Viola says that he has never lost faith in the image, and he has embraced new mediums while maintaining classical aesthetic values. Violas imagery has an immediate, visceral impact, but his temporal stretching and slowing of sensory experience through the use of art and technology deepens his works as vehicles of spiritual meditation. Viola's installations and artworks invoke both primal archetypes and a mystical spirituality. Going Forth By Day is an epic, five-part projection-based installation that addresses the complexity of human existence and explores cycles of birth, death, and rebirth. A different phase is embodied in each of the five looped projections with audio accompaniment. In one sequence, a community is shown anticipating and then fleeing from a deluge while another panel predicts a hopeful future as dawn illuminates a ravaged landscape. Each video is projected directly onto the wall of the exhibition space, just as the paint of a fresco adheres to the surface of a plaster wall. Viola acknowledges the influence of Giotto's fresco cycle in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua, a Renaissance work that, like Viola's installation, occupies an architectural space through which the viewer may physically pass.\n",

Each of the three videos is fashioned as a recording of a faux concert performance, using a technique reminiscent of what would have been employed to capture the event when it purportedly took place.Factory Archives (200102) imagines Ian Curtis, lead singer of the short-lived punk band Joy Division, through the grainy haze of aging video stock. As if retrieved from the vaults of Factory Records, this fragment depicts an elusive performer just before the dawn of MTV, when the choreographed music video would forever change how culture consumes its rock 'n' roll.

Its studied casualness and raw ambience evoke the countless bootleg videos that can be viewed on any number of websites devoted to all things Nirvana. In Recorded Yesterday (2004) Michael Jackson is seen performing his signature dance moves on an otherwise empty stage. The black-and-white, Super 8 film footage of this lone figure appears to be disintegrating as it plays, creating a ghostly, retro atmosphere that reflects the melancholic reality of a once brilliant career spiraling out of control. Each chapter of the trilogy appears worn and overexposed, as if distorted by age. The effect is one of a vaguely remembered image, a dream dimly recalled at the break of day.Bradley's \"restagings\" of these imagined performances reference specific moments in his own life when he first encountered the work of Joy Division, Nirvana, and Michael Jackson, and through them, the seduction of abandonment, the lure of celebrity, and the erotics of fan worship. His trilogyand its related photographs and collagescompellingly complicates the autobiographical element by the involvement of the artist's doppelganger. Since 1999 Bradley has been collaborating with Benjamin Brock, his veritable double, in a series of works that explore the psychologically charged space between one's self and mirror image. In myth and literature, the doppelganger is an apparition that portends one's own death, but its form has mutated over time to include the notion of double identity. In the trilogy Brock performs as Bradley playing the roles of Curtis, Cobain, and Jackson. Transformed by costume and posture, and further masked by the deteriorating stock on which he is seen, the doppelganger is at once everyone and no one. What emerges is a triangulation of reflections, an endless hall of mirrors that leads nowhere but to the recesses of the unconscious mind.Nancy Spector\n",

For her photographic project, Her, Her, Her, and Her (200203), she turned to one of the country's man-made landmarks: the Sundholl Reykjavikur, a 1928 indoor swimming pool complex. Horn was drawn to the building's locker rooms, which form a seemingly infinite maze of corridors and compartments with white tiles wrapping around every surface to form a single, unbroken continuum akin to a Mobius strip, and peepholes in the doors that produce an uninterrupted network of views. The artist captured the site's charged voyeurism by arranging individual photographs, taken from different positions and angles, into grids. In some of the images, the bodies of various women changing clothes appearthe hers of the titlebut they are obscured by the architecture or blurred in mid-action so that they remain inaccessible, ghostly traces.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn his prodigious and varied body of work, Dave Muller combines the roles of artist, curator, promoter, and cartographer. Since 1994, Muller has been arranging what he calls Three Day Weekends. Half-party, half-exhibition, these nomadic eventswhich Muller has staged in private residences, galleries, museums, and other locations in cities as farflung as Los Angeles, New York, Frankfurt, and Tokyocreate temporary, alternative spaces for displaying the artwork of friends and peers, spinning records, exchanging ideas, and simply bringing people together. Parallel to this activity, and in a similar spirit of self-effacing generosity, Muller has produced drawings and watercolors resembling exhibition announcements for other artists. Deftly rendered, these hand-crafted advertisements wittily engage issues of authorship and call attention to the social and institutional setting in which art operates. A former college DJ, Muller has brought the same keen interest in the mechanics of culture to the realm of popular music, creating watercolors of his and his friends record collections and wall drawings charting the evolution of rock and roll.In addition to mapping the fields of cultural production, Muller has turned to mapping real space. He has created several series of sprawling, multipanel paintings on paper that deal with the urban landscape in a diagrammatic way, beginning with A Theoretical View from the Roof of Dia (1999), set in New York, and continuing with The City at 11:16 am (2002), in San Francisco, Sprawling (200203), in Los Angeles, and The Northerly Set (200203), in Vancouver. Although these works contain isolated references to particular sites that Muller researched through photographssuch as the top of a building, or, in the panels pictured here, a balloon and a banner of flags that he noticed above an L.A. car dealershipthey are dominated by interchangeable panels of generic blue skies, marked by clouds and airplane contrails. Broken into separate groupings, and sometimes recombined with panels from other series, the works further lose their original reference. Muller is interested in this process of transformation and the potential for continual change. Rather than creating traditional, closed landscapes, he conceives of these installations as kits that the owner of the work can arrange and rearrange in various configurations on the wall, an open process he compares to his experience mixing as a DJ.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nFor over three decades, husband and wife collaborators Christo and Jeanne-Claude orchestrated large-scale interventions in both the man-made and natural environments, from wrapping such architectural landmarks as the Pont Neuf in Paris and the Reichstag in Berlin in fabric, to erecting a 24-mile fence of nylon through California's Sonoma and Marin counties. While monumental in scale and ambition, these projects undermine the notion of the solitary, heroic artistic genius; they are temporary, leaving no permanent mark on the sites, and their existence is owed to the collective efforts of hundreds of workers. Christo and Jeanne-Claude engaged in lengthy campaigns to persuade myriad public-interest groups, private landowners, and municipal and state authorities in order to win permission for their projects. This social process was central to their work; the pair proposed a fundamentally democratic vision of art, one that moves beyond the walls of the museum and into the space of the community to engage the widest possible audience.\nOne of Christo and Jeanne-Claude's last projects before Jeanne-Claude's death in 2009, The Gates transformed New York's Central Park with 7,500 gateways clad with saffron-colored synthetic fabric, covering 23 miles of park walkways. Originally conceived in 1979, the installation was granted permission by the city in 2003, and was on view for sixteen days in February 2005. This drawing is one of a number of preparatory studies that Christo created for The Gates, as he has done for all past projects. These studies were integral tools in Christo and Jean-Claude's lobbying efforts, allowing others to visualize the proposals. The proceeds from the sales of these works also provided the resources with which the artists financed the actual installations, allowing them to forswear all public or private funding. At the same time, such drawings and collages constitute finished works in their own right, revealing consummate draftsmanship and uncanny imagination.Ted Mann\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nJoana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige have collaborated since 1994 on videos, films, photographs, and installations that examine historical subjects while blurring the line between documentary and fiction. A central subject of their practice is the Lebanese Civil War (19751990) during which the artists came of age. Their works tend to complicate dominant narratives of the conflict by questioning the very act of representation. We dont show images of war, Hadjithomas and Joreige have stated, we show what war does to images.1In 2001, the artists discovered an undeveloped Super 8 film among the personal belongings of Joreiges maternal uncle Alfred Kettaneh Jr. The film, recorded in 1985 by Kettaneh shortly before he was kidnapped like 17,000 other Lebanese still missing from the civil war, became the source for this three-minute work titled Lasting Images. Some fifteen years after its creation, the artists developed the film, which by that point had survived a fire in Kettanehs home and the ravages of civil war. In the resulting short cinematic sequence, vibrating black lines and washes of abstract forms dissolve into images of everyday life: a boat, the bay of Beirut, and a group of figures gathering on a sunny day, with one man even mugging for the camera at the end. Despite the fog of the damaged film stock, these latent images persist. An image resurfaced, the artists reflected, an image that was still there, as though it could not be completely erased and remained present, albeit as a ghostly appearance. The works revelation, however, comes when the camera slowly zooms in on the landscape of the bay, a shot that suggests the cameramans presence. Though the film is visually understated it captures the author in a state of suspended animation as its lasting image.\nLauren Hinkson \n1.

Indeed, the artist has a driver's eye for his surroundings, and the titles of many of his works, such as WNTR PRK (2003), are abbreviated like the shorthand designations on freeway off-ramp signs. La Duke maintains the industrial theme in his materials, painting on sheets of airplane aluminum with military enamel. While the works depict gritty urban sprawl, their surfaces sparkle with affixed pieces of copper wire, glitter, and bits of glow-in-the-dark clay. Such highlights suggest the reflective quality of glass, metal, and street lights as they are apprehended by the eye.

    "description": "\nDescription\nBritish duo Tim Noble and Sue Webster entered the London art scene in the mid-1990s, just as Damien Hirst and others of the so-called \"Young British Artists\" were attracting increasing attention. Although the pair has remained at the periphery of the YBA group, their work reveals a fascination with the phenomenon of the artist as media-created celebrity. In Hijack (1994), they heralded their arrival through self-promotional posters in which they pasted their heads onto the bodies of the contemporary art world's most established artistic duo, Gilbert and George, and added the slogan \"Tim Noble and Sue Webster: The Simple Solution.\" A similar interest in the mechanics of advertising is evident in their light signs, in which trite phrases such as \"Forever\" and \"I love you\" or simple dollar signs are spelled out in gaudy, casino-inspired, blinking electric lights. Influenced by the Punk movement of the 1970s, Noble and Webster are also capable of aggressive shock tactics, as in their 1999 work The New Barbarians. The work recreates a diorama of early humanoids from the Museum of Natural History in New York with the couple's faces transposed onto the naked primitive bodies. Although attention grabbing, the work forms a remarkably unflattering and antiheroic, even vulnerable, self-portrait.Such unconventional self-portraiture lies at the crux of the series the couple is perhaps best known for, their shadow images. Carefully assembling seemingly random formations of ordinary junk or taxidermic animals and then lighting them from just the right angle, the artists achieve virtuoso likenesses in the resulting shadows. In some of the works, the shadows depict lighthearted, kitschy, or even romantic scenes that contrast sharply with the vulgar materials that create them: in a 1997 piece, a mound of discarded supermarket cartons and taxidermic seagulls is transformed into the couple seated back to back, cheerfully enjoying a glass of wine and a cigarette. Such pieces challenge our conventional notions of beauty, rehabilitating the detritus of society and turning it into something pleasing. The Guggenheim's work, Kiss of Death(2003), belongs to a group of decidedly darker and more macabre works. Here two clusters of taxidermic birds and rodents and animal bones create an image of Webster's and Noble's heads impaled on stakes, one of them gruesomely picked at by a crow. The illusion created is one of timeless, sublime horror, reminiscent of the work of Francisco Goya.Ted Mann\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nHaving long cultivated his status as a renegade, Richard Prince frequently traffics in American symbols of rebellion, such as motorcycles and cowboys. It is not surprising, then, that in 1987, during an extended stay in Los Angeles, he trained his focus on the subculture surrounding the American car. He began painting on muscle-car hoodsor more specifically, fiberglass reproductions of steel originals. He has said:With the hoods, I wanted to paint something that was already painted. I liked the way certain streetcars are painted. Flat, primed, flaked, the occasional stripe or decal or logo. There are advertisements for these hoods in the backs of car magazines. You send away for them. I get them through the mail. I use a body shop upstate to do the post-fabrication work. The bondwork, the sanding and spraying. I paint them specific car colors: Tor-red. Panther Pink. Grass Green. Lemon Twist. Plum Crazy. Vitamin C. Hugger Orange. I order certain models: Shelbys, Challengers, Chargers.1\nAs reproductions, the hoods Prince chose to work with can be seen in relation to his longstanding strategy of appropriation. Though he initially outsourced the spray painting of the hoods to body shops in order to give them an authentically slick finish, he eventually started painting them himself. Using a loose and gestural style, he transformed them into abstractions that bore little resemblance to the original hoods on which they were based. Mounted on the wall, as reliefs, or placed on pedestals as freestanding sculptures, the Hoods are ghostly, atmospheric, and deeply evocative artifacts.In the early 2000s Prince gutted the interior of a run-down tract house on the outskirts of Rensselaerville, in upstate New York. He created an exhibition space for the Hoods inside the stripped-down structure, which he called Second House (200107), in reference to a Los Angeles bungalow he had appropriated in the early 1990s (First House, 1993). The working-class setting (the house was once used as a hunting camp) was ideal for exhibiting the Hoods, which represent a yearning for a free-and-easy lifestyle unencumbered by obligations to conform or aspire to a bourgeois existence.

Following this logic, Ritchie set out to develop an ongoing, alternative narrative for the genesis of the universe, and in the mid-1990s, he created a basic code that consists of 49 different colors, characters, natural elements, and attributes. These infinitely interchangeable components form the basis for his sprawling, multipart installations, such as The Proposition Player (2003). The title refers to the casino employee who engages unsuspecting customers into a game. In that installation, Ritchiesymbolically assuming the role of proposition playeruses gambling as a metaphor for unpredictable occurrences by giving museumgoers an opportunity to roll the dice and participate in a game of chance. The Hierarchy Problem (2003) consists of four, separately titled parts from The Proposition Player: a graffiti-like wall mural, an image illuminated on a light box, a maplike configuration of rubber cutouts on the floor, and a painting depicting tangled, densely wrought forms. Entitled Snake Eyes, the painting refers to the potential outcome of a roll of the dice, and represents the moment right before the Big Bang in the artists epic narrative.Meghan Dailey\n",

In the early 1960s, Serra and the Minimalist artists of his generation turned to unconventional, industrial materials and began to accentuate the physical properties of their work. Relieved of its symbolic role, freed from the traditional pedestal, and introduced into the real space of the viewer, sculpture took on a new relationship to the spectator whose phenomenological experience of an object became crucial to its meaning. Viewers were encouraged to move aroundand sometimes on, in, or throughthe works, many of which cannot be fully understood without peripatetic examination. Over the years Serra has expanded his spatial and temporal approach to sculpture and has focused primarily on large-scale, site-specific works that create a dialogue with a particular architectural, urban, or landscape setting.\nSnake, a work made for the inauguration of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, consists of three enormous, serpentine ribbons of hot-rolled steel that are permanently installed in the museum's Fish gallery. Although it weighs around 180 tons, the colossal work is experienced through its negative spaces. The two tilted, snaking passages, capture a rare sense of motion and instability. Snake preceded Serra's Torqued Ellipses, the artist's most recent rumination on the physicality of space and the nature of sculpture. Both Snake and the Torqued Ellipses seem to defy gravity and logic, making solid metal appear as malleable as felt. Shifting in unexpected ways as viewers walk in and around them, these sculptures create surprising experiences of space and balance, and provoke a dizzying sensation of steel and space in motion.\n",

For Varejao, works of art are vital, living organisms, and her sculptural, relief-like paintings are meant to be read as bodies, both individual and social. In Folds 2 (2003), the pure, white tile skin ruptures, exposing the life-blood and organs that usually remain concealed beneath the surface. It is through this dialogue between the equally powerful forces of containment and revelation that Varejao's works transmit deeper allegorical and metaphorical significance. In their architectural aspect, the reliefs suggest ruins or sites of archeological excavation. What is unearthed in the process are potentially ugly truths (primarily the troublesome legacies of colonialism and cannibalism, both bodily and racial, that Varejao references explicitly) that are also essential to existence. Indeed, Brazil's dynamic, hybrid visual culture, with its roots in Baroque-era Catholic iconography, Portuguese art, indigenous customs, and transplanted Asian and African traditions, was borne of forces both beautiful and horrible. Varejao's artstartling, visceral, and aliveis the contemporary articulation of these diverse influences.Meghan Dailey\r\n        ",

Since the early 1990s, Zittel has been designing alternative structures for living under the guise of her fictive one-person corporation, AZ Administrative Services.  For her AZ Wagon Stations, begun in 2003, Zittel developed temporary living shelters that reference both the covered wagons of the old western frontier and the standard suburban station wagons of today. Although the Wagon Stations do not have wheels, they are easy to collapse, transport, and reassemble. Their small size allows them to evade building codes, providing the inhabitant with the potential for greater freedom and autonomy. As with Zittel's prior designs, the Wagon Stations are customized in various ways by their users. A number have been adapted by artists and other individuals for use at AZ West, the experimental live/work compound Zittel founded in 2000 in the desert near Joshua Tree, California. The Guggenheim has acquired two Wagon Stations: The first was customized by Russell Whitten, a longtime desert resident and dirt bike enthusiast, who painted the exterior with a hot rod design of red flames and employed it as a rest station at AZ West. The second, one of Zittel's unaltered prototypes, will be customized in consultation with the artist at a later date.Ted Mann\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe use of constructed tableaux has been a prominent strategy in photography of the past several decades. From Thomas Demands life-size paper and cardboard models to Gregory Crewdsons elaborate, Hollywood-style mise-en-scenes, a number of artists have employed sets and props in ways that call into question the veracity of the photographic medium. In her ambitious Tree Planting series (200205), Sarah Anne Johnsonwho once worked as an assistant on one of Crewdsons projects, as well as on set construction for film and theater productionshas adopted and modified this strategy. Rather than blurring the line between reality and fiction in single images, Johnson maintains a separation between the two, mixing them only in her final installation on the exhibition wall.The 65 photographs in Tree Planting chronicle what has become a rite-of-passage for many Canadians, planting trees in deforested areas of Manitoba. The young adults who participate in these conservation trips are paid per sapling, but what keeps them returning, says the artist, is the rewarding sense of community and connection to the land that the work engenders. Johnson records the ritual with two types of images: photographs of actual people and locals that she took over the course of three summers, and shots of hand-crafted clay dolls and miniature dioramas that she constructed later in her studio. Shuffled together salon-style on the wall, these two sets of images stand in tension, but they also complement one another to present a more complete account of the experience, expressing the mundane, physical realities of the laborbug bites, bandaged arms, rain-soaked and mud-caked clothesand, simultaneously, the sublimity of nature and a nostalgic longing for what Johnson calls \"the closest thing Ive found to Utopia.\"The images in Tree Planting vary in scale and format and range from portraits to figureless landscapes, giving the overall installation the impression of a private scrapbook. However, Johnsons intention for the work extends well beyond the merely personal. Her \"quietly political agenda\" is to persuade others of \"the empowering emotion born in good old-fashioned hard work for an important cause.\"\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nNo artist had a greater influence in revealing the artistic potential lurking behind televisions flickering facade than Nam June Paik. Commonly hailed as the father of video art, Paik reshaped perceptions of the electronic image through a prodigious output of manipulated TV sets, live performances, global television broadcasts, single-channel videos, and video installations. His career took him from Asia through Europe to the United States, and Paiks complex media-based art grew out of his early interests in electronics, as well as his foundations in performance and music. Arriving in New York in the mid-1960s, he joined a new generation of artists that was altering the ways in which one interacts with the moving image. Paik became a prominent member of the Fluxus movement, whose principles included the transformation of quotidian actionslike the buttoning and unbuttoning of a coat, as seen in his video Button Happening (ca. 1965)into art. Quickly emerging at the forefront of this movement, Paik also sought to involve the viewer as an active participant in his performances and installations, and he often introduced elements of surprise and the unfamiliar.TV Garden (1974), one of his seminal installations, illustrates Paiks profound grasp of technologys capacity for composition and the new aesthetic discourse that he helped to create. To enter the piece is to experience an uncanny fusion of the natural and the scientific, as hidden amid an undergrowth of live plants are video monitors of various sizes. All are playing the artists 1973 collaboration with John J. Godfrey, Global Groove, which montages performers from around the world into a gyrating visual mix, and the videotapes sound track serves as musical and spoken counterpoint to the monitors flickers of light. TV Garden set a new standard for immersive, site-specific video installations. Restaged for the artists exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in 2000, its influence can be seen decades later in ambient, room-sized installations by such artists as Gary Hill and Bill Viola.For Paik, the artist should not be limited in seeking new forms of creative expression, but rather the potential for innovation must be continually reimagined. Just as Paik reconceived broadcast television in the 1960s and 1970s in order to turn it inside out and deliver a fresh take on this means of communication, Paik turned to laser technology as a novel type of sculptural and installation art at the beginning of the 21st century. He continued to dismantle customary ways of seeing and expand the parameters of art making throughout his career.John Hanhardt/Megan Fontanella\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThis installation draws its content from Herge's comic book series Les aventures de Tintin (The Adventures of Tintin, 192983), in particular Tintin au pays de l'or noir (Land of Black Gold). First published serially between 1939 and 1940, the comic was set in the British Mandate of Palestine and revolved around conflicts among Zionist Jews, insurgent Arabs, and colonial British troops. However, when preparing the English edition in 1972, Herge altered the plot significantly, removing all reference to Britain and relocating the story to the fictional kingdom of Khemed. Here Allen assembles the two complete editions of the comic as long strips that unfurl in tandem, beginning identically but soon diverging into a jumble of disparate images. To signify the malleability of the narrative, he removed all dialogue from the speech bubbles. Allen thus provides a unique view into the shifting political terrain of the mid-20th century, suggesting the ways that Israelis and Palestinians have found themselves spoken for by the economic and religious struggles of their region throughout much of the last century.Nat TrotmanThe Land of Black Gold (detail), 2004.

Peering into its recessed platforms and reflected inner cavities, however, one is confronted by several ghoulish specimens: decomposing werewolf heads and body parts, frighteningly realized in plaster and fake hair. The figure of the man/beastwith its long lineage from ancient Greek myth to Victorian gothic tales to Hollywood B-movieslies at the center of Altmejd's fantastical and cryptic iconography. While Altmejd's monsters do not participate in any kind of resolvable narrative, they nevertheless serve as potent symbols of transformation. Rather than simply rot, his werewolves undergo postmortem metamorphosis, their carcasses sprouting crystals and jewels. Along with the handmade plastic flowers and birds that are scattered throughout the piece, the overall effect of these bejeweled remains is one of beauty. Despite its dark content, Altmejd's work offers a hopeful vision: with decay comes the promise of regeneration. Altmejd conceives of his installations as living organisms pulsing with potential energy, and he has described the labyrinthine architectural structures that house his creatures as the systems that both trigger and circulate this energy.Ted Mann\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nNigel Cooke's meticulously crafted and conceptually challenging paintings thrive upon dualities and contradictions and demand active, sustained viewing. Often immense in scale, they are minutely rendered with dark, eccentric details that confound initial impressions, precluding the kind of immediate, overall reading from the single vantage point common to much contemporary painting. Cooke has likened the dynamic in his works to Russian nesting dolls, with multiple pictures within pictures.\nFrom a distance, many of the large canvases Cooke painted between 2001 and 2005 resemble limitless landscapes dominated by vast, empty skies, calling to mind Romantic-era representations of the sublime, awesome scope of nature. Mummy (2004), for example, conjures a sprawling, icy tundra with echoes of the Northern landscapes of the 19th-century German painter Caspar David Friedrich. Viewed at closer proximity, however, it becomes evident that the skies in such works are actually flat walls marked by graffiti. Rather than representing deep space, these pictures present a stiflingly shallow area, with only a tiny patch of foreground; rather than depicting the sublimity of untrammeled nature, they suggest an urban wasteland characterized by decay and entropy.\nThrough the trope of secondary images of graffiti, Cooke both complicates the authorship of his workssuggesting some agency other than his own at work within the paintingsand directs our attention to the mechanics of representation. The simple, cartoon style of the graffiti, which typically depict leering jack-o-lanterns or anthropomorphized fruit and vegetables (in Mummy, they include a smoking banana and pear), contrasts with the painstakingly detailed, trompe l'oeil rendering of the rocks and blades of grass in the foreground. At the same time, viewers are meant to understand that these are simply two different conventions of picture making on a flat ground. By layering different modes of picture making within a single canvas, Cooke challenges assumptions about high versus low art and gives pictorial form to questions of representation that have been center-stage in much of recent art history. His work, Cooke observes, is \"a death of painting played out as one big, bloated painting project.\"1\n1.

Each image in the series is a to-scale simulation of one of the iconic 1960s food paintings of Bay Area artist Wayne Thiebaudpaintings that themselves confound reality and representation by replicating cake frosting with the thick impasto of oil paint. Working from catalogue reproductions of the original canvases, Core painstakingly bakes and prepares the cakes, pies, candy, hot dogs, and other assorted treats, giving tangible form to what Thiebaud is said to have painted from memory. Through a mixture of frosting, sculpture, trompe-l'oeil painting, and manipulated lighting and camera angles, she faithfully reproduces Thiebaud's originals, capturing their colors, textures, shadows, and perspective. Core's images are not only as visually lush as Thiebaud's canvases, but they also raise a series of questions about the nature of mimesis and the boundary between reality and artifice.Ted Mann\r\n\r\n\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nUsing time, memory, and the texture of everyday experience as his mediums, Pierre Huyghe conflates the traditional dichotomy between art and life. Working in an array of cultural formatsfrom billboards and television broadcasts to community celebrations and museum exhibitionshe reformulates their codes and deploys them as catalysts for creating new experiential possibilities. A mode of perception that lies in the interstices between reality and its representation is the subject of his two-channel video The Third Memory (2000), which reenacts the 1972 hold-up of a Brooklyn bank immortalized in Sidney Lumets acclaimed film Dog Day Afternoon (1975). Almost 30 years later, Huyghe provides a platform for the heists charismatic mastermind, John Wojtowicz, to relate his version of that infamous day in a reconstructed set of the bank. However, rather than clarify the personal history that Hollywood wrested from him, Wojtowicz appears to have been heavily influenced by the film, a testament to the inextricable merging of real events, the distortions of memory, and the mediating power of popular culture.The tension between fact and fiction is also at play in One Million Kingdoms (2001), a work conceived as part of the collaborative project No Ghost Just a Shell, in which a manga character named Annlee is inserted into multiple artistic contexts. In Huyghes animation, this adolescent girl wanders through a shifting lunar topography and, speaking in a digitally synthesized form of astronaut Neil Armstrongs voice, delivers a narration blending the actual transmissions from the Apollo 11 mission with excerpts from Jules Vernes 1864 novel Journey to the Center of the Earth. Annlee appears as a translucent outline, an empty cipher for creative interpretation. Yet at the same time, she is literally the author of her own environment: the mutating features of the landscape through which she walks are generated by the inflections of her own voice.Huyghes own experience provides the starting point for This is not a time for dreaming (2004). The film documents a puppet show that tells the parallel stories of the modernist architect Le Corbusiers commission to design the Carpenter Center for Visual Arts at Harvard University, and Huyghes own commission to create an artwork to celebrate the buildings 40th anniversary. Shifting back and forth in time, the narrative weaves together historical and contemporary events with fantastical elements, in an allegorical representation of the struggles and compromises inherent in the creative process.Katherine Brinson\n",

From her early portraits of queer subcultures, pristine urban panoramas, and expansive landscapes to incisive views of her own domestic life, Opie has offered profound insights into the conditions in which communities form and the terms in which they are defined. Throughout her career, self-portraiture has served as a marker of personal and artistic development, as well as a reminder that she, as the photographer, does not stand apart from the groups she documents. In this vein, she made Self-Portrait/Cutting (1993) and Self-Portrait/Pervert (1994) alongside her renowned series portraying fellow members of San Franciscos queer leather subculture. Like those images, her self-portraits address contemporary concerns of queer identity, while couching their content in a formal tradition recalling the sixteenth-century paintings of Hans Holbein. In these images Opie offers something deeply personal, even confessional, revealing powerful longings that are compounded by the great physical vulnerability of the sadomasochistic acts the photographs document. Ten years later, in Self-Portrait/Nursing (2004), Opie returned to the genre, newly suffusing her image with a sense of rapturous contentment, as she holds her infant son in a classically maternal pose that further evokes art-historical imagery. Faintly but clearly visible on her chest, the word pervert still appears as a scar, a trace of her history that carries forward through time.\n",

After it disappears from view, two other planes are seen; slowly veering toward each other, they seem headed for certain collision, but their paths cross without an explosion and the aircrafts continue unscathed on their separate ways. This inexplicable pattern is repeated again and again, each time with more planes, until nearly 150 jets momentarily converge at a single point before peacefully dispersing. Paul Pfeiffer composed this mesmerizing play of tension and release by digitally mapping footage of individual planes onto the same composition.

In Pier and Ocean, he works on a larger scale (the image size is variable and can be projected at up to 14 feet) and with a subject that evokes contemporary associations but nevertheless resonates a sense of timelessness. The video's title alludes to Piet Mondrian's famous series of abstracted seascapes, which Pfeiffer's work recalls through its formal composition andnotwithstanding the implicit threat of violenceits sense of quiet contemplation and transcendence.Ted Mann\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nHaving long cultivated his status as a renegade, Richard Prince frequently traffics in American symbols of rebellion, such as motorcycles and cowboys. It is not surprising, then, that in 1987, during an extended stay in Los Angeles, he trained his focus on the subculture surrounding the American car. He began painting on muscle-car hoodsor more specifically, fiberglass reproductions of steel originals. He has said:With the hoods, I wanted to paint something that was already painted. I liked the way certain streetcars are painted. Flat, primed, flaked, the occasional stripe or decal or logo. There are advertisements for these hoods in the backs of car magazines. You send away for them. I get them through the mail. I use a body shop upstate to do the post-fabrication work. The bondwork, the sanding and spraying. I paint them specific car colors: Tor-red. Panther Pink. Grass Green. Lemon Twist. Plum Crazy. Vitamin C. Hugger Orange. I order certain models: Shelbys, Challengers, Chargers.1\nAs reproductions, the hoods Prince chose to work with can be seen in relation to his longstanding strategy of appropriation. Though he initially outsourced the spray painting of the hoods to body shops in order to give them an authentically slick finish, he eventually started painting them himself. Using a loose and gestural style, he transformed them into abstractions that bore little resemblance to the original hoods on which they were based. Mounted on the wall, as reliefs, or placed on pedestals as freestanding sculptures, the Hoods are ghostly, atmospheric, and deeply evocative artifacts.In the early 2000s Prince gutted the interior of a run-down tract house on the outskirts of Rensselaerville, in upstate New York. He created an exhibition space for the Hoods inside the stripped-down structure, which he called Second House (200107), in reference to a Los Angeles bungalow he had appropriated in the early 1990s (First House, 1993). The working-class setting (the house was once used as a hunting camp) was ideal for exhibiting the Hoods, which represent a yearning for a free-and-easy lifestyle unencumbered by obligations to conform or aspire to a bourgeois existence.

While they recall graffiti art, Rhodes marks on brick walls and playground pavements serve as a means to an end: the artist incorporates his own body and interacts with his drawn objects in pantomimelike performances that are recorded as either sequential photographs, like the chronophotographs of Eadweard Muybridge, or stop-motion animations. For Street Gym, a 2000 performance originally presented in photographic format and transformed into a digital animation in 2004, Rhode was shot from above as he lay on the pavement and enacted high-bar gymnastics with the aid of a chalk-drawn pole and cartoon motion lines. In the animation, the illusion is further enhanced by the fluctuating tempo of the changing frames, which slows as he reaches equilibrium above the pole and speeds up for his virtuosic dismount. In its blend of humor and social commentary, Street Gym is typical for Rhode: his performances regularly exploit stereotypes of the young black male as star athlete (a related work shows the artist performing an impossible somersault slam dunk) or thug (another piece simulates a car theft). Street Gym also engages the age-old issue of mimesis in art, simultaneously exploiting the tensions between the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional, the vertical and the horizontal, and the real and the represented.Ted Mann\n",

In the early 1960s, Serra and the Minimalist artists of his generation turned to unconventional, industrial materials and began to accentuate the physical properties of their work.

In staged videos and photographs, she has decorated herself and her friends with balloons and inflated condoms to enact hybrid creatures with bloblike appendages; these strange specimens are usually set in watery landscapes. Tschape's latest video, Lacrimacorpus, takes place in a man-made interior and evokes history as well as myth. The setting is the castle of Ettersburg near Weimar, which the artist was drawn to because of its dual history as both a summer residence of Goethe (who composed poems on its grounds) and a building overlooking the Nazi concentration camp of Buchenwald. In the video, a female figure, adorned in a costume from Goethe's time, dances in an empty hall until collapsing to the floor. Her spinning motion, along with the frame of the room, the mechanical winding noise at the video's beginning, and the chiming music, evokes a child's music box. This playful allusion and the setting's pristine elegance lie in tension with the site's tragic history. The work's title, Latin for \"tear body,\" suggests that the bubbles of inflated latex attached to the dancer are a cascade of tearsa silent expression of her buried sadness.Ted Mann\n",

Wearing has employed various kinds of masksfrom literal disguises to voice dubbingto conceal the physical identities of her subjects and allow them to reveal their innermost secrets. Often this has entailed surprising leaps in age: In one video, adult actors lip-synch the audio-recorded confessions of adolescents; in another, adults wearing plastic masks of generic children divulge traumatic experiences from their youths. For her Album series in 2003, Wearing adapted this strategy to a more autobiographical end. Donning silicon prosthetics, she meticulously reconstructed old family snapshots, transforming herself into her mother, father, uncle, and brother as young adults or adolescents. In one photograph in the series, Wearing recreated her own self-portrait as a teenager. Self-Portrait at Three Years Old (2004) carries this role-playing further back in time. Confronting the viewer with her adult gaze through the eyeholes of the toddlers mask, Wearing plays on the rift between interior and exterior and raises a multitude of provocative questions about identity, memory, and the veracity of the photographic medium.Ted Mann\r\n        ",

Garaicoa inserts pins into the second panel and links them with colored thread to create delicate, ghostly drawingsbarely perceptible depending on the viewers angleof what has been lost.

Working from catalogue reproductions of the original canvases, Core painstakingly bakes and prepares the cakes, pies, candy, hot dogs, and other assorted treats, giving tangible form to what Thiebaud is said to have painted from memory. Through a mixture of frosting, sculpture, tromp-l'oeil painting, and manipulated lighting and camera angles, she faithfully reproduces Thiebaud's originals, capturing their colors, textures, shadows, and perspective. Core's images are not only as visually lush as Thiebaud's canvases, but they also raise a series of questions about the nature of mimesis and the boundary between reality and artifice.Ted Mann\r\n        ",

Gaskell's video Erasers (2005) takes a very different approach. In contrast to her richly chromatic images, with their irregular, baroque compositions, Erasers was shot in black and white and with the subjects all positioned in the same head-on format, lending it the appearance of a documentary. In preparation for the work, Gaskell conveyed the true story of a car accident she had experienced in her childhood to a group of teenage girls from Clinton Junior High School in New York. A week later, Gaskell filmed each girl individually as she candidly recounted the story as best as she could recall it. Through careful editing and shifts in voice, perspective, and time between the girls' retellings, Gaskell's video fragments the memory of the original event to create a new, dramatic version of the story. \n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nSouth African artist William Kentridge's work reflects a deep engagement with issues of history and memory. Using vigorously reworked charcoal and pastel drawings as the primary basis for his films, he leaves traces of erasure and highly visible pentimenti to suggest the work's process and an ineffaceable past. Kentridge is also known for his theatrical productions for which he crafts layered, multimedia performances combining objects and their cast shadows, puppets and puppeteers, as well as his signature traces and erasures into moving image projections and set designs. The artist's most recent work, Black Box/Chambre Noire, was initially conceived while the artist was preparing to direct a major theatrical production of Mozart's opera The Magic Flute, creating large-scale set designs and exploring actor staging and projections while utilizing a miniature stage maquette. That work on the Enlightenment-themed opera would lead to Black Box/Chambre Noire, which explores the darker implications of that era's philosophical legacy, reflecting the key process of reversal that so often takes center stage in the artist's work.The development of visual technologies and the history of colonialism intersect in Black Box/Chambre Noire through Kentridge's reflection on the history of the German colonial presence in Africa, particularly the German massacre of the Hereros in Southwest Africa (now Namibia) in 1904, an event considered by some historians to be the first genocide of the 20th century. In 1885 Southwest Africa became a German protectorate. German settlers increasingly encroached upon and expropriated the land of the Hereros. As the tribe's frustration rose, the Hereros, led by their chief Samuel Mahareru, launched a revolt against the ruling Germans. German troops, directed by General Lothar von Trotha, launched a swift counterstrike. Despite objections to General von Trotha's extreme measures by Germans in the colony as well as at home, it wasn't until 1905, after 75 percent of the Herero population was decimated, that the general was removed from command. In reflecting on this historical incident, Kentridge explores the Freudian concept of Trauerarbeit, or grief work, as a labor without end. This ongoing investigation dovetails with the artist's unrelenting and self-reflexive examination of process and meaning. In creating a work that reveals the motors of representation, Kentridge renders these means transparent, removing the veil behind which selective, subjective memories are crafted into grand narratives of history. Resisting closure, the work problematizes simplistic constructions of history using binaries of past and present, victim and victimizer, spectacle and spectator.\n",

Kamin Lertchaipraserts works are not, however, about the passage of time or the assembling of multiple parts. Rather, they are situated somewhere between these two things, and reflect on the immediate necessity of perseverance and practice in art and life. Lertchaipraserts work is inflected by his interest in Buddhist philosophy and meditation, particularly those associated with Theravada Buddhism, Thailands state religion and one of the Three Pillars of Society defined by King Rama VI (18811925). The cultivation of self-awareness that meditation entails is a recurring theme in the artists oeuvre, beginning with his earlier series Problem-Wisdom (199395), which also consists of papier mache sculptures and confronts the suffering brought on by a lack of empathy.\nThe folk-style figures in Sitting (Money) reference the idea of craft, thus relating the act of contemplation to the experiential and historical nature of production symbolized in the work. While Problem-Wisdom, is made of daily newspapers, Sitting (Money) is pieced together from decommissioned Bank of Thailand banknotes previously slated for recycling. These unique figures, while busy with everyday activities, share a meditative posture that references Buddha and his teachings. They embody a tension between Buddhist ideals and the realities of ordinary experience, appearing as if materially, spiritually, and physically tested. The part played by currency in this aesthetic transformation furthers the works contemporary existential challenge by conflating spiritual well-being with material wealth. \nYet making the familiar figure of the Buddha from cashthe lifeblood of a nations economyis not a simple indictment of contemporary materialism. Rather, it is for the artist a meditative response to the realities of his environment. In Lertchaipraserts practice, spirituality is not to be confused with transcendentalism, or with its link to Asian culture. For the artist, the character of the work is not only linked to Thai experience and religious belief, but also suggests universal human truths and experiences. It is in the artists attentiveness to material and spiritual change, as well as in his understanding of the human conditions impermanence, that the work exceeds the limits of religion and nationhood.\nJune Yap\n",

Like them, Sasnal introduces a layer of mediation to his work by painting from photographs and other secondary materials, which include, in his case, news images, comic books, art catalogues, album covers, and films and animations. His work recalls Richters in its use of blurring and free oscillation between figuration and abstraction, and Tuymanss with its careful cropping, sometimes chalky palette, and deliberately crude brushwork. However, while works by the more established German and Belgian display an unmistakable signature style, Sasnals paintings exhibit an encyclopedic eclecticism that eludes formal classification. More than anything, his prodigious output reveals a voracious, almost obsessive, drive to depict everything in our visual culture without hierarchy. In two independent, identically sized paintings acquired by the Guggenheim, this protean approach is evident: both are apparently derived from the same photograph of a bird feeder, but the relative definition and flat surface of one is replaced by the thick impasto and illegibility in the other. The subject of these works is not so much the bird feeder as it is the nature of perception and representation itself.Ted Mann\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWilhelm Sasnals (b. 1972, Tarnow, Poland) painting has frequently been compared to that of Gerhard Richter and Luc Tuymans. Like them, Sasnal introduces a layer of mediation to his work by painting from photographs and other secondary materials, which include, in his case, news images, comic books, art catalogues, album covers, and films and animations. His work recalls Richters in its use of blurring and free oscillation between figuration and abstraction, and Tuymanss with its careful cropping, sometimes chalky palette, and deliberately crude brushwork. However, while works by the more established German and Belgian display an unmistakable signature style, Sasnals paintings exhibit an encyclopedic eclecticism that eludes formal classification. More than anything, his prodigious output reveals a voracious, almost obsessive, drive to depict everything in our visual culture without hierarchy. In two independent, identically sized paintings acquired by the Guggenheim, this protean approach is evident: both are apparently derived from the same photograph of a bird feeder, but the relative definition and flat surface of one is replaced by the thick impasto and illegibility in the other. The subject of these works is not so much the bird feeder as it is the nature of perception and representation itself. Ted Mann\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nRichard Serra has long been acclaimed for his challenging and innovative work. As an emerging artist in the early 1960s, Serra helped change the nature of artistic production. Along with the Minimalist artists of his generation, he turned to unconventional, industrial materials and accentuated the physical properties of his work. Freed from the traditional pedestal or base and introduced into the real space of the viewer, sculpture took on a new relationship to the spectator, whose experience of an object became crucial to its meaning. Viewers were encouraged to move aroundand sometimes on, in, and throughthe work and encounter it from multiple perspectives. Over the years Serra has expanded his spatial and temporal approach to sculpture and has focused primarily on large-scale, site-specific works that create dialogue with a particular architectural, urban, or landscape setting.Snake, a work made for the inauguration of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, consists of three enormous, serpentine ribbons of hot-rolled steel that are permanently installed in the museum's largest gallery. The two tilted, snaking passages capture a rare sense of motion and instability.  Snake is now joined by seven commissioned works-creating the installation entitled The Matter of TimeSerra's most complete rumination on the physicality of space and the nature of sculpture.The Matter of Time enables the spectator to perceive the evolution of the artist's sculpted forms, from his relatively simple double ellipse to the more complex spiral. The final two works in this evolution are built from sections of toruses and spheres to create environments with differing effects on the viewer's movement and perception. Shifting in unexpected ways as viewers walk in and around them, these sculptures create a dizzying, unforgettable sensation of space in motion. The entirety of the room is part of the sculptural field: As with his other multipart sculptures, the artist purposefully organizes the works to move the viewer through them and their surrounding space. The layout of works in the gallery creates passages of space that are distinctly differentnarrow and wide, compressed and elongated, modest and toweringand always unanticipated. There is also the progression of time. There is the chronological time it takes to walk through and view The Matter of Time, between the beginning and end of the visit. And there is the experiential time, the fragments of visual and physical memory that linger and recombine and replay.\n",

After producing works inspired by his favorite directors and divas of the 1960s, he turned his attention to the phenomenon of the contemporary Hollywood blockbuster in 2005. For Trailer for the Remake of Gore Vidals Caligula, Vezzoli created a star-studded trailer for an imaginary big-budget remake of the controversial 1979 cult classic Caligula. Featuring Helen Mirren and Adriana Asti from the original cast as well as young stars such as Milla Jovovich and Courtney Love, the spoof trailer is a high-camp parody of the superficiality and vacuousness of Hollywood. It is also an attempt to return ownership of Caligula to its original screenplay writer, Gore Vidal, who distanced himself from the project after major disagreements with producer Bob Guccione and others. Not only is Vidals name restored to the title, but he also introduces the trailer, explaining his original vision for the film as an allegory of the universal tendency for unbridled power to lead to madness and violence. It is a lesson that Vezzoli suggests is particularly timely today. Ted Mann\r\n        ",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Banks Violette created a unique body of work that takes as its inspiration and subject the subculture of black metal, a dark genre within heavy metal. A fan and musician himself, Violette is interested in the suspension of disbelief engendered by the music's unabashed and often over-the-top nihilism and allusions to violence, which are ardently defended, and at times re-created, by the genre's dedicated fans. Violette's bleed (2005) is representative of his distinct, gothic vocabulary in its use of black epoxy to create shiny, seductive surfaces; its fusion of geological motifs with musical or theatrical sets; and its deployment of sound as a sculptural material. The center of the piece is occupied by a shattered black stage, with a pile of shards suggestive of the heady, destructive undercurrents of black metal. At the same time, the shards are referential of a landscape, recalling Robert Smithson's broken-glass sculptures of the 1960s. Violette's frequent use of saltevidenced here in the organic heaps that surround and encrust the speakersalso stems from his engagement with the work of Smithson, whose environmental artwork Spiral Jetty (1970) is continually renewed by the precipitation of salt over the Great Salt Lake in Utah.These visual elements are accompanied by a nonlinear ambient sound track by Stephen O'Malley, a composer and member of the metal group Sunn 0))). The extreme low-frequency droning produces a palpable, dense quality in the space between the speakers, the vibrations accumulating into an immediate, tactile, and even excruciating sensation for the viewer. The sculptural qualities of the auditory experience coalesce with the visual forms, immersing the spectator in a sinister and foreboding environment.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nSuling Wang's dynamic paintings, alternatively layered with bold swathes of paint and delicate brushstrokes, reveal the complex dualities of her artistic origins. Wang spent her childhood in rural Taiwan but moved to London to study art in 1993, where she has remained ever since. From traditional Oriental painting to manga to Disney cartooning, Eastern and Western influences coexist in Wang's work and speak to her multilayered artistic identity.\nWang's pictures are large in scale and draw on the gestural marks and loose brushstrokes that characterized the work of the Abstract Expressionists in the 1940s and 1950s. Wang clearly recognizes the expressive potential of this spontaneous mode of picture making, but she also incorporates a range of figurative motifs into the overall abstraction. In Cryptic Butterfly (2005), for example, thick and swirling lines of paint cut across translucent chromatic fields, which are further punctuated by \"imaginary landscapes,\" volumetric abstractions (wrapped in thin lines to simulate three-dimensionality), and calligraphic marks. The artist's dazzling color palette and pulsating brushstrokes infuse the painting with emotional fervor and drama. Meanwhile, meticulously rendered geographical forms (in Cryptic Butterfly, one detects sinuous roads, mountain jags, and mythic islands) anchor the composition and demand closer scrutiny. Such iconographic elements link Wang's art with the Chinese landscape tradition, in which serene depictions of nature offer a sanctuary from the ordinary world. In her complex work, painting and drawing, abstraction and figuration, are interwoven and at times wholly confused.\nThe pictorial density that characterizes Wang's paintings produces sensations of movement and depth. In Cryptic Butterfly black-and-white patterns, which recall Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely's Op art, offer discrete moments of three-dimensionality before metamorphosing into colored stipples. While localized forms are fixed to the canvas, streams of paint vibrate and flow through transparent compositional layers. Wang's rhythmic designs envelop her entire painting surface and even extend beyond the canvas edge, like a square of richly decorated fabric or a Jackson Pollock drip painting, to give the illusion of infinite space.\nWang's ambitious practice likewise explores dimensions of time and personal memory, as articulated in the blending, overlapping, and colliding of motifs on the pictorial plane. These disjointed forces that define her work express the social dislocation she felt in abandoning her native island and ultimately, her uncertain location as an artist. Despite finding inspiration in various modes of mark making from different art-historical periods and places, the traditions of her original Taiwanese culture still largely inform Wang's practice. Her ongoing struggle between the past and the present is keenly felt in each explosive picture.\n",

What began as candid images of his and his friends lifestyles are now seen as iconic documents of a generation. McGinleys early photographs show androgynous, often-nude youths raving, hanging precariously from rooftops, shoplifting, running, falling, cavorting, and living with hedonistic abandon, exuberance, and rebellion. While initially capturing youth culture in an urban context, in 2003 McGinley began to place his subjects in the natural world, constructing loose situations that would inspire spontaneous actions. Throughout, McGinleys friends have been willing collaborators, keenly aware of the camera while displaying a transcendent candor, as they help to create enticing visions of a new bohemian coterie. In a later series of 200406, McGinley photographed fans of the musician Morrissey whom he did not know personally, though he had intimate knowledge of their milieu, having also been a fan himself. Here, while following Morrisseys tours for two years, he portrays the enraptured experience of individuals lost in their devotion to an idol.\n",

Through these related elements, the figure of Mohammad bin Qasim, considered Pakistans early colonial founder in state history, is brought to life in a lighthearted and candid portrayal that provides an opportunity to reflect on the history of the South Asian nation. A young general from Umayyad (an early Islamic caliphate), bin Qasim rose to prominence as leader of the successful capture of Sindh in 711 CE. Attributed to this conquest is the introduction of early Islamic practice and philosophy to the region, which in Pakistans history is credited as predicating the destiny of the nation. The significance of this narrative resides, firstly, in its status as an alternative to Western-centric postcolonial narratives of independence that privilege European expansionist forays in South Asia since the 17th century and, secondly, in its circumvention of the complex conditions under which Pakistans independence as a modern nation-state was achievedvia a separation of the Muslim League from the Indian National Congress in 1943 through to the triumphant and traumatic aftermath of the partition of South Asia on August 14, 1947, which established East and West Pakistan. Beyond its geographical specificity, the work suggests the challenges of such singular narratives, and the inevitability of the contestation of multiple historical narratives.\nAbidi explores historical and contemporary representations of the figure of bin Qasim, and the proliferation of this narrative in state history and shared culture, through her fictional depictions of the hero in his emblematic formwearing the Arabic keffiyeh, brandishing a sword, and riding a charging horse. In The Boy Who Got Tired of Posing, the artist plays on the trend of popular studio photography in 1980s Pakistan, which saw parents encourage their sons to dress up as bin Qasim for portrait shots. In the works final image, the subject, tired of performing, mischievously elects to exit the frame. In This Video is a Reenactment, the artist recalls Labbaik, a televisual dramatization of the colonial founders conquest, by excerpting a sequence showing the heros momentous horseback ride. In Abidis video, however, the act is slowed down, accentuating its histrionic impact on the nation. Finally, in a suite of eight monochrome photographs, The Ghost of Mohammed Bin Qasim, the artist monumentalizes the figure, who appears to haunt various sites of national significance around Karachi including the Lahore Fort, the tomb of Emperor Jahangir, and the National Mausoleum of the founder of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, or Mazar-e-Quaid. Yet on closer examination, these glimpses of the return of the historical figure contain various incongruities and awkwardnesses. A short fictional text reveals the story of how the haunting began with the conversion of a young man, Yusof Masih, to Islam, and his imagining himself as bin Qasim.

Central to the story are the communications and miscommunications between the male protagonist, a knight who aids the evolution of plant life, and the female, who alternately takes the form of a princess and of a spaceship and is aligned with technological advancement. In the drawing Blackout Machine (2006), elements of the natural landscape transform into futuristic cathedral-like structures, with the flow of communication of the unseen characters illustrated by red and blue lines. The tension between nature and technology is mirrored by other dualities within the series: male/female, realism/abstraction, past/future, and architecture/landscape. To these themes Caivano adds references to abstract art, fractal geometry, molecular physics, DNA, medieval poetry, video games, and the Internet, forming an imaginative chronicle of the search for meaning in an infinitely complex universe.\n",

In costumes or street clothes, these anonymous figures dance and play music while other employees, unnoticing, continue to work around them.

But it is perhaps her compelling 16mm films for which the artist is best known. Dean's Kodak and Noir et Blanc (both 2006) address the approaching obsolescence of celluloid film, a format that is becoming increasingly scarce as it is replaced by digital alternatives. Dean became acutely aware of the threat to her chosen medium when she was unable to obtain standard 16mm black-and-white film for her camera. Upon discovering that the Kodak factory in Chalon-sur-Saone, France, was closing its film production facility, Dean obtained permission to document the manufacture of film at the factory, where cameras had never before been allowed. The resulting works, Noir et Blanc and Kodak, turn the medium on itself and constitute a contemplative elegy for the approaching demise of a medium. Both films follow the production of celluloid as it runs through several miles of machinery. Noir et Blanc was filmed on the final five rolls of 16mm black-and-white Kodak film that Dean had acquired, while Kodak captures the vivid luminosity of the material.\n",

Often enlarged from their source material for presentation on gallery walls, the resulting works examine a wide range of aesthetic and social concerns through a very personal lens. Photographs from the family archives that the artist has used to craft new images include depictions of the alcohol-induced exploits of his twenty-something siblings and friends as well as travel shots of Gardner family adventures through the mountains of North America. The carefree nature of the original photographs transformed by the painstaking detail of Gardners subsequent works recognizes memory as a system of representation while evoking rites of male and familial bonding. In a recent series executed in dialogue with the paintings collection at the National Gallery in London for his solo exhibition there, Gardner deepened his investigation of nature, revealing, through personal as well as advertising photographs, the wilderness to be a site as mediated and constructed as masculinity itself. In one pastel work from this series, Tobi on the Red River, Gardner restages his own snapshot of his little brother, replete with face-obscuring sunglasses and life vest, as they negotiate the great outdoors. Transforming the image from playful archive to work of high art, Gardner exposes the viewer to a fragile, personal act of remembering.Kevin Lotery\n",

Assembled from footage shot by seventeen synchronized cameras placed around the stadium, the film captures Zidane from multiple angles, from up close and afar, and remains steadfastly fixed on him even when the central action of the match moves elsewhere. Gordon and Parreno conceived of the project in relation to painted portraiture extending back to Francisco de Goya and Diego Velazquez as well as the more immediate precursor of Andy Warhols real-time film portraits. By splicing in footage from the live television broadcast, Gordon and Parreno complicate their film portrait, foregrounding the mediated nature of the spectacle. The dual-channel video version of Zidane acquired by the Guggenheim features a further layering: the cinematic version plays in one projection while the raw footage from one of the seventeen cameras plays beside it. On occasion, the two streams synch and show the same image. This doubling, a recurrent feature of Gordons work, both deepens the psychological complexity of the portrait and echoes the broader mass-dissemination of the celebrity-hero.Ted Mann\n",

The dark blue of this tenth monochrome shimmers in the grooves of hundreds of fine brush marks.

Lee's innovative body of work revolves around the notion of encounterseeing the bare existence of what is actually before us and focusing on \"the world as it is.\"\nBorn in Korea in 1936, Lee studied painting at the College of Fine Arts at Seoul National University and philosophy at Nihon University in Tokyo. He rose to prominence in the late 1960s as the leading theorist and practitioner of Mono-ha (School of Things), a Japanese art movement that developed from the collapse of colonial world orders, antiauthoritarian protests, and the rise of modernity critiques. Lee's sculptures, presenting dispersed arrangements of stones together with industrial materials like steel plates, rubber sheets, and glass panes, recast the discrete object as a network of relations based on parity between the viewer, materials, and site. Lee was also a pivotal figure in the Korean tansaekhwa (monochrome painting) school, which offered a fresh approach to minimalist abstraction by presenting repetitive gestural marks as bodily records of time's perpetual passage. Lee has coupled his artistic practice with a prodigious body of critical and philosophical writings.\nFor Lee, restraint in creating arteven letting what has been created disappearshifts the status of his works from that of material objects to fleeting lived experiences, and his nonproduction emerges as a nuanced critique of the Western societal prevalence of surplus and overproduction. Relatum, the title of all Lee's sculptures, is a philosophical term denoting things or events between which a relation exists. This radical approach to the artwork, not as an object but as a network of relationships, shifts artistic experience to an act of encounter, an occasion that unfolds around the viewer in a particular time and space. Since his early Mono-ha period, Lee has restricted his choice of materials to steel plates and stones, focusing on their precise conceptual and spatial juxtaposition. The steel platehard, heavy, solidis used to build things in the modern world; the stone, in its natural, as-is state, \"belongs to an unknown world,\" as the artist puts it, beyond the self and outside modernity, evoking the Other or \"externality.\"\nRelatumdialogue (2002/11) presents two steel sheets laid on top of one another, slightly askew, and flanked by two large rocks suggesting a model of identity and difference. Lee approaches his sculptures with the same attention to resonant space, emptiness, and stillness that is seen in his paintings. The rocks become like brush marks placed in a dynamic interplay with the surrounding space, which is always in flux. Lee does not seek to create permanent monuments, but rather to open up spaces for engagement through minimal intervention in disciplined acts of selecting and arranging.\r\n\nAlexandra Munroe\n",

What began as candid images of his and his friends lifestyles are now seen as iconic documents of a generation. McGinleys early photographs show androgynous, often-nude youths raving, hanging precariously from rooftops, shoplifting, running, falling, cavorting, and living with hedonistic abandon, exuberance, and rebellion. While initially capturing youth culture in an urban context, in 2003 McGinley began to place his subjects in the natural world, constructing loose situations that would inspire spontaneous actions. Throughout, McGinleys friends have been willing collaborators, keenly aware of the camera while displaying a transcendent candor, as they help to create enticing visions of a new bohemian coterie. In a later series of 200406, McGinley photographed fans of the musician Morrissey whom he did not know personally, though he had intimate knowledge of their milieu, having also been a fan himself.

Per Speculum (2006) is more universal in theme, offering an allegory for the nature of perception. The film begins with views of children inhabiting a timeless, pastoral Arcadia. As the camera zooms out to reveal that we are in fact looking at a reflection in a large mirror planted in the landscape, the idyllic scene is ruptured when one of the children shatters the mirror with a slingshot. In the film's second half, the children occupy the branches of a giant tree and use fragments of the broken mirror to reflect the sunlight so that the tree appears to magically sparkle. The work's title alludes to the famous passage in St. Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians (For now we see as through a glass, darkly . . . ), which addresses our imperfect and limited vision of reality. While Paci invokes the deception of the sensesand by extension, of mimetic representation, including filmhis departing image of the illuminated tree seems to nevertheless hold out the possibility of some form of transcendence, however illusory.Ted Mann\n",

The artist stages and films absurdist assembly lines in which womens bodies are harnessed toward consumer production. In several works, female bodybuilders and contortionists are shown engaged in mindlessly repetitive physical tasks, providing moisture for scented towelettes with their sweat or making maraschino cherries from their clipped fingernails. Dough (2006) depicts a team of women pulling a rope of dough through a series of claustrophobic factory compartments. At the center of the Rube Goldberglike system, an obese woman kneads and directs the dough. When a bouquet of flowers is placed before her, a chain reaction is set off: the flowers produce allergic tears, which fall to the floor and generate steam, which in turn causes the dough to rise before it is finally packaged. Equating industrial and bodily processes, the journey of the fleshy dough alludes to digestion, excretion, and birth. Dough evinces the influence of 1970s feminist body art and also recalls Matthew Barneys elaborate sets and surreal physical processes. Like Barney, Rottenberg gives sculptural form to her videos; here, the projection appears in a cramped wooden room, its outer supports weighed down by doughy sandbags.Ted Mann\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nTino Sehgal constructs situations that defy the traditional context of museum and gallery environments, focusing on the fleeting gestures and social subtleties of lived experience rather than on material objects. Relying exclusively on the human voice, bodily movement, and social interaction, Sehgal's works nevertheless fulfill all the parameters of a traditional artwork with the exception of inanimate materiality. They are presented continuously during the operating hours of the museum, they can be bought and sold, and, by virtue of being repeatable, they can persist over time.\nThe fact that Sehgal's works are produced in this way elicits a different kind of viewer: a visitor is no longer only a passive spectator, but one who bears a responsibility to shape and, at times, to contribute to the actual realization of the piece. A work may ask visitors what they think, but, more importantly, it underscores an individual's own agency in the museum environment. Regardless of whether they call for direct action or address the viewer in a more subtle sense, Sehgal's works always evoke questions of responsibility within an interpersonal relationship. His situations therefore produce meaning and value through a transformation of actions rather than solid materials, as was particularly evident during Sehgal's 2010 presentation of This Progress (2006) at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, when he stripped the Frank Lloyd Wrightdesigned rotunda of all physical artworks, and employed the iconic ramp as a platform for discourse.\nBecause of the individualized conception of Sehgal's work, experiences of each piece are highly subjective and might change dramatically on repeat visits, leading to discussions about a wide range of topics such as sustainability, economics, politics, social reform, or personal growth. These varied results from a single scenario are the crux of Sehgal's singularly elastic and provocative practice. By setting the stage for a conversation, rather than opting for more traditional one-way spectatorship, Sehgal puts the spectator and the work on equal footing, eradicating the implicit hierarchical relationship between the viewer and the work of art.\nClaire Barliant with Nat Trotman\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nFor over 15 years, Beat Streuli has produced spontaneous images of everyday people from large cities. Using a telephoto lens and natural light, the artist takes frontal shots of anonymous pedestrians who become his unwitting subjects as they cross streets, push strollers, catch buses, or in other words, as they go about the business of their daily lives. Streuli's work has much in common with traditional genres of picture taking, such as documentary photography, but it is not his intention to use these portraits as vehicles for social criticism, chronicles of typologies, or ruminations on exoticism. Even though many of his subjects represent identities quite distinct from his own, Streuli seeks to capture differences and commonalities in their realities and experiences in as neutral a manner as possible: \"You see people with lives very different from yours, and also people with lives similar to yours, having a sudden glimpse of a range of possibilities, ways of life, that makes me very curious, because after all, we only have one life and will not be able to experience many other possibilities . . . I look for public spaces where you can have a glimpse of the personal aspects of their lives.\"1\nThe element of the personal informed Bruxelles Midi (2006), a series of photographic portraits made in Brussels at the Bruxelles-Midi railway station and a nearby market, both of which are situated in proximity to the largely Muslim immigrant neighborhood where the artist lived at that time. The choice of locale distinguishes this work from a majority of his projects made during his travels to cities around the globe, including London, Osaka, Sydney, and Tel Aviv. When first displayed, Bruxelles Midi was shown as a floor-to-ceiling wallpaper installation. The series of pictures Streuli selected for this piece come together to form both a set of snapshots of individuals traversing public space and a continuous group portrait of a given time and place, namely Brussels at midday. The immersive environment created by this strip of images implicated the viewer in a scenario that is simultaneously foreign and familiar.\nAdaptable by nature to a given site, this and other works by Streuli can be presented in a variety of contexts, ranging from the white walls of the museum or gallery to the advertising space of urban billboards to the facades of buildings. By inserting these portraits into the cityscape, Streuli transforms them into mirrors, reflecting the everyday lives of passersby as well as the social implications of urban interactions.\n1.

The doubled letter in the modified brand name of the title refers to Jose Efrain Rios Montt, the military president of Guatemala in 1982 and 1983, who was responsible for the genocidal slaughter of members of the indigenous Ixil ethnic group. Minerva Cuevas has also hijacked the authority of the logo by replacing the self-congratulatory language of advertising with a potent message of political opposition on behalf of a long-subjugated population and landscape.\n",

Working on the floor over the canvas, Houshiary begins these works by drawing Arabic words that she repeats in delicate layers over an acrylic ground. The colored pencil markings are woven like a chant, their minute reverberation transitioning from legibility to invisibility to create an immersive immateriality in works like Presence (200607). The form of these works as well as the meaning of the words themselves are not of primary importance to Houshiary; rather, they are a starting point for an encounter with the sublime: I set out to capture my breath, to find the essence of my own existence, transcending name, nationality, cultures. Here, the calligraphic marks loosen in the center of the work to reveal a dark ring that collapses and disappears. With its play between lightness and darkness, form and formlessness, Presence invites extended contemplation and manifests a perceptual experience of the intangible.\nLauren Hinkson\n",

The 7 Lights is a series of large-scale projections in which digitally animated paper silhouettes appear as delicate shadows of natural elements, consumer objects, and the human form, all floating through the sky or tumbling down to Earth. Chan places a line through the word Light in the series' title as a literal reflection of the work's formlight and light that has been struck outand describes the sequence as a hallucinatory interpretation of the seven days of biblical Creation. In 6th Light, the outline of a windowpane is cast across the floor, mirroring an area of undulating green light on the wall. Amid an apparently catastrophic shower of abstracted shapes, evoking images of falling debris from a bombing or natural disaster, the architectural structure is shattered and dispersed. While this entropic breakdown of man-made order appears to be more closely aligned to concepts of apocalypse than creation, the restrained lyricism of the piece tempers the shock of violent dissolution with a sense of potential rebirth.\n",

His crisp monochrome images appear at first glance to be photographic or mechanical reproductions, but are in fact meticulously detailed pencil drawings. In a mimetic process that returns the artist's hand to the re-photography gesture pioneered by Pictures Generation artists such as Richard Prince and Sherrie Levine, Haendel photographs his pilfered images, projects them, and meticulously redraws thema painstaking method that negates the traditional associations of drawing as gestural and originary. The artist frequently configures the individual images into salon-style installations, grouped according to instinctive formal and thematic relationships. The eight-part work 5th Column Group (2007), brings together drawings of a family snapshot, a political bumper sticker, a New Yorker cartoon, an Internet image of a child wearing a dunce hat, an abstract scribble, a list of questions for the artist's father, and two posters of repeated slogans, confronting the viewer with both a deeply personal compilation and a more universal anthology of our collective cultural identity.Katherine Brinson\n",

While recalling the appropriation strategy of artists like Sherrie Levine who sought to critique the notion of originality by photographing other artists' work, Khan's composites are even more pronouncedly ambivalent in relation to their subjects. On the one hand they enact a kind of destruction by blurring the source materials to the point of almost complete illegibility, but at the same time, they embodyand pay tribute tothe sheer labor and singular vision of the original creators. Khan has repeatedly turned to the work of 20th-century photographers who have themselves explored the notion of the archive, including Bernd and Hilla Becher, a husband-and-wife team known for their decades-long project of documenting various industrial structures, such as water towers and blast furnaces. Khan's condensation of whole bodies of the Bechers' work into single images underscores its obsessive, serial nature. The resulting ghostly palimpsests also suggest a melancholy reminder of the passage of timeone which is especially suitable in this context, given that most of the industrial-era structures the Bechers catalogued were on the brink of extinction. This particular work was made shortly after Bernd Becher's death in 2007.\n",

I-Be Area (2007), a feature-length promenade through this universe, was written, directed, and edited by Trecartin, who also stars in no fewer than five roles alongside a troupe of friends and collaborators. The work's elusive narrative, which revolves around the clone I-Be II and such cohorts as Jamie, RAmada Omar, and ONxy-Tonyah, is filtered through a distinctive do-it-yourself aesthetic that incorporates ramshackle sets, brightly colored homemade costumes, cheap off-the-shelf video and sound effects, and rapidly edited, jargon-filled dialogue. Through these means Trecartin creates a striking new vision of queer culture in America, wittily updating the carnivalesque style of avant-garde filmmakers like Jack Smith and Kenneth Anger for the era of YouTube and Second Life. Unlike Smith and Anger, however, Trecartin draws his audiences further into his virtual reality through sculptural objects and installations built from his sets, including Jamie's Bedroom (2007), which is also in the collection of the Guggenheim Museum. Over time, it becomes apparent how thin the line separating Trecartin's world from our own truly is.Nat Trotman\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nPhoebe Washburn's installations explore generative systems based on absurd patterns of production. She typically combines countless numbers of cardboard boxes or pieces of scrap wood that she skims off the refuse of consumers and commerce, combing dumpsters and loading docks for basic matter. Her materials are discarded relics of daily routines, fatefully and incidentally discovered and transported to the studio where they are ordered and repurposed, imbuing with value what was once deemed worthless. Featuring already used, already worn, already consumed objects, which carry evidence of their own histories, she stacks, binds, and nails together her discoveries into installations that tell the story of their own making, consolidating by-products of their creation, such as sawdust and packing materials, into the final project.For its installation at Deutsche Guggenheim, Berlin, Washburn conceived of Regulated Fool's Milk Meadow as a self-contained factory that incorporated its own productgrass for the project's sod roofinto the installation over the course of the exhibition. For the first time, the artist integrated mechanics into her work, using a conveyor belt loop to shuttle small plots of soil through different stations for light and water, which nourished the growth of grass. These plots were periodically tended by a gardener who planted the seed, allowed it to germinate in a greenhouse before shifting the organic matter to the factory where it matured, and finally placed the output on the roof of the structure where it eventually atrophied and withered, removed from the sustaining system of water and light, thus exhibiting the full cycle of growth and decay.Washburn largely relies on improvisational and amateurish construction techniques. Here, the spontaneity of her architecture resonates with the natural development of the growing sod roof as well as its organic decline and decay. This practice stands in contrast with the characteristic efficiency intrinsic to the factory system. But Washburn often mines such apparently ridiculous juxtapositionshere, organic growth and mechanical toolsas loci of creativity.Joan Young\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nRiffs on Real Time is a three-part photographic series completed between 2002 and 2009, with each work comprising 10 color photographs. Hewitts production of the series follows a set compositional order: she takes discarded artifacts from American mass culture such as newspapers, magazines, books, manila envelopes, amateur snapshots, and other ephemera and repurposes them into visual assemblages. She then composes the objects into stacked arrangements and photographs each composition against the backdrop of hardwood floors or carpets commonly found in households. Hewitts intricate layering of these materials is a decidedly postmodern take on the still life.\nOften culled from vintage or used sources, the worn original images create a nostalgic overtone as well as refer to the passage of time. The foreground or first layeran image of a living room, a tourist snapshot of a vast outdoor landscape, or a candid shot of children playing in the backyardsuggests a personal iconography. The second layer evokes circulated material culture via an item like a map, schoolbook, magazine, or computer diagram. From protest literature to snapshots of marches and gatherings, archival material gathered from African American communities, particularly 1960s civil rights memorabilia, harkens back to Hewitts childhood and her parents involvement in the movement and can be found in either layer. The need for positive change and sense of urgency that grew from hard-won racial and sociopolitical struggles in the Unites States and contemporaneous African independence movements resonate in Hewitts work. The third layer is a background of flooring or carpet that reveals various dings, scrapes, or gouges resulting from everyday use. Within this third, seemingly domesticated layer, Hewitt allows the sense of myriad public and private selves to collide and converse. The individual images within each composition tell a story, but their juxtaposition complicates it by calling into question the relationship each image has with the others.\nThe title Riffs on Real Time is a play on the passage of time. In music, riffs are melodic and rhythmic improvisations, popularized through jazz. Similarly, Hewitt improvises within the medium of photography by shooting each varying composition and allowing for combinations and relationships to flourish among the three full series. Hewitt creates a story within a story, while crafting her own unique visual language. The multiple layers of textured items, color, and patterns become a metaphor for how memory, history, and common materials can be manipulated, transformed, restaged, and in turn powerfully shape the lens through which American culture and even art making is viewed.\nMiesha Shih\n",

His mixed media installations, which often utilize spotlights and kinetic mechanisms seem playful, but are actually uncanny, fearful, and ultimately disconcerting constructions. Mandal enhances each installation by balancing theatrical lights with deep shadows. Through chiaroscuro, the works take on narrative and performative elements, echoing the tradition of vernacular storytelling in India, where painted scrolls are brought to life with lamps at dusk. In Caged Sacks, nine steel cages are aligned to imitate prisoners' cells. Six contain jute gunnysacks used to transport sugar throughout the Indian subcontinent. By replacing the sugar with timed motors, the artist transforms these objects into writhing, potentially dangerous bodies (animal or human), which are kept at a remove behind steel bars, and succinctly conveys his deep sociopolitical concerns.

His practice initially developed through staged performances of lectures in near gibberish that undermine the rational rhetoric of post-Enlightenment thought. Though dense with social, political, and cultural references, these works elaborate an alternate reality without overarching, coherent meaning. Bock has since created cinematic films that dramatize the absurdities of life and the negotiation between the modern world and technological invention. Dandy (2006) is a surreal period drama about a fictional nineteenth-century inventors relationship with his servant, Louise, and his struggles with his own tortured genius. The spiraling narrative follows Monsieur Lautreamonts maddening search for aesthetic perfection through bizarre forays in poetry, fragrance, and even nature. The film was shot in the visually sumptuous Chateau du Bosc, the historic estate of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, the alcoholic aristocrat artist known for his vivid images of Belle Epoque Paris. Equally engrossing are the curious contraptions built by Lautreamont (played by the artist) and operated by Louise in the films frenzied, orgiastic finale.\n",

Though Disneys Pinocchio eventually finds a happy ending through moral redemption, Cattelans puppet is titled with a filial cry for approval or protection that has apparently gone unanswered. Pinocchio, the wooden toy who yearns to become a real boy, holds a special significance in Cattelans thematic repertoire, with its pervasive anxiety about the authenticity of his artistic status. Cattelans self-image is often at the center of his provocative work. Styling himself as the tragicomic court jester of contemporary art, he culminated this performative persona in an announced retirement following his 201112 Guggenheim retrospective. Bucking the linear tradition of the retrospective format, Cattelan suspended his works in the center of the rotunda, collapsing his oeuvre into a simultaneous narrative that summarized his career in one bold, broad stroke.\n",

For Merce Cunningham performs STILLNESS (2007), Dean constructs a whispered meditation on impermanence and nostalgia, casting the celebrated choreographer as performer of his 50-year partner and collaborator John Cage's avant-garde composition, 4'33\" (first performed 1952). Projected life-size on six screens, the six 16mm films record a nearly motionless Cunningham. Timed by a stopwatch, the choreographer assumes silent poses marking each of the score's three intentionally silent movements. The completion of Cage's work hinges on the sounds of the environment as the work's duration becomes a stage for chance. In Dean's conception of the piece, the absence of sound and Cunningham's stillness magnify the subtle flourishes of the choreographer's twitching eyelid and the ambient noises of the studio. Caught in a moment of hypnotic stasis, the films intimate an elegiac portrait of an aging artist and his deceased partner, articulating the melancholia of passing time.Lauren Hinkson\n",

Gonzales first became known for a group of canvases relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy that used found imagery to delve into the conspiracy theories surrounding the event and that hint at a sinister communal consciousness fostered by the networks of the World Wide Web. A similar, though more ambiguous, sense of the public sphere seems to haunt his recent paintings of crowds. Meticulously hand-painted from images found online, works like Waiting Crowd (2008) conjure a faceless populace that might simply be the passive audience of some spectacular event, but could just as easily be a riot-ready gathering of the disenfranchised masses. Cast in inky black, pale blue, or gray, these paintings exaggerate their relationship to photographic media; but as the viewer approaches each work, the images themselves unravel, revealing not a host of photographic details but a complex web of increasingly abstract brushstrokes. Gonzales leaves viewers to find their own meanings in the crowdapathy, danger, or perhaps the hope for positive social change. Nat Trotman\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMarclay is known for works that explore the relationship between sight and sound, often mining album covers or other found objects such as clothes or signs that use musical notes as a visual motif, for his collages, videos, and other works. In 2008, he was invited by the Graphicstudio at the University of South Florida to produce a limited-edition multiple, and he chose to make several unique cyanotypes, also known as blueprints, which are photograms made by placing objects onto light-sensitive paper. Among this group is Memento (Nirvana) (2008), a large-scale print in which cassette tape cascades from the top of the composition in several long, elegant strands. The verticality of the falling tape is balanced by catenaries of tape that drape from one end of the work to the other. From the parenthetical in the work's title, viewers could perhaps infer that the tape being used is of the 1990s grunge band, Nirvana, whose lead singer, Kurt Cobain, famously committed suicide in 1994. The word \"memento\" evokes the idea of a souvenir or keepsake that serves of a reminder of a past event. With this term, Marclay simultaneously addresses the history of a band and singer that no longer exist, and acknowledges the disappearance of the format used to record their music. From a formal standpoint, the abstract nature of the composition recalls paintings by Abstract Expressionist artists such as Jackson Pollock. In this sense, too, Memento (Nirvana) seems to pay tribute to a body of work, or style, that is in the past.\nClaire Barliant\n",

Drawing on the potent erotic charge of the high heel, Minter amplifies its currency as a fetishized sexual signifier by the liberal application of grime and watermaking it literally, as well as figuratively, dirty. In Dirty Heel (2008), there is a subtle shift in emphasis; the stiletto recedes from view in a haze of shimmering pastels while the besmirched foot is delineated with crisp verisimilitude. These shifting planes of focus are indicative of the photographic underpinnings of the artist's process, wherein she draws on multiple photographs as she builds up a composite image in luminous enamel paint. Here, the fleshy mass of the heel becomes an isolated anatomical fragment, a trope typical of the pornographic images appropriated by Minter in an earlier series of paintings. Unmoored from the body, scaled up, and intensely cropped, the forms are at first glance barely legible as a figurative image, hovering seductively on the brink of abstraction.Katherine Brinson\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nFounded by Anjalika Sagar and Kodwo Eshun, the Otolith Group produces multiform projects that elaborate on theoretical, conceptual, aural, and visual trajectories. Their research-based practice lends itself to curatorial and publishing experiments as much as it does to works in installation and film. Based in London, the groups work is characterized by a transnationality that defies the exclusionary strategies of global geopolitics while engaging with its problems and implications.\nIn Communists Like Us (200610), the group selects and sequences photographic images from two archives bequeathed by the educationalist Dr. Anasuya Gyan-Chand to her daughter Chitra Gyan-Chand, who in 2006 passed them on to Anjalika Sagar. Titled Daughter Products I and II, the archives consist of photographic documentation of encounters between politicians and activists in India with their counterparts in Japan, Maos China, and other Asian countries from the mid 1950s to the early 60s, as well as visits by delegations of female activists from India to the Soviet Union throughout the same period. The term daughter products is derived from atomic physics and is used here to allude to the generational aspect of radioactive decay. Communists Like Us interleaves a visual narrative composed from these images of socialist friendship with a textual narrative extracted from the subtitled conversation between revolutionary activist Francis Jeanson and Veronique, a Maoist student played by Anne Wiazemsky, in Jean Luc Godards 1967 film La Chinoise.\nIn the sequence selected from La Chinoise, which is set on a train, Veronique and Jeanson debate the efficacy of revolutionary violence. Jeansons side of the dialogue is assigned to the back of the archival photographs and Veroniques the front, while the nature of the conversation influences the display of the image, its absence, or its original annotation. The conjunction of conversation and photographic image is further framed by two musical sequences from Cornelius Cardew and the Scratch Orchestras The Great Learning (1969) and Ennio Morricones soundtrack to Dario Argentos film Il Gatto a nove code (The Cat O Nine Tails) (1971). The photographic archive attests to an intimate and extensive postwar exchange in Asia, which is contrasted with the generational debate over revolutionary desire in La Chinoise. Communists Like Us thus plots two interlinked orbits around questions of representation and manifestation. Titled after Communists Like Us: New Spaces Of Alliance, New Lines (1990), in which philosophers Felix Guattari and Antonio Negri discuss the political project of autonomy in the era prior to the collapse of communism, Communists Like Us began in 2006 as a performance at Huis a/d Werf in Utrecht, and exemplifies the experimental and enquiring nature of the Otolith Groups practice. \nJune Yap\n",

For Light bulb to Simulate Moon Light (2008), Paterson worked with engineers to take light-meter readings, analyze wavelengths, and finally locate an appropriate surface coating in order to produce a bulb that emits rays approximating the light of a full moon. Paterson commissioned Osram to manufacture 289 bulbs, each lasting 2,000 hours so that the total duration of the whole set corresponds to a lifetime, based on the average human life expectancy of 66 years as estimated in 2008. With each installation, during which the entire set is exhibited with a single bulb burning in the gallery, the lifespan of the artwork is shortened. In its poignant evocation of human mortality through physical objects and the stark deployment of contemporary technologies, the work asserts a sense of the sublime within human parameters.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAgathe Snow's work balances visions of apocalypse and entropic decay with an earnest faith in the redemptive power of human ingenuity and community. Her performances, ranging from carnivalesque banquets to her legendary dance marathons, operate as scenarios for uninhibited social exchange, always enacted with a fierce conceptual commitment. Performative elements and elaborate fictions also underpin Snow's sculptural installations, which she fashions from an exuberant array of debris scavenged from local streets. With the transformative addition of paint, plaster, and collage, she coaxes her found objects and their attendant histories into evocative new forms that frequently develop and mutate over the course of an exhibition. Demonstrating the artist's sustained fascination with mythic structures, Goldfinch is drawn from a body of work inspired by the fables of Leonardo da Vinci, in which she elucidates a relationship between Renaissance ideas and the modern paradigm of the American Dream. In this hanging mobile, painted papier-mache bunniesredolent of Jeff Koons's iconic 1986 sculpture Rabbitare combined with an inverted silhouette of a girl's profile, an old sweater, and kitschy religious icons in a moment of tense suspended animation that evokes a tangle of narrative associations.\nKatherine Brinson\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWolfgang Tillmans's expansive photographic practice eschews traditional classification, often blurring the boundaries between found and staged images. Most recently, Tillmans has extended this ambiguity to his abstract works, using pure light to create images from cameraless darkroom experiments. Recalling his ongoing series Impossible Color (1996present), made from photochemical accidents and unreproducible colors, the unique print Lighter 46 is an image of the photographic process itself. Here Tillmans retreats from the camera and photographic enlarger, choreographing the diaphanous washes of color using chemicals and homemade light sources on light-sensitive paper. The perceptible impermanence of these manipulations of light, their incarnations as emerald dust and a ghostly haze of crimson, are disrupted by a rigid fold that lifts the work into its Plexiglas enclosure, transforming it into a three-dimensional object. With this sculptural gesture, Tillmans constructs a tactile still life out of a transitory moment in the darkroom.\nLauren Hinkson\n",

The action was organized by the artist, whose voice-over expresses her hope that the rescued tree will in some way delay the construction that poses as progress but portends homogeneity.

    "description": "\nDescription\n...And Europe Will Be Stunned (200711) centers on a young Polish politicians call for the return of 3.3 million Jewish emigrants to their ancestral homeland. A contemporary riff on Leni Riefenstahls Nazi propaganda films, this trilogy drifts among the idioms of documentary, biopic, and art-house drama, in a story that folds fiction with events past and present. The series opens with Mary Koszmary (Nightmares) set in the ruins of Warsaws Stadion Dziesieciolecia (Decennial Stadium), where politician Sawomir Sierakowski issues a cry to the vacant fields, summoning the return of the Jewish people to Poland. In the second film, Mur I Wieza (Wall and Tower), the politicians idealistic followers, members of the Jewish Renaissance Movement in Poland (JRMiP), heed his behest; at the site of the former Warsaw Ghetto, they build a tower-and-stockade-style kibbutz, a settlement method developed by Zionists in the British Mandate of Palestine during the 193639 Arab Revolt. Intended for external protection as well as internal control, the barbed wirewrapped wall and tower evokes the feeling of captivity to those within and impenetrability to outsiders. The concluding film, Zamach (Assasination), presents the assassination of Sierakowskis character by an unknown assailant, a tragedy that, as seen through his followers words of eulogy, solidifies the imagined JRMiP. Borrowing from symbols of Polands and Israels past, Bartana reconfigures their context, raising issues of displacement and assimilation. Braiding the real with the fictive, ...And Europe Will Be Stunned proposes alternate ideas and narratives in order to reconsider pre-constructed, accepted conclusions.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWalter Benjamins A Chinoiserie Out of the Old West, a 1928 article for the German magazine Die Literarische Welt in which he recounts his meeting with the American movie star Anna May Wong, is the basis for Patty Changs two-channel video installation The Product Love (Die Ware Liebe) (2009). The installations first video features two women (one of whom is Asian) and a man struggling to translate Benjamins article into English. As they stumble through the text, their stilted translation suggests a sense of awe on the part of the writer: Benjamin reports that Wong loves tragic scenes and combs her hair in the style of a dragon playing in water. He asks Wong what means of expression she would turn to if film were no longer available. Wong answers, according to the original German text, touch woulda misspelling that suggests unfamiliarity with the expression touch wood. To reinforce the linguistic gap, one of the translators interprets the homophonous phrase literally, explaining that Wong means that she would turn to touch as an alternative to film. This amusing mise en abyme of misunderstandings leads into the second video, which is projected onto a different screen after the first one ends. The opening scene takes place in a Chinese beauty parlor in which two Chinese actors are being made up to look like Benjamin and Wong. Chang again highlights the unintentional errors that occur during translation. A director speaking in Mandarin is translated as saying that for Benjamin, Wong represented Chinese culture, and that he just want to flirt or want to touch the parts of the womans body that make May Wong feel good. . . . How to call that in English? G-point. G-spot. The remainder of the film is a soft-core porn scene between the two actors, who seem uncomfortable in their roles, and their discomfort reinforces not only the temporal gulf between 1928 and 2009, but also the cultural differences between Benjamin and Wong.

    "description": "\nDescription\nA Palestinian-Kuwaiti who has never been to his Palestinian homeland, Tarek Al-Ghoussein situates himself as a protagonist struggling with his surroundings in his series Self Portrait (200203), A Series (200304), B Series (200506), C Series (2007), and D Series (2008), as well as his recent projects D2 Series (2009) and E Series (2010). Intentionally borrowing from the Greek myth of Sisyphus, a figure condemned to repeatedly and eternally pushing a boulder up a mountain, the artist alludes to the mythical character's frustratingly cyclical existence and the underlying need for a call to revolt that he inspires. By extension, the figure of the Palestinian, whose news-media depiction during the Palestinian Intifada often included images of protests and rock throwing, is caught in a similar uphill battle, struggling for revolution. The fraught layers of resistance, longing, and belonging are reflected in the figure's physical and psychological relation to the landscape and environment. The land becomes the self-portrait of a complicated identity and history.\nAl-Ghoussein is influenced by the New Topographic movement in photography, led by Robert Adams and Frank Gohlke, and he experiments with the idea of the staging and theatricality of nothingness. As a way of negotiating identity in his photographic series, Al-Ghoussein draws out this \"nothing\" with landforms and physical obstacles, situating the figure as an interruption in the overall composition. The A Series and B Series feature the artist in different locations, approaching or standing near some sort of barriera construction inspired in part by the erection of the West Bank Wall. With the C Series, the artist introduced a blue tarp that stands in for the illusive home or shelter. Al-Ghoussein shows himself dragging the tarp or covered by it in almost tentlike formations. It becomes the dominant element in the composition, with the figure barely present as the artist is subsumed by the vastness of his surroundings. These series address the impermanence and transience of a nomadic, diasporic lifethe displacement and isolation of the figure in the landscape suggesting the individual's personal Sisyphean struggle to understand his or her relationship to the environment and world.\nIn Untitled 5 (from D Series, 2008), the tarp is gone; only the head and shoulders of the figure are visible, and he appears to be standing in a trench. Piles of sand next to the hole suggest that it was recently dug. Through an open gate and beyond two sets of walls, the utility poles and treetops of a city or village are visible. Despite the call of what lies ahead, the figure remains immobile, submerged in the landscape, his gaze imperceptible to the viewer. In Untitled 5, the figure has been mapped and displaced, fixed in place in the trench. This photograph, as well as others in the series, are mournful meditations on the barriers, both physical and abstract, that prevent the artist from returning to his homeland.\nReem Fadda\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nFrom a distance, Impenetrable appears to be an ethereal cube levitating in the gallery. When approached, the work reveals a menacing aspect: the cube is composed of hundreds of barbed wire rods dangling from fishing wire. Like many of Mona Hatoums installations since the early 1990s, Impenetrable takes the form of a grid. Yet the austere geometric form, which recalls Minimalist sculpture, also harbors a psychological charge. The steel latticework appears to be as delicate as it is threatening, and the barbed wire evokes architectural formsfences, prisons, campsdesigned both to confine and repel. Such images are evocative of conflict, violence, and state authority, and Hatoums work is often discussed in relation to her own experience as a Palestinian exile. Still, the artist herself suggests that the significance of her work extends beyond biographical references: I find it more exciting when a work reverberates with several meanings and paradoxes and contradictions.1The human body remains an axial thread throughout Hatoums artistic practice, though the late 80s marked a departure from the usage of her own body to the construction of phenomenological situations for the viewer, as in Impenetrable. In a turn of dark humor not uncommon in Hatoums work, the title refers directly to the often brilliantly colored, monochromatic cubes of Venezuelan kinetic artist Jesus Rafael Sotos Penetrables (196797) that are composed of masses of hanging plastic cords into which spectators are welcome to enter. In contrast to Sotos exuberant blurring of the static and dynamic, the interior and exterior, Hatoum erects an impasse, a cube of space partitioned by wire, which spectators may view but never penetrate.\nLauren Hinkson \n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn the Near Future began in 2005 as a performance piece jointly presented by Performa 05 and Art in General, New York. Hayes stood in nine locations throughout New York for nine consecutive days holding different protest signs. Many of these signs dated from earlier eras, though continue to be relevant today: on Wall Street, for example, Hayes carried the sign \"Ratify E.R.A. Now!,\" referring to the women's Equal Rights Amendment, which was introduced in 1923, fought for fiercely by feminists during the 1970s, and has yet to be ratified. Other slogans included \"Strike Today,\" \"Actions Speak Louder than Words,\" and \"Nothing Will Be as Before,\" which the artist held in front of City Hall. In what might be one of the most provocative gestures from this work, Hayes held a sign bearing the famous phrase, \"I Am a Man.\" Although the words come from the 1968 Memphis sanitation strike by African-American workers protesting racial discrimination in the workplace, they take on an entirely different meaning when held by a white woman. She later went on to conduct similar performances in Brussels, London, Paris, Vienna, and Warsaw, using signs written in the language native to the country in which the performance was taking place. While executing these performances, or \"actions,\" to use the term preferred by the artist, Hayes invited the audience to document the project. The result is 354 images of Hayes carrying signs on different streets all over the world. This documentation was shot on slides, which make up the installation component of the work. The images from each action are projected on a loop, each on its own slide projector. All of the projections occur simultaneously, allowing the viewer to infer connections among the different slogans.\nHayes has recited, or, to use her chosen term, \"re-spoken\" speeches from the past, including Patty Hearst's taped messages to her parents when she was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army in 1974 and Ronald Reagan's presidential addresses to the nation. For Hayes, the photographs of the actions that make up In the Near Future constitute a new way of thinking about revisiting past political acts or speeches. In an interview, Hayes compared the photographs to Robert Smithson's notion of \"site\" versus \"non-site,\" saying that she views documentation such as photographs, videos, or audio files that capture a politically charged moment as \"not-events\": \"If a photograph or a film or a video or a sound clip lives or carries on into the future, it is usually because it is something other than just a document. It usually has some event-like status of its own. This 'not-event, like Robert Smithson's site and non-site, has a relationship to the event that can never be severed.\"1\nBy considering the documentation, or framing, of political events, Hayes also takes into account the documentation of her performances and undertakes to actively choreograph their recording for posterity. This accounting for future audiences is fundamental to the complex temporal engagement of Hayes's entire oeuvre thus far, which addresses not only pivotal moments in the past, but also how they are viewed in the present, and how they will be presented in the future.\nClaire Barliant\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\n1392 Moon Jars (Wind) (200810), is a large-scale installation that embodies seemingly disparate, even oppositional ideas, such as totality and individuality, irregularity and order, and singularity and conformity. It is composed of more than a thousand ceramic jars, each about 8 cm tall, which are arranged on the floor in concentric circles, making up a large circle just over 400 cm in diameter. The original moon jar was made during the Chosun Dynasty (13921910), and is so named for its milky glaze and \"full moon\" shape. The jars in Kang's work were hand thrown and fired in a Korean kiln that is known for making moon jars. Each vessel is deliberately imperfect, revealing the touch of its maker, and is formed from two parts of clay, the bottom half and the top. The two semi-spheres are connected by hand, often resulting in a visible joint mark near the middle and slight irregularities in the overall form. Thus each jar is different, although when viewed together with the other jars in the installation, it becomes one component of a larger whole.\nThe tension between wholeness and separation is integral to the work's meaning, since 1392 Moon Jars (Wind) is informed by spiritual and political concerns. The work's mysterious nature is enhanced by its phenomenological impact: When viewers speak to one another across the installation, the jars cause the sound of their voices to vibrate and amplify, and the natural force of the wind becomes linked to breath. The two halves of each jar also serve as a metaphor for Korea, which was forced to divide into two countries after World War II, when the Soviet Union and the United States assumed control of the country but backed different leaders, resulting in the formation of two different states. Throughout Ik-Joong Kang's oeuvre, the jar functions as an eloquent articulation of his desire for the reunification of Korea. About a similar piece, entitled Moon Jar (2006), which Kang made for the Korean Mission to the United Nations, he wrote: \"It becomes one body and it starts breathing air into the sky. The Moon Jar exemplifies oneness from this connection.\"1 Indeed, although the jars are empty, the parenthetical in the title, \"wind,\" suggests that viewers should think of them as holding immaterial and elusive concepts, such as time, memory, dreams, and hope, namely the hope that a divided country will one day be unified.\nClaire Barliant\n1.

Whether photography, video, or sculpture, his projects typically focus on communication, investigating the ways that image and text influence and transform social relationships. Keegans pieces frequently rely on appropriation, as seen in his 2009 work AMERICAMERICA excerpt #1 and excerpt #2. As part of a project for which he traveled the route of the 1986 Hands Across America campaign against homelessness, in this sculpture Keegan reproduced historical images from the movement along with newspaper clippings, copies of artworks, and popular media images of the time. Juxtaposing these materials, the work unpacks both the personal and historical implications of the mid-1980s political moment, reaching beyond the issue of homelessness to consider the AIDS crisis, sexuality, real estate, feminism, and corporate greed. Bringing these documents to bear on the current political and social climate, Keegan asks, How did we get here? and perhaps more importantly, How do we move forward?\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nActive in Korea, Japan, and France since the 1960s, Lee Ufan has been creating a visual, conceptual, and theoretical terrain that has radically expanded the possibilities for Post-Minimalist painting and sculpture. Lee's innovative body of work revolves around the notion of encounterseeing the bare existence of what is actually before us and focusing on \"the world as it is.\"\nBorn in Korea in 1936, Lee studied painting at the College of Fine Arts at Seoul National University and philosophy at Nihon University in Tokyo. He rose to prominence in the late 1960s as the leading theorist and practitioner of Mono-ha (School of Things), a Japanese art movement that developed from the collapse of colonial world orders, antiauthoritarian protests, and the rise of modernity critiques. Lee's sculptures, presenting dispersed arrangements of stones together with industrial materials like steel plates, rubber sheets, and glass panes, recast the discrete object as a network of relations based on parity between the viewer, materials, and site. Lee was also a pivotal figure in the Korean tansaekhwa (monochrome painting) school, which offered a fresh approach to minimalist abstraction by presenting repetitive gestural marks as bodily records of time's perpetual passage. Lee has coupled his artistic practice with a prodigious body of critical and philosophical writings.\nFor Lee, restraint in creating arteven letting what has been created disappearshifts the status of his works from that of material objects to fleeting lived experiences, and his nonproduction emerges as a nuanced critique of the Western societal prevalence of surplus and overproduction. Relatum, the title of all Lee's sculptures, is a philosophical term denoting things or events between which a relation exists. This radical approach to the artwork, not as an object but as a network of relationships, shifts artistic experience to an act of encounter, an occasion that unfolds around the viewer in a particular time and space. Since his early Mono-ha period, Lee has restricted his choice of materials to steel plates and stones, focusing on their precise conceptual and spatial juxtaposition. The steel platehard, heavy, solidis used to build things in the modern world; the stone, in its natural, as-is state, \"belongs to an unknown world,\" as the artist puts it, beyond the self and outside modernity, evoking the Other or \"externality.\"\nConsisting of two steel rods and two small stones, Relatumdissonance (2009/11) illustrates how, through a subtle shift in positioning (the stone and rod touch in one instance and lay separate in another), the dynamic of the composition changes by creating a situation of mutual interdependence on the one hand and detached coexistence on the other.\nAlexandra Munroe\n",

A hybrid of painting and photography, Saunders created this particular work by painting with oil paint and silver ink on both sides of Mylar sheets that were then used as a negative to produce a unique contact-print photograph. The process resulted in an image that preserves the scale of the original painting, while inverting the tonality and conflating the multiple layers of the varied materials involved. In this instance, the tape that Saunders used to mask the painting becomes an integral element of the composition and provides evidence of the tools of its making. The final image, suggestive of damaged celluloid, is imbued with a nostalgia that resonates with its subject of a near-forgotten screen star.Joan Young\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAlexandre Singh's Assembly Instructions (2008 ) series consists of photocopy collages mounted on a wall and connected by dotted lines drawn by hand in graphite. These diagrammatic compositions are exemplary of Singh's practice, which is largely motivated by locating unexpected connections between disparate events, people, or places. Assembly Instructions (An Immodern Romanticism) (2009) is composed of 27 neatly framed black-and-white photocopy collages made from images sourced from websites such as Flickr and Wikipedia. The collages are installed on the wall in columns that stem from a collage placed just below them, at the center. At first glance, the diagram appears to be driven by logic, illustrating a causal relationship between the images. In fact, its pseudo-museological appearance is a whimsical investigation of the characters Meredith Grey and Carrie Bradshaw, the protagonists of the television series Grey's Anatomy and Sex and the City. The central collage consists of a 19th-century etching of a hand holding, anachronistically, a television remote control. From there, a chain of loose associations draws parallels between 19th-century Romanticism and the 21st-century TV sitcom romantic heroines. Singh makes a thought-provoking and amusing case for a comparison between the cliche-ridden characters of Grey and Bradshaw, and the Byronic antihero, who is deeply troubled yet highly charismatic. Two collages represent this collision: Grey's image is superimposed over that of Lord Byron, while Bradshaw's is superimposed over Alexander Pushkin, creating two convincing characters of indeterminate gender and time period. As amusing as this juxtaposition is, it is also a serious examination of the creative process, utilizing a hypertextual approach to illustrate a sort of mental version of the game Chutes and Ladders, replete with connective conduits from one point, or idea, to another. Ultimately, Singh's meta-technique always points to the structure of the work itself and its deliberately nonlinear trajectory.\nClaire Barliant\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe history of American presence in Cambodia is the subject of Vandy Rattanas Bomb Ponds (2009), a video and series of photographs that looks at the lasting effects of U.S. bombing operations on the nations landscape, its people, and their collective memory. Bomb Ponds has its origins in the production of another series of photographs by the artist, Walking Through (2009), which pictures Cambodian rubber plantations introduced during French colonization. While developing this sequence, the artist chanced upon what locals called a bomb pond, a body of water within a man-made crater. Curious, he searched for and photographed similarly ravaged sites, drawn to their paradoxically idyllic, overgrown settings.\nThe craters in Bomb Ponds are the results of 2,756,941 tons of bombs dropped by U.S. forces during the Vietnam War between 1964 and 1973, a figure that was publicly acknowledged only in 2000. It is debatable whether the military operation in Cambodia contributed to the rise of the Khmer Rouge, its aggression fueling the resistance or, despite the loss of life and livelihood, aided the Cambodian people. Either way, the assault also points to the various interventions that Cambodians have faced throughout history, of Thai (Siam), French, Japanese, Vietnamese, and American origin. These interventions were variously administrative, ideological, and territorial, and were, as the artist emphasizes, often more complex than official histories suggest. \nVandys practice recalls that of Cambodian artists such as Svay Ken, whose paintings note both the ordinary and the unexpected. In a country where photography plays a critical documentary rolein images of the Khmer Rouges S-21 interrogation center Tuol Sleng, for example, or the memorialization of Khmer Rouge violence housed in the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, Bomb Ponds stands as witness to a continuing struggle against Cambodian historical revisionism. In the works video component, one villager relates the experience of hiding her family underground at the sound of incoming planes, while another is too aggrieved to discuss the memories that the sight of the ponds evokes. By thus underscoring the enduring damage wrought by military operations, Bomb Ponds suggests that this history deserves as much acknowledgement as the effects of the Khmer Rouge or the celebration of the Hindu-then-Buddhist temple complex of Angkor Wat. The ponds tragic aspect contrasts with national rebuilding projects such as the filling of Beoung Kok Lake for urban redevelopment featured in another work by the artist, an undertaking that poses a different kind of threat to the local community.\nJune Yap\n",

Written in French, the letter was mailed to the Guggenheim by the artists father and archived in a ledger; although multiple copies of the transcribed letter exist, the total number will remain undefined until Phung Vos death. 2.02.1861 complicates traditional notions of authorship and demonstrates the centrality of familial relationships within Danh Vos work, especially the father-son relationship that is presented here as a tragic historical archetype. \nLauren Hinkson \n",

(2009), Sharif Waked adopts the format of perhaps the most jarring and politically significant personal videos to emerge in recent years, in which radical Muslim terrorists recite their last will and testament in preparation for a suicide bombing. Here, however, this grisly conclusion is endlessly deferred by a simple substitution: rather than reciting his will, the protagonist, played by the Palestinian actor Saleh Bakri, reads a lengthy excerpt from One Thousand and One Nights. The text, one of the most important in Arabic literature, tells the story of the queen Scheherazade, who spends each night recounting fantastic tales to her husband, who has promised to execute her the following morning. By breaking off her stories at dawn, the queen prolongs her life one day at a time until, after one thousand days, the king decides to spare her. By staging this text within a setting of contemporary political discord, Waked interrupts the discourse around terrorism with a continuous stream of poetic language, while confounding Western audiences expectations of masculinity in the Islamic Middle East. At the same time, the stories he tells through the words of Scheherazade offer a glimpse of the deep historical underpinnings of Arabic identity today, in all its dynamism and complexity.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMultidisciplinary artist Aung Myint is one of the pioneers of modern art in Myanmar (previously known as Burma). The self-taught artist has embraced diverse aesthetic practices, from both nonrepresentational and figurative painting to performance art and installation. In his series Mother and Child (2002 ), Aung Myint images the concepts of nature and nurture in a few simple but effective brushstrokes. However, it is the works distinct conceptual underpinning that distinguishes the artists practice from more romanticized visions of Burmese culture and history. From these multiple images of the maternal figure clasping a childrendered in an unmistakable yet still ambiguous linea variety of meanings emerge. The series may be read as combining the positive and negative attributes of patriotism, for example, reflecting on the protection it can offer while criticizing its tendency to constrain and limit. Marking a lively trail that twists and turns across the artists preferred shan (mulberry) paper, these shapes resemble the traditional Burmese alphabet but are not quite the language itself, thus suggesting both articulation and reticence.\nAung Myints painting White Stupa Doesnt Need Gold (2010) is similarly agile. In much of Southeast Asia, few traces of the regions ancient kingdoms remain. But in Myanmar, pagodas built by the early civilizations of the kingdom of Pagan (8491297), and in periods of prosperity that came after it, stand as prominent and powerful monuments to a cultural and aesthetic history that continues to shape national identity. In the painting, the artist begins with the form of a typical Buddhist pagoda (easily recognized by its gilded bell-shaped dome, examples of which dot the Myanmarian landscape). But the artist disrupts the expected representation by depicting the structure unembellished against an enigmatic inky-black background. Scattered casually across the dark expanse are squares of gold leaf that recall the opulence of the historic parabeik, concertina-style books illustrated with royal or religious scenes. Unlike the gilded pagodastourist attractions and objects of cultural pridethe gold in Aung Myints painting seems to have become detached and inessential, leaving the dome to radiate even while unadorned. Seeming to critique the privileging of appearance over substance, and acting as a prompt to introspection, the artists measured observationrooted as it is in the cultures and histories of a country undergoing political and social reformalso speaks to the inevitability of change, as evidenced in the passage of empires.\nJune Yap\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMalaysian artist Wong Hoy Cheongs practice often engages with historical, political, and social influence. Beginning with local specificities, his works commentaries reach beyond their immediate contexts. Colonization has had a broad influence on Malaysian experience, and this impact is explored by Wong in works such as Buckingham Street and its Vicinity (2002) and Downing Street and its Vicinity (2002). In these two lithographs, the artist merges and partially fictionalizes maps of London and Penang, his home state in Malaysia. The overlapping sites and place names narrate the artists sense of dislocation on his first significant visit to the territory of Malayas colonizers, and the lasting imprint of colonial life on the landscape of present-day Malaysia. His video installation Re:Looking (2002) also reorients the relationship of colonizer to colonized, depicted in a television program about a fictional postcolonial Austrian experience following the artists imagined Malaysian colonization of Austria (16831995). Yet such works are not mere critiques of colonialism; rather, they reflect on the human capacity for social and cultural adaptation and flexibility in response to cultural and political confrontation.\nWongs Doghole (2010) is a nuanced exploration of the occupation of pre-independent Malaysia by the Japanese during and following World War II. It originates from his 1990 installation of painting, performance, and film Sook Ching (cleansing or purge). This analyzes the titular 1942 massacre through stories of terror and trauma related by survivors, and by the families of young Chinese who were detained by the Kempeitai (Imperial Japanese Army). Doghole portrays the same historical event but concentrates on the single account of Wong Kum Peng, one of very few survivors of the detention cells. In this video, the artist delves deeper into the psychological effects of war, suggesting that its conditions of great stress and uncertainty tend to elicit equally extreme and ambiguous responses, including fantasies of escape and complicity, as well as unexpected acts of empathy and compassion. Wongs use of contemporary animation techniques lends the works reenactment of historical events a vivid quality that seems initially at odds with its grim subject matter. Yet in so doing, he extends its relevance beyond the history of a single event, relating it to comparable incidents of detention throughout the world. The video never makes clear why Wong Kum Peng was imprisoned, nor why he was allowed to survive, but does suggest that even tragic histories can incorporate alternative, hopeful narratives. Doghole is Wongs attempt to produce, in his word, a beautiful film about violence; his eschewing of a naturalistic approach in favor of giving a horrific subject aesthetic appeal ultimately accentuates the exceptional nature of war.\nJune Yap  \n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nBangladesh was partitioned in 1947 from India and again in 1971 from Pakistan, making it one of the youngest nations in South and Southeast Asia. The wars that resulted in its independence, and the unsettled aftermath thereof, ruptured not only the land and the lives of its people, but also the history and representation of the nation. In a context of conflicting and contested historical accounts, and in the face of ongoing scarcity of resources and development, artists including Tayeba Begum Lipi attempt to formulate aesthetic responses. In 2002, having studied drawing and painting at the University of Dhaka, the artist cofounded the Britto International Artists Workshop with her partner, artist Mahbubur Rahman. Later established as Britto Arts Trust, and augmented by the communal Britto Space in Dhaka, the organization extended its reach beyond Bangladesh through exhibitions, residencies, talks, collaborations, and exchanges. \nFor the artist, the nations political state forms the backdrop to another critical political concern: the gendered violence that was rife during both partitions. Her works reflect on both the double bind of the personal and the political, expressing and accentuating a sense of unease through a public form of gendered expression that also speaks to challenges faced by the artist and her contemporaries. In Bizarre and Beautiful (2011), exhibited at the inaugural Bangladesh Pavilion at the 54th Venice Biennale, she transformed mock stainless-steel razor blades into the fabric of a feminine undergarment. Attractive yet threatening, the article is converted into a hard, gritty form, possessing the qualities of armor or a shield.\nRazor blades return in Love Bed (2012), in which the shared space of domesticity, affection, and bliss glints with both threat and invitation. The blade here represents not merely the violence implied by its sharp edge, but also the objects function as a basic tool to aid in childbirth in the absence of other medical support, a circumstance that the artist recalls from childhood. Printed on the blades is the Bengali name Balaka, a well-known Bangladeshi brand. Coming from a large family, the artist associates the strength of steel with the tenacity of the women who surrounded her as she grew up, individuals who defied the odds to keep their families and communities together. Yet these works resist interpretation according to simple binary opposition along historical, religious, social, or gendered lines. As much as the skeins of razors draped across the bed frame warn against our approach, they also, paradoxically, join together into a productive space for connection and dialogue. \nJune Yap\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nIn Tuan Andrew Nguyens Enemys Enemy: Monument to a Monument (2012), a classic American Louisville Slugger baseball bat is transformed into a meditation on the unifying and divisive powers of religion and sport. The figure carved into the bat is a memorial to Thich Quang uc, a highly venerated Buddhist monk who in 1963 performed self-immolation in protest against the repression of the Buddhist community by Ngo inh Diems South Vietnamese government. An official bias toward Roman Catholicism, a remnant of the regions French colonization, led, in the post-Cochinchina period after 1954, to religious inequality, prompting Thich Quang ucs demonstration. The selfless act was widely televised, and formed part of the mounting pressure on the Diem government that led to its deposition later in the year. Popular sports such as baseball can also stir community loyalties, uniting and dividing groups as do organized religions. Enemys Enemy illustrates the contradiction embodied by the two phenomena, their shared power to both engender solidarity and instigate conflict. In addition, the commemorative monument, installed in a reunited Vietnam, appears highly incongruous given the communist state ideologys antipathy toward religion. \nLayered over the works reference to a specific moment in Vietnamese history is an allusion to the Vietnam War as a whole, and to the U.S. support that the South Vietnamese received during that conflict. The patented bat is manufactured by Hillerich &amp; Bradsby, a company that in the 1940s produced rifle stocks for the U.S. army as part of the war effort. Given this history, and through the image of the flames eating through the bats critical section, a sense of violence pervades the work. Yet the figure of the bodhisattvaa name bestowed in acknowledgement of Thich Quang ucs enlightened statusemanates serenity and acquiescence (the monks self-sacrifice was performed in silence). In a similar fashion, Nguyens earlier work Take Cover Take Care (2008) juxtaposes lyrics by American rapper Tupac Shakur and Vietnamese rapper Wowy carved into the undersides of two manhole covers. In spite of their common genre and subcultural contexts, the two sets of lyrics express markedly contrasting sentiments, the former responding to cultural and social control with the threat of violence, and the latter with a patient acceptance of difference.\nIn Enemys Enemy, the historical Vietnamese craft of woodcarving is brought to contemporary life. This skill, used in architectural detailing and figurative representation, was promoted by the last Vietnamese dynasty, the lineage of Nguyen (18021945). In Enemys Enemy the cultural exchange is reciprocated in a commemorative transformation of the American Northern White Ash baseball bat. Thus the work demonstrates the artists aptitude for marrying seemingly disparate subjects and materials, reflecting diverse cultural influences from East and West, and incorporating popular-cultural elements. \nJune Yap\n",

It also amplifies the artists subtle practice of subjecting the world to personal, idiosyncratic systems. The work, which was created as part of a commission for the Deutsche Guggenheim, Berlin, comprises a collection of small particles and miniscule forms of debris left behind by athletes and spectators in the Astroturf of a playing field on Pier 40 in New York. Orozco displays these myriad itemsnumbering nearly 1,200 and including coins, sneaker logos, bits of soccer balls, candy wrappers, wads of chewing gum, and tangles of threadby subjecting them to a taxonomic arrangement, organized by material, color, and size, among other criteria. The objects are accompanied by twelve grids of images of the individual artifacts, printed at larger-than-life size, again organized typologically to create a kind of visual ricochet between an individual item and its photographic representation. A thirteenth grid, exhibited here, documents the landscape from which the objects were retrieved.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAraya Rasdjarmrearnsook achieved international prominence with an earlier project, Conversations with Death on Lifes First Street (2005), a series of videos in which the artist addresses rooms filled with corpses on the experience and meaning of death. The existential paradox of death in life is represented seamlessly in these stark encounters, which for the artist are not simply about the end of life but explore the state of being between the beginning (birth) and the end (death). In The Treachery of the Moon (2012), this twinning of opposite but related moments is emblematized as the visual intersection of two different worlds, the fictional realm of television drama and the reality of political clashes in 21st-century Thailand. The process of comparing excerpts from popular programs to scenes from the politically motivated violence that has split the nation into factions reveals similar desires and conflicts, and a blurring of the imaginary into the real. \nAccompanying the swirl of images that overwhelm the central figures of the artist and her dogs are songs from a more tranquil past, which evoke a nostalgia for simpler and more ethical times. With its evocative title, The Treachery of the Moon articulates Rasdjarmrearnsooks interest in the possibility of exposing consciousness and memory as dreamlike illusions. The introduction of the figure of the common dog into the artists works begins with Afterwards, regret rises in our memory even for bygone hardships (2009), and In reinterpreting old landscape we may have to endure repetitions of the same old karma (2009). In an empathetic commentary on karma, both works feature a domesticated creature whose well-being depends on human kindness. \nJune Yap\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nNorberto Roldans work offers a commentary on the social, political, and cultural conditions of the Philippines via simple but apposite assemblages of object, text, and image. In F-16 (2012), Roldan explores the subject of power negotiation in geopolitical encounters by drawing a relationship between the colonization of the Philippines and events on todays global stage. Excerpting from an interview published in the early 20th century with William McKinley, the 25th President of the United States, who victoriously led the benevolent assimilation of the Philippines in the Spanish-American War of 1898, the textual half of the diptych quotes the then-President on the reasons for occupation. According to McKinley, the Filipino people are unfit for self-government and they will soon have anarchy and misrule there worse than Spains wars; [...] there was nothing left for us to do but take them all; and to educate them and uplift and civilize and Christianize them.\nSubsequent tensions between the Filipino people and American forces would lead to their ouster of U.S. military presence, and to the independence of the Philippines in 1898. Juxtaposed with McKinleys utterance is an image of an American fighter jet cruising over Afghanistan post-9/11, a reference to Operation Enduring Freedom. In this diptych, the artist presents an open-ended dilemma that reflects not only the two historical events, but also, in relating them, points to the effects of domination and force, specifically their tendency to beget other such interventions and conflicts and thereby perpetuate a cycle of retaliation and vengeance. The juxtaposition of the two events, separated by a century, reveals a critique of human folly as destined to repeat its mistakes.\nCofounder, in 1986, of Black Artists in Asia, a group formed to observe political, social, economic, and cultural issues through aesthetic practice, Roldan is also one of the founders of Manila gallery Green Papaya Art Projects. While the artists painterly approach in F-16 appears to diverge from his earlier assemblages, it entails a similarly intimate transformation of historical reference in its reproduction of found elements. The earlier works bind contrary elements togetherone series juxtaposes the sacred and profane by pairing found objects with Roman liturgical vestmentswhile the monochromatic palette of F-16 renders image and text parallel in a way that questions the status of both. Yet Roldans introspective works, which display the formal influence of Joseph Cornell and Filipino artist Santiago Bose, transcend the specificities of Filipino history and politics to suggest an intimate connection with the wider world. \nJune Yap\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nArin Dwihartanto Sunaryos Volcanic Ash Series #4 (2012) appears entirely painterly, but was in fact made using a combination of resin and, as pigment, volcanic ash from the 2010 eruption of Gunung Merapi, the most active volcano in Indonesia. (This disaster claimed more than 100 lives and left a deep impression on the artist.) The use of these materials results in vivid gradients of natural color. Arins curiosity about the fluid character of paint, and his attempts to create a flowing effect, began while he was working in oils in 2005. First experimenting with applying resin to canvas, he eventually began using the resin-and-pigment mixture on its own, allowing the mixture to determine its own form by splashing it on glass. From this point on, the artist took up new tools and altered his format from a vertical to a horizontal plane. Sunrayo&amp;rquo;s visualization and technique also changed, as he began to paint starting with the immediate surface of the image, gradually working back to its base.\nThe relationship between aesthetic expression and political engagement in Indonesia is intimate and influential. In the narrative of Indonesian arts development during the decades of struggle that led to independence in 1945, and in the years that followed, art and artists have played a significant role in direct political engagement and social and political critique. They have often organized themselves into groups such as the Polemik Kebudayaan (193536) and LEKRA (Lembaga Kebudayaan Rakyat, or Peoples Cultural Institute/Organisation of Artists (1950c.1965). Beginning in the 70s, collectives that combined the aesthetic with the political, such as the Gerakan Seni Rupa Baru  or Indonesian New Art Movement (19751979) and Komunitas Utan Kayu (c.1994 ), continued this commitment to political movement, remaining active right up to Reformasi (reformation) in 1997, which saw the deposition of the then-incumbent President Suharto. Where art and politics converged, aesthetic expression tended toward the representational, the figure of the people occupying a central position.   With the ubiquity of figuration in the early 90s, the Minangkabau (West Sumatra) collective Kelompok Seni Rupa Jendela (KSRJ, or Jendela Art Group, 1993 ), elicited criticism for work that appeared at first politically noncommittal in its apparent focus on the manipulation of objects, shapes, and colors. However, KSRJs aesthetics succeeded in opening up dialogue around a less self-evident form of politics in contemporary practice, one in which Arins practice since 2005 has also been involved. In Volcanic Ash Series #4, the traces of historical event and social circumstance are preserved in the resin, which thus embodies both the land and its politicsincluding a politics of artin palpable form.\nJune Yap\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nTang Da Wu is credited as the founder of the Artists Village, a collective that has since its inception in 1988 become synonymous with experimental art in Singapore. Tangs practice, which spans painting, drawing, sculpture, installation, and performance art, is notable for its subtly poetic deconstruction of historical and cultural conditions. His three-part sculpture Our Children (2012) references a story from Teochew opera (a variant of the form distinct to the southern Chinese region from which the artists family hails), in which a young boy experiences illumination at the humbling sight of a baby goat genuflecting while suckling at its mother. This image is intended as a parable of the timeless virtues of respect and filial piety, and of the importance of cultural values.   \nIn Tangs stylized tableau, the goats are wrought in galvanized steel and glass, the act of receiving nourishment represented by a bottle of milk that sits atop the structure. The ensemble calls to mind the Chinese domestic ancestral altar, at which offerings, prayers, and entreaties to ones forebears are performed in recognition of history, ancestry, and veneration of age-old wisdom. Inscribed on the bottle, which also represents the necessity of nourishment to future generations, are the characters . This refers to a forest pathway or trail, and in the sculpture is a metaphoric allusion to the theme of insight.\nOur Children also demonstrates Tangs skillful distillation of concept and commentary into a visual message and a prompt to reflection. In this work, the two figures appear in dynamic tension and resemble Chinese characters, bringing to life the narrative theme in spare lines and forms. (The parable itself is less smoothly concluded, the boy tragically failing to reconcile with his mother after his revelation.) Recalling Tangs seminal early work Tigers Whip (1991), a commentary on the exploitation of tigers for their organs supposed aphrodisiac powers, the work sees Tang explore the interaction of nature and culture. Investigative, rather than simply didactic, his works are intended to inspire rather than merely instruct.\nJune Yap\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nTran Luongs practice spans painting, installation, and performance art. The artist came to international prominence in the late 1980s and early 90s as part of a group of artists in post-oi Moi Vietnamthat is, after the formalization of socialist economic reformscalled the Gang of Five. The group produced works with aesthetics and subjects that did not conform to the traditions of Vietnamese fine art or craft. Through performance art in particular however, post-oi Moi artists engendered a new freedom. Yet the medium is still subject to official disapproval and, as a result, is often presented away from public scrutiny. But while it may suffer from a lack of official and institutional acknowledgement, performance art in Hanoi is distinguished by a strong community, and by the creation of spaces and possibilities for dialogue on art practice in general. One such locus is Nha San uc, co-founded by Tran Luong with Nguyen Manh uc.\nTrans three-channel video installation Lap Loe (roughly, blink or flicker) is derived from a performance by the artist that began in 2007, inspired by the sight of his son returning from school wearing a red scarf that reminded him of his own childhood. The artist invited audiences at his first performance in China to snap a red scarfan item of historical and political significance associated with communismagainst his body, as if play-fighting. The performance was repeated at eleven other sites including cities in Vietnam, Korea, Indonesia, and Singapore. Audience reactions differed widely from place to place, with the scarf taking on diverse significances and provoking a variety of reactions. Lap Loe comments on the history and status of Vietnam by documenting the performances various incarnations. The image of the scarf remains ambiguous, its rising, snapping, falling movements never more than allusive or suggestive. While the lashing scarf is, for the artist, a cause of pain, it is also a transitory phenomenon and a catalyst for understanding. In a statement accompanying the work, the artist writes: La nhung so phan bat trac / Nhung lan chop truoc con mua giong / La an om om, la tran chien nhin tu xa . . . / Hay su co gang cua tan tro truoc khi tat lim. (The uncertain fates / Lightning before the storm / The fireflies or battles as seen from afar . . . / Efforts of embers, before they are extinguished). The allegorical text, which reflects on a moment of transition from one stage to the next, is intentionally ambivalent even as it signals the inevitability of change to come.\nJune Yap\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nWah Nu and Tun Win Aungs expansive multi-component work Thousand Pieces of White (2009 ) reflects on 30 years of personal experience; the collaborating artists have established an archive of objects, images, printed matter, and film footage, all on the subject of memory, with each artifact displayed partially concealed beneath a layer of white. Underscoring the way in which memorys ephemerality works, paradoxically, to enhance its significance, this equalizing veneer also conveys the gradual decay and erasure of links to the past. The fragments that remain visible offer glimpses of public and personal histories, revealing elements of Myanmars social, political, and cultural narrative. Yet these partial views are also ambiguous, at once manifesting and obscuring in a manner that is both familiar within contemporary art practice and appropriate to the navigation of a complex national situation. Every element in the artists collection of evidence is intimately associated with them, reflecting their having lived through the changes associated with post-independence socialism and military governance, and their current lives in the context of still-evolving political circumstances.\nSome Pieces of White assembles four components of the couples more politically inflected experiences. White Piece #0131: Forbidden Hero (Breeze Before Storm), White Piece #0132: Forbidden Hero (Heads), and White Piece #0134: His Last Speech We Heard from Myanmar Radio on 19 July of Some Years Ago, all from 2012, reference the figure of Bogyoke (General) Aung San, who played an instrumental role in the nations achievement of autonomy from colonial rule and occupation (though he was assassinated before independence was officially attained). While he received popular support in his time, restrictions were placed on representations of the General once martial law was imposed in 1989.   In this installation, 40 replica busts of the General face a lightbox, their features thus both illuminated and half-concealed. Juxtaposed with these are a page from a local newspaper and a three-second video loop with an audio recording of Aung Sans titular half-hour speech, in which the forbidden hero articulates his hopes for the nation. Yet these attempts at piecing together the memory of the figure also reveal its incompleteness, emphasizing that which has been lost. Similarly, it is but a fragment of history that is recovered in the installations second video, White Piece #0133: Thakin Pe Thans Long March (2012). Here, Wah Nus grandfather is shown taking part in a revolutionary march against the British colonizers in October 1938. In these subtle interventions, the ephemeral nature of historic specificity positions objects and images as the starting points of vital narratives.\nJune Yap \n",

Lee's innovative body of work revolves around the notion of encounterseeing the bare existence of what is actually before us and focusing on \"the world as it is.\"\nBorn in Korea in 1936, Lee studied painting at the College of Fine Arts at Seoul National University and philosophy at Nihon University in Tokyo. He rose to prominence in the late 1960s as the leading theorist and practitioner of Mono-ha (School of Things), a Japanese art movement that developed from the collapse of colonial world orders, antiauthoritarian protests, and the rise of modernity critiques. Lee's sculptures, presenting dispersed arrangements of stones together with industrial materials like steel plates, rubber sheets, and glass panes, recast the discrete object as a network of relations based on parity between the viewer, materials, and site. Lee was also a pivotal figure in the Korean tansaekhwa (monochrome painting) school, which offered a fresh approach to minimalist abstraction by presenting repetitive gestural marks as bodily records of time's perpetual passage. Lee has coupled his artistic practice with a prodigious body of critical and philosophical writings.\nFor Lee, restraint in creating arteven letting what has been created disappearshifts the status of his works from that of material objects to fleeting lived experiences, and his nonproduction emerges as a nuanced critique of the Western societal prevalence of surplus and overproduction. Relatum, the title of all Lee's sculptures, is a philosophical term denoting things or events between which a relation exists. This radical approach to the artwork, not as an object but as a network of relationships, shifts artistic experience to an act of encounter, an occasion that unfolds around the viewer in a particular time and space. Since his early Mono-ha period, Lee has restricted his choice of materials to steel plates and stones, focusing on their precise conceptual and spatial juxtaposition. The steel platehard, heavy, solidis used to build things in the modern world; the stone, in its natural, as-is state, \"belongs to an unknown world,\" as the artist puts it, beyond the self and outside modernity, evoking the Other or \"externality.\"\nRelatumdialogue (2002/11) presents two steel sheets laid on top of one another, slightly askew, and flanked by two large rocks suggesting a model of identity and difference. Lee approaches his sculptures with the same attention to resonant space, emptiness, and stillness that is seen in his paintings. The rocks become like brush marks placed in a dynamic interplay with the surrounding space, which is always in flux. Lee does not seek to create permanent monuments, but rather to open up spaces for engagement through minimal intervention in disciplined acts of selecting and arranging.\r\n\nAlexandra Munroe\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nFounded by Anjalika Sagar and Kodwo Eshun, the Otolith Group produces multiform projects that elaborate on theoretical, conceptual, aural, and visual trajectories. Their research-based practice lends itself to curatorial and publishing experiments as much as it does to works in installation and film. Based in London, the groups work is characterized by a transnationality that defies the exclusionary strategies of global geopolitics while engaging with its problems and implications.\nIn Communists Like Us (200610), the group selects and sequences photographic images from two archives bequeathed by the educationalist Dr. Anasuya Gyan-Chand to her daughter Chitra Gyan-Chand, who in 2006 passed them on to Anjalika Sagar. Titled Daughter Products I and II, the archives consist of photographic documentation of encounters between politicians and activists in India with their counterparts in Japan, Maos China, and other Asian countries from the mid 1950s to the early 60s, as well as visits by delegations of female activists from India to the Soviet Union throughout the same period. The term daughter products is derived from atomic physics and is used here to allude to the generational aspect of radioactive decay. Communists Like Us interleaves a visual narrative composed from these images of socialist friendship with a textual narrative extracted from the subtitled conversation between revolutionary activist Francis Jeanson and Veronique, a Maoist student played by Anne Wiazemsky, in Jean Luc Godards 1967 film La Chinoise.\nIn the sequence selected from La Chinoise, which is set on a train, Veronique and Jeanson debate the efficacy of revolutionary violence. Jeansons side of the dialogue is assigned to the back of the archival photographs and Veroniques the front, while the nature of the conversation influences the display of the image, its absence, or its original annotation. The conjunction of conversation and photographic image is further framed by two musical sequences from Cornelius Cardew and the Scratch Orchestras The Great Learning (1969) and Ennio Morricones soundtrack to Dario Argentos film Il Gatto a nove code (The Cat O Nine Tails) (1971). The photographic archive attests to an intimate and extensive postwar exchange in Asia, which is contrasted with the generational debate over revolutionary desire in La Chinoise. Communists Like Us thus plots two interlinked orbits around questions of representation and manifestation. Titled after Communists Like Us: New Spaces Of Alliance, New Lines (1990), in which philosophers Felix Guattari and Antonio Negri discuss the political project of autonomy in the era prior to the collapse of communism, Communists Like Us began in 2006 as a performance at Huis a/d Werf in Utrecht, and exemplifies the experimental and enquiring nature of the Otolith Groups practice. \nJune Yap\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\n...And Europe Will Be Stunned (200711) centers on a young Polish politicians call for the return of 3.3 million Jewish emigrants to their ancestral homeland. A contemporary riff on Leni Riefenstahls Nazi propaganda films, this trilogy drifts among the idioms of documentary, biopic, and art-house drama, in a story that folds fiction with events past and present. The series opens with Mary Koszmary (Nightmares) set in the ruins of Warsaws Stadion Dziesieciolecia (Decennial Stadium), where politician Sawomir Sierakowski issues a cry to the vacant fields, summoning the return of the Jewish people to Poland. In the second film, Mur I Wieza (Wall and Tower), the politicians idealistic followers, members of the Jewish Renaissance Movement in Poland (JRMiP), heed his behest; at the site of the former Warsaw Ghetto, they build a tower-and-stockade-style kibbutz, a settlement method developed by Zionists in the British Mandate of Palestine during the 193639 Arab Revolt. Intended for external protection as well as internal control, the barbed wirewrapped wall and tower evokes the feeling of captivity to those within and impenetrability to outsiders. The concluding film, Zamach (Assasination), presents the assassination of Sierakowskis character by an unknown assailant, a tragedy that, as seen through his followers words of eulogy, solidifies the imagined JRMiP. Borrowing from symbols of Polands and Israels past, Bartana reconfigures their context, raising issues of displacement and assimilation. Braiding the real with the fictive, ...And Europe Will Be Stunned proposes alternate ideas and narratives in order to reconsider pre-constructed, accepted conclusions.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nA Palestinian-Kuwaiti who has never been to his Palestinian homeland, Tarek Al-Ghoussein situates himself as a protagonist struggling with his surroundings in his series Self Portrait (200203), A Series (200304), B Series (200506), C Series (2007), and D Series (2008), as well as his recent projects D2 Series (2009) and E Series (2010). Intentionally borrowing from the Greek myth of Sisyphus, a figure condemned to repeatedly and eternally pushing a boulder up a mountain, the artist alludes to the mythical character's frustratingly cyclical existence and the underlying need for a call to revolt that he inspires. By extension, the figure of the Palestinian, whose news-media depiction during the Palestinian Intifada often included images of protests and rock throwing, is caught in a similar uphill battle, struggling for revolution. The fraught layers of resistance, longing, and belonging are reflected in the figure's physical and psychological relation to the landscape and environment. The land becomes the self-portrait of a complicated identity and history.\nAl-Ghoussein is influenced by the New Topographic movement in photography, led by Robert Adams and Frank Gohlke, and he experiments with the idea of the staging and theatricality of nothingness. As a way of negotiating identity in his photographic series, Al-Ghoussein draws out this \"nothing\" with landforms and physical obstacles, situating the figure as an interruption in the overall composition. The A Series and B Series feature the artist in different locations, approaching or standing near some sort of barriera construction inspired in part by the erection of the West Bank Wall. With the C Series, the artist introduced a blue tarp that stands in for the illusive home or shelter. Al-Ghoussein shows himself dragging the tarp or covered by it in almost tentlike formations. It becomes the dominant element in the composition, with the figure barely present as the artist is subsumed by the vastness of his surroundings. These series address the impermanence and transience of a nomadic, diasporic lifethe displacement and isolation of the figure in the landscape suggesting the individual's personal Sisyphean struggle to understand his or her relationship to the environment and world.\nIn Untitled 5 (from D Series, 2008), the tarp is gone; only the head and shoulders of the figure are visible, and he appears to be standing in a trench. Piles of sand next to the hole suggest that it was recently dug. Through an open gate and beyond two sets of walls, the utility poles and treetops of a city or village are visible. Despite the call of what lies ahead, the figure remains immobile, submerged in the landscape, his gaze imperceptible to the viewer. In Untitled 5, the figure has been mapped and displaced, fixed in place in the trench. This photograph, as well as others in the series, are mournful meditations on the barriers, both physical and abstract, that prevent the artist from returning to his homeland.\nReem Fadda\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\n1392 Moon Jars (Wind) (200810), is a large-scale installation that embodies seemingly disparate, even oppositional ideas, such as totality and individuality, irregularity and order, and singularity and conformity. It is composed of more than a thousand ceramic jars, each about 8 cm tall, which are arranged on the floor in concentric circles, making up a large circle just over 400 cm in diameter. The original moon jar was made during the Chosun Dynasty (13921910), and is so named for its milky glaze and \"full moon\" shape. The jars in Kang's work were hand thrown and fired in a Korean kiln that is known for making moon jars. Each vessel is deliberately imperfect, revealing the touch of its maker, and is formed from two parts of clay, the bottom half and the top. The two semi-spheres are connected by hand, often resulting in a visible joint mark near the middle and slight irregularities in the overall form. Thus each jar is different, although when viewed together with the other jars in the installation, it becomes one component of a larger whole.\nThe tension between wholeness and separation is integral to the work's meaning, since 1392 Moon Jars (Wind) is informed by spiritual and political concerns. The work's mysterious nature is enhanced by its phenomenological impact: When viewers speak to one another across the installation, the jars cause the sound of their voices to vibrate and amplify, and the natural force of the wind becomes linked to breath. The two halves of each jar also serve as a metaphor for Korea, which was forced to divide into two countries after World War II, when the Soviet Union and the United States assumed control of the country but backed different leaders, resulting in the formation of two different states. Throughout Ik-Joong Kang's oeuvre, the jar functions as an eloquent articulation of his desire for the reunification of Korea. About a similar piece, entitled Moon Jar (2006), which Kang made for the Korean Mission to the United Nations, he wrote: \"It becomes one body and it starts breathing air into the sky. The Moon Jar exemplifies oneness from this connection.\"1 Indeed, although the jars are empty, the parenthetical in the title, \"wind,\" suggests that viewers should think of them as holding immaterial and elusive concepts, such as time, memory, dreams, and hope, namely the hope that a divided country will one day be unified.\nClaire Barliant\n1.

    "description": "\nDescription\nThe title of Khadim Alis Rustam Series (201112) references the hero of the Persian Shahnameh (Book of kings). The protagonist of Ferdowsis 11th-century epic poem is recognized for his valor and strength, but Alis work recalls only his name; the paintings allude to the persecution of the Hazara minority in Afghanistan and Pakistan, a community that finds itself displaced on both sides of the border. The work depicts demons, and suggests that the legendary character of the Rustam has been usurped in contemporary times as justification for hostility and bloodshed, his heroism now ascribed to those who perpetrate violence and domination. In a broader sense, the work reflects on the upheavals and crises that emerge from lingering difference.\nSuccessive cycles of violence and aggression are not limited to this particular minority community, but recur in oppressive circumstances elsewhere. In its reference to the narrative and lyrical traditions of the Persian people and the region, Alis work recollects both the triumph of civilizations past and the turmoil and aftermath of conquest. Yet in spite of loss, there linger traces of individual and cultural memory, of which the return of the Rustam is one. Layered in these works are excerpts from epic poems and literary references to Persian and Afghan history and culture, keys to meaning that the violence of contemporary conflict cannot efface. Also depicted in the series of paintings are the silent and empty alcoves in cliffs that were once occupied by the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan. Though these 6th-century statues were destroyed in 2001, their physical absence, like that of the Rustam, has a haunting aura of its own.\nFollowing the style of miniature painting, and in particular the technique of neem rang (half-color), the artist uses traditional methods of production including pigmentation with gold and silver leaf. This traditional South Asian aesthetic, now also marked by Persian influences, is a form of Mughal painting that was once used in illustrated texts, primarily to represent royalty, battles, and legends. The rich and sensitive detailing of these historical portraits is, like the literary epic, revived in Alis work, which accords the traditional practice a contemporary relevance by aligning its cultural significance with the circumstances of today. \nJune Yap\n",

Lee's innovative body of work revolves around the notion of encounterseeing the bare existence of what is actually before us and focusing on \"the world as it is.\"\nBorn in Korea in 1936, Lee studied painting at the College of Fine Arts at Seoul National University and philosophy at Nihon University in Tokyo. He rose to prominence in the late 1960s as the leading theorist and practitioner of Mono-ha (School of Things), a Japanese art movement that developed from the collapse of colonial world orders, antiauthoritarian protests, and the rise of modernity critiques. Lee's sculptures, presenting dispersed arrangements of stones together with industrial materials like steel plates, rubber sheets, and glass panes, recast the discrete object as a network of relations based on parity between the viewer, materials, and site. Lee was also a pivotal figure in the Korean tansaekhwa (monochrome painting) school, which offered a fresh approach to minimalist abstraction by presenting repetitive gestural marks as bodily records of time's perpetual passage. Lee has coupled his artistic practice with a prodigious body of critical and philosophical writings.\nFor Lee, restraint in creating arteven letting what has been created disappearshifts the status of his works from that of material objects to fleeting lived experiences, and his nonproduction emerges as a nuanced critique of the Western societal prevalence of surplus and overproduction.\nDialogue (2010) is an emblematic painting of Lee's recent eponymous series, which consists of minimal marks placed on a white gesso ground. The limited number of discrete strokes made with a broad, flat brush loaded with gray paint positioned in charged configurations on expanses of white unpainted ground evokes a generative emptiness. Created as an act of intense concentration guided by an ethics of restraint, Dialogue emphatically affirms the painting's own physicality, as well as the infinite.\nAlexandra Munroe\n",

Incorrectly believing Chinese characters to be ideograms, or symbols that graphically represent ideas, Pound developed a poetic style in which abstract concepts were expressed through combinations of concrete images. This pictographic transfer between image and text inspired Lisa Oppenheim, who developed Cathay from a poem fragment by the eighth-century Chinese poet Li Bai that Pound had adapted for his book. Comparing that version with a more recent, scholarly translation, Oppenheim found that while Pounds text was in many ways incorrect, it possessed a warmth and spirit lost in the more literal, contemporary version. To tease out these differences, she made two synchronized films based on the texts, referencing Pounds Imagistic theory by replacing phrases with static shots taken in New Yorks Chinatown. As the piece begins, Pounds translation reads in full on the left while the contemporary translation is seen entirely through images on the right; as the films proceed, images intercede with Pounds text and the contemporary translation is revealed on the right. At no point is the original Chinese text seenrather, viewers are presented with an ever-shifting variety of interpretations from which they can only hope to deduce the source.\nNat Trotman\n",

She studied sculpture in art school, but rather than fabricate solid materials that respond to or oppose architecture, she chooses instead to record herself singing without instrumental accompaniment, then broadcasts the recordings in public places. Her sound pieces take advantage of the amplification of water under a bridge, for example (The Lost Reflection, made for the Skulptur Projekte Munster, 2007), or subtly infiltrate the chatter and hubbub at a crowded bus station (In Guadalupe, commissioned by ArtPace San Antonio and installed at the San Antonio Greyhound bus station in 2003). The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum commissioned Philipsz to make a new piece for the 2010 exhibition Haunted: Contemporary Photography/Video/Performance. Philipsz responded both to the theme of the exhibition, which focused on art made with new technologies that embodies a melancholic longing for the past, as well as the Guggenheim Museum's iconic building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. She sang a version of the traditional folk song \"Willow Waly,\" which had been sung by a child for the 1961 film The Innocents, which in turn was based on Henry James's The Turn of the Screw. Both the book and the film address the notion of childhood innocence and its possible corruption when exposed to adult emotions such as desire or fear. The opening lyric reinforces the story's tragic theme: \"We lay my love and I beneath the weeping willow. But now alone I lie and weep beside the tree.\"\nThe song played every ten minutes in the Guggenheim Museum's rotunda, echoing throughout the space. The mournful, folklike melody resonated within the modern interior, evoking a pastoral setting that could be seen as incongruous with Wright's sinuous white design. Philipsz specializes in triggering these kinds of uncanny juxtapositions: Using only her voice, she manages to hark back to a distant and elusive past while simultaneously making listeners profoundly aware of their present surroundings.\nClaire Barliant\n",

Beginning with a paper construction of cut-up forms and handmade patterns, Feser uses an analog camera to photograph the composition repeatedly, capturing multiple views of the three-dimensional structure. These images are then digitally processed using techniques such as retouching and superimposition. The exchanges between the artists hand, the cameras lens, and digital manipulation compound to complicate the fundamental elements of photography: light, shadow, and subject. The resulting images address the origin and perception of digitally generated images. The layered surfaces accumulate through the artists painstaking process and present a tactile terrain that remains two-dimensional despite the seemingly haptic, interposed layers and definitively optic experiences of the viewer.\nCarmen Hermo\n",

In Rehearsal for a Reunion (with the Father of Pottery) (2011), Fujiwara uses a difficult relationship with a distant father as the starting point for a humorous, circuitous video that reenacts a real-life experience through the rehearsal of a screenplay about it. Fujiwara visited Japan to reconnect with his father, and using craft as a kind of catharsis, they together created a tea set in the style of mid-twentieth-century British ceramist Bernard Leach. The tea set becomes the central prop in the titular rehearsal depicted in the film, with the artist in the role of the son and an actor as his father. The video progresses through enmeshed layers of fiction and reality, culminating in a moment of destruction and release. The remnants of this outburst are collected into an almost anthropological installation that seems to enshrine elements of Fujiwaras endeavor, though it is unclear whether the truth, an artistic interpretation of it, or an outright fiction is on displaya slippage that is paralleled in the two portraits of Fujiwara and his father, one costumed and the other real.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nHo Tzu Nyens multichannel video installation The Cloud of Unknowing (2011) explores the expansive subject of the representation of the elusive and amorphous cloud. Inspired by philosopher Hubert Damischs thesis on the forms aesthetics and symbolism, A Theory of /Cloud/: Toward a History of Painting, first published in French in 1972, Hos work incorporates a set of eight compartmentalized vignettes, each centered on a character that stands for the clouds representation in historically significant Western European artworks by artists including Caravaggio, Francisco de Zurbaran, Antonio da Correggio, Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini, Andrea Mantegna, and Rene Magritte, as well as the Eastern landscapes of Mi Fu and Wen Zhengming. This incorporation and blending of cultural, historical, and philosophical references, both Eastern and Western, is prevalent in Hos practice, which references painting (EARTH, 2009), pop music (The Bohemian Rhapsody Project, 2006), literature (The King Lear Project, 2008) and philosophy (Zarathustra: A Film for Everyone and No One, 2009).\nHos practice speaks to the predicament of representing and interpreting contemporary art from South and Southeast Asia, and specifically from Singapore. In 1963, Singapore gained independence as part of the nation of Malaysia during the immediate postcolonial and postwar period; however in 1965, due to mutual differences, Singapore separated to become a country of its own. For this reason, and given the physical and cultural migration from South and East Asia into Malaya (the pre-independent region of Singapore and Malaysia), the sources of Singapores historical and art-historical narratives are entwined with that of its neighbors, and are often represented in terms of cultural and traditional assimilation and transformation. Hos art confronts foundational myths and historical geopolitics, and deconstructs the idea of modernization via Western influence or beneficence, by presenting viewers with a paradox. In it, Eastern and Western forms appear at once disjointed and seamless, coexisting in a fluid aesthetic interpretation that allows for the complexities of influence and adaptation to drift through each other, akin to the eponymous cloud. \nContrasted with the substantial figures of the works eight characters, each of which struggles against the burden of physical and material existence and the trappings of obsession and clutter, decay and disrepair, are their unexpected confrontations with the ethereal cloud. Hos installation is titled after a mystical treatise from the 14th century, written in the tradition of the Christian Neoplatonists, whose authorship is little-known, and which was intended as a primer for aspiring monastics on the art of contemplative prayer. In Hos work, the metaphorical limits of human knowledge that the medieval spiritual text anticipates as inevitable in the search for the divine are represented in the form of terrifying, surreal, or sometimes illuminative encounters with a corporeal cloud of unknowing. But these encounters with doubt and uncertainty, as guided by the gnostic text, are transitory, and the spiritual traveler is exhorted to keep the faith and trust that understanding will arrive. In Hos work, the binary division of Eastern and Western thought, belief, history, and representation, would appear to have collapsed, suggesting the possibility of new insight. \nJune Yap\n",

Inserting this aesthetic into the context of an exhibition, she challenges the systems of circulation and display through which cultural imagery acquires meaning, conflating art objects with commodities. Afrikan Spir (2011) takes its title from an obscure nineteenth-century Russian philosopher who espoused the redistribution of wealth and studied the essential properties of individual and universal identity. Its pristine, mass-market framework is dotted with disparate objectsa taxidermied raven, a digital print of actress Tippi Hedren of Alfred Hitchcocks The Birds (1963), a lacy black stockingand decked in mirrors, glass, and steel. As visually alluring as a shop window, the work presents an amalgam of Hollywood tropes and considers how signifiers of the glamorous and the Gothic have become divested of their original meaning and are now simply part of mainstream society. Here, American cultural imperialism, heralded by Hollywood, is sardonically sanitized. A critique of the extravagances of commercialism, Afrikan Spir also crucially includes a small mounted mirrorreflecting back the visage of the viewer and embedding the visitor among so many things bought and sold.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nInformed commentaries on recent art practice in Cambodia invariably make reference to the period of the Khmer Rouge or Communist Party of Kampuchea, which has impacted the country ever since its 197579 rule.  Sopheap Pich was born in the agricultural town of Battambang in Cambodia, and left the country with his family as a refugee at the end of the Khmer Rouges reign, subsequently settling in the United States. However, memories of his childhood experiences in Cambodia and a desire to reconnect with its life drew the artist back to the country in 2002. On returning he was faced with the challenge of relating the contemporary artistic methodologies with which he had become acquainted to local cultural conditions, and to the demands of postKhmer Rouge political and economic recovery. Through the use of rattan and bamboo, materials familiar from Khmer rural life and craft (they are used to make functional everyday objects such as baskets and fish traps), Pichs oeuvre bridges the aesthetic and material gulfs between the two. Repurposing these basic components of Cambodian life, he instills the countries shared experience with renewed life.\nPichs early sculptures assume biomorphic forms that represent an essential symbiosis between history and culture, past and present. Such synthesis recurs throughout the artists work; in his sculpture The Duel (2008), for example, two organ-like forms that resemble the cavities of the lungs or the chambers of the heart appear intrinsically linked, even as the title of the work suggests a conflicted relationship. The artist characterizes his forms as real, alluding to their expression of tangible existence and experience, that relate to his sense of an inexorable kinship with his country. In Morning Glory (2011), the ubiquitous plant is rendered at monumental scale. Considered a weed by gardeners, it is a plant that, like Pichs bamboo and rattan, is generally regarded as unexceptional. However, in Pichs sculpture, its status is more ambivalent, at once attractive and a possible nuisance, banal but also valued by Cambodians during the Khmer Rouge regime as a source of nourishment. Transforming the rigid stalks into a more malleable substance, Pich treats the material like a line, making a drawing in space. In its metamorphosis, this spare structure refutes its lightweight appearance with a strength that infuses Cambodian life and culture. \nJune Yap\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nMumbai-based artist Shilpa Gupta addresses the weighty issues of religion, nationality, and history with wry humor. Using video, sculpture, photography, and sound, she distills critical observations into pithy reflections on conditions in South Asia. In 1:14.9 (201112), a hand-wound ball of thread is accompanied by a small plaque reading 1188.5 MILES OF FENCED BORDER  WEST, NORTH-WEST / DATA UPDATE: DEC 31, 2007. Using sterile data about the fencing of the border between India and Pakistan extracted from a publicly available report by the Ministry of Home Affairs in India, she poetically represents the geopolitical division as a gleaming orba form that seems, at first, as abstract as the raw statistics from which it is derived. Yet the threads fragility reflects the tenuous nature of national boundaries, which demand constant restatement and surveillance. The objects ovoid shape also suggests origins or genesis, and calls to mind the South Asian partition, which occurred either side of midnight on August 14, 1947, birthing two distinct nations in immediate succession.\nThis fraught moment in history, which has repercussions to this day, is referenced more obliquely in Guptas Threat (200809), a wall of bricks, each one stamped with the single word of the title. The tension of this division is, however, illusory, as the bricks are made from water-soluble soap. This testing of the borders instability recurs in 100 Hand Drawn Maps of India (200708) and 100 Hand Drawn Maps (2010), components of a larger ongoing project. For these works, the artist travelled from India to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, inviting participants to draw maps from memory. Layering these drawings atop one another, she illustrates the mercurial nature of nation as idea and, as the works lines intersect and diverge, its ambivalent and logocentric status (a characteristic previously remarked on by theorist Homi K. Bhabha). By using commonplace objects and materials to navigate the ideological and the physical, 1:14.9 reflects an interesting aspect of Indian aesthetics. The familiar textile material is used with measured allegorical purpose, drawing attention to ordinary realities distinct from the triumphalism found in the art championed by independent India, epitomized in Abanindranath Tagores famous painting Bharat Mata (Mother India) (190405). \nJune Yap \n",

In Phantom Library (201112), Kurant realized a set of books that had only existed as fictitious endeavors by characters in the works of writers like Jorge Luis Borges, Philip K. Dick, and Vladimir Nabokov. This physical manifestation capitalizes on the untapped creative potential previously trapped within an imagined realm. Kurant gleaned information on each book-within-a-books plot, characters, and themes; created jacket copy and a unique graphic identity for each volume; and further legitimized them with barcodes and ISBN numbers that establish these tomes within the economy of the publishing world. Though the volumes remain largely blank inside, certain pages of select books are interleaved with black-and-white images that depict stars and planets in space, alluding to the expansive possibilities of realizing the unreal and to the insignificance of the individual amid greater forces.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nFormed in 2006, the Propeller Group is a Ho Chi Minh City and Los Angelesbased collective composed of artists Phunam, Matt Lucero, and Tuan Andrew Nguyen. The convergence of the diverse backgrounds of its membersantique sculpture, photography, oil painting, performance, installation, filmmaking, and videohas, in conjunction with various cultural influences, resulted in a versatile aesthetic and a mutable sense of heritage. The group questions the very possibility of fixed cultural origin, its work demonstrating how identities are heightened through difference and influence. Viet Nam The World Tour (2010 ) takes the form of what the artists term a rogue anti-nation branding campaign. Employing the aesthetics of viral video and graffiti in collaborations with dancers, street artists, writers, and designers, the group subverts the kind of nationalistic representation that is often couched in dominant politics and colonial histories. This ongoing project articulates an inclusive idea of Vietnam that focuses not only on its people, but also on its diaspora, and even on the non-Vietnamese experience, producing works in dance, graffiti, mural painting, and video that extend the limits of national narrative. Since its inception, the tour has traveled to Amsterdam, Brisbane, Kabul, Los Angeles, Lyon, Paris, Ho Chi Minh City, and Singapore. \nThe groups collaborative approach and their interest in the idea of the anti-brand both appear in Television Commercial for Communism (TVCC) (201112), in which a platform for dialogue is created on the subject of communism by inviting an advertising company to pitch a rebranding of the ideology in the postCold War era. Curious to see how contemporary promotional strategies might be applied to the ideology, the work performs a deconstruction that collapses the historical into the contemporary. TVCC consists of three parts: the first is a multichannel video installation that documents advertising firm TBWA\\Vietnams brainstorming session around communisms positive brand identity; the second, an animatic that charts the development of ideas for the commercial; and finally, the resultant spot. The project may be understood not only in relation to the political ideology of Vietnam, but also to the history of the Vietnam War, the first war in which news coverage demonstrably influenced political and public opinion.\nIn producing TVCC, the group explores historical and contemporary relationships between communism and capitalism, reflecting philosopher Alain Badious proposal that the hypothesis of communism (as distinct from its form) is still viable, and that the future of the ideology lies in its expansion. Distilled from the brainstorming session are the general concepts of equality, cooperation, and sharing. These are then developed into an uncannily convincing minute-long advertisement.\nJune Yap\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nTo create A Flor de Piel, Doris Salcedo sutured together hundreds of rose petals into a delicate shroud that undulates softly on the floor. Suspended in a state of transformation, the petals linger between life and death and are so vulnerable that they tear if touched. For Salcedo, fragility becomes the essence of the work as she sought to create an image that is immaterial. The title is a Spanish idiomatic expression used to describe an overt display of emotions. While that meaning is lost when literally translated, the phrase a flor de piel links flowers and skin, suggesting a sensation so overwhelming that it is expressed physically through a coloring of the bodys surface.Salcedos installations and sculptures often employ minimal forms that subtly evoke the fragility of human life. Viewed in light of the brutal civil war in Salcedos native Colombia, this aesthetic sensibility takes on specific political resonances. Salcedo conceived the work A Flor de Piel while she was researching the events surrounding a female nurse who was tortured to death in Colombia and whose dismembered body has never been found. The artist has described the work as a floral offering to this victim of torture, as well as all of those who have been affected by violence. Suturing the petals is very important because it was a way to bring together all these parts, Salcedo has said. Violence destroys everything. Torture destroys bodies. The idea is to bring them together and unite them and recover the force that they had.1\nLauren Hinkson \n1.

Yet these artifacts also point to the world beyond, referring to politics, popular culture, philosophy, and artistic traditions. Placed side by side, the objects loosely portray particular intellectual epochs and historical moments, often with a nod to the social upheaval and idealism of the 1960s. In Vague Pure Affection (2012), books, photographs, found objects, and small sculptures allude to drug culture and the expanded consciousness that many hoped to achieve through the use of psychedelics. However, Bove has drawn the works title from a volume that does not appear on the shelves: the 1901 Theosophist treatise Thought-Forms by Annie Besant and C. W. Leadbeater. This text, which outlines the shapes and colors of auras associated with various mental states, greatly influenced the invention of abstract painting by Vasily Kandinsky and others. In Boves hands, these juxtapositions form intuitive and open-ended webs of meaning, based as much on formal resonances and personal associations as on strict facts.\n",

In these installations, the individual components and their collective significance are accentuated, opening up otherwise ordinary objects to manifold interpretation.  \nLikewise, in Full Moon (2012), Gill disassembles and resequences books from her grandfathers collection. The contents of Full Moons liberated pages range from technical explanations, economic analyses, and sociopolitical commentaries to the fictional, transcendental, and spiritual. Their origins include such seminal tomes as The Affluent Society by John Kenneth Galbraith, Primitive Culture: Researches into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Language, Art, and Custom by Edward Burnett Tylor, The Impact of Science on Society by Bertrand Russell, and The Crowded World: The Problem and Eugenics in Evolutionary Perspective by Julian Huxley. Foregrounding these texts, Gill inscribes their shuffled leaves with circular designs in ink, gouache, grass pigment, laundry detergent, and correction fluid. These methodical but still lively markings effectively recalibrate the diversity of the pages theoretical content, bringing them into unexpected congruence or commensuration. Unmoored from their bindings, they attain a literal and metaphorical lightness characteristic of Gills oeuvre, an understated humor that here surfaces in a resistance to the gravity of the texts scholarship and cultural importance. A similar critical antagonism is established in 9 Volumes from The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (2008). Remodeling each tome into a ball with which viewers may interact, Gill pairs the reverence ascribed by the volumes provenance with the simple satisfaction of play that is afforded by their new tactile form.\nPinned to the wall in a row, the pages of Full Moon appear to frame each other or coalesce into groupings as one moves from work to work, or when viewed at a distance. As their details swim in and out of focus, the certainty of the truths they embody seems also to waver. Attempting to produce this most basic of shapes upon these textual surfaces, Gills exercises in understanding present aspirations to perfection that, like the fullness of the moon, are difficult to perceive with the naked eye.\nJune Yap \n",

The works began as a private form of release for the artist, away from his more formal butterfly paintings, such as Untitled (Blue Painting Light to Dark X) (2006). Constructed from mundane materials such as art supply boxes and toilet-paper rolls, some masks, such as those formed from beer boxes that the artist saved from his wedding, carry more personal significance. Loosely figurative, the masks invoke childhood craft projects while also referencing in resolutely primitive forms various art-historical predecessors. Grotjahn has recently begun casting his studio experiments in bronze and expressively painting the surfaces, as in Untitled (Ten Dollar Foxes, White on Red Mask M14.d) (2012). \nLauren Hinkson\n",

All in the Family (2012), an upright, top-heavy construction painted deep aubergine, acts as a display mechanism for a bright orange Hoover Vacuum Cleaner. This classic domestic appliance poses as a sculptural artifact or a figure from a retro sitcom, while alluding to Jeff Koonss seminal 1980s series of encased vacuum cleaners. Blazing Saddles (2003), which takes its name from Mel Brookss 1974 satirical Western, features a framed production still from The Fuller Brush Girl (1950) showing Lucille Ball being held in a stickup by two children dressed in cowboy costumes. Above this image sits an empty case of Campbells Barbecue Beans, calling to mind Andy Warhols soup cans and silkscreened boxes of the early 1960s, as if to say that Pop Art itself may continually be repackaged and resold, much like other exports of mid-century Americana.\n",

Her portrait series Faces and Phases (2006) focuses on the regions black lesbian community, presenting her subjects frontally, their penetrating gazes stoic yet vulnerable. The word faces in the title refers to this face-to-face confrontationbetween sitter and photographer, between sitter and viewerwhile phases suggests the transitional quality of how the subjects express their gender and sexual identity. Muholi intends phases to commemorate the communitys losses to AIDS as well as to hate crimes. Many of those portrayed are survivors of scathing prejudice, yet these portraits venture beyond the harrowing image of the victim. Instead, through these emotive yet restrained photographs, Muholi documents the depth of a community that is underrepresented and stigmatized both in South Africa and abroad.\n",

Together, these items begin to formulate a specific portrait, even as they flatten its subject into a collage-like abstraction.

Over the course of thirteen minutes, the video tells the story of the creation of the universe through a cascade of images that pop up, collide, and implode across a computer screen. Set to a soundtrack of a rapid-fire spoken-word poem, written in collaboration with poet Jacob Bromberg, the narrative blends scientific histories with creation stories from a variety of major religions (Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism), faiths (Freemasonry, Kabbalah), and indigenous traditions (Dogon, Inuit, Navajo).

    "description": "\nDescription\nLaced with sardonic humor, Nate Lowmans paintings, photographs, sculptures, and installations use strategies of aggregation and subtle transformation to unearth narratives buried in our collective psyche. Safe Travels (2013) re-creates nine images from airplane safety guides. Enlarged and stripped of context, the panels are unmoored from their instructional purpose. Images that are meant to do the sober work of preparing passengers for emergencies suddenly appear suffused with unintended humor and suggestions of sexuality and violence. The dishonesty of these calm, idealized images is revealed, as is their ambiguous meaning; Lowmans arrangement emphasizes the absurdity inherent in sanitized mass visual culture, where real danger or stark reality is often cheerily replaced by more palatable images and stories. Much of Lowmans work, which includes paintings of smiley faces, bumper stickers, and air fresheners, similarly troubles the seemingly stable and simple meanings of ubiquitous visual signifiers. Lowman is not only interested in cultural semantics, however; he also subtly explores notions of craft. Although even tones and sharp lines give Safe Travels the look of silk screens, they are painstakingly painted by hand. By faithfully re-executing these images in a vaunted artistic medium, Lowman draws attention to the creative work of anonymous graphic artists and the ever-hazy distinction between design and high art.\n",

For Das Beste oder Nichts (2010), Vo appropriated the Mercedes-Benz engine from a car owned by his father Phung Vo, a Vietnamese refugee who had fled the country by boat with his family, became lost at sea, and immigrated to Denmark after being picked up by a Danish commercial ship. Borrowing the works title from the car companys logo, the artist wryly comments on what constituted success for his family once assimilated in Europe. For 2.2.1861 (2009), the artist asked his father, who is a skilled calligrapher, to transcribe the last communication from the French Catholic Saint Theophane Venard to his own father before his execution for proselytizing in Vietnam. Repeatedly writing the work by hand, Phung Vo mails a copy of the letter to each of the works collectors, in a gesture that narrates a wider history of displacement and the vagaries of communicating across cultures.

Prior to being painted, Woods compositions progress through various mediums, beginning with photographs that are collaged before serving as the basis for drawings. He frequently repeats this process by re-collaging his drawings and drawing them again before producing the final painting. The cumulative effect of these layered actions is a flattened perspective, multiple points of view, and a subtle psychological charge. Wood has an abiding fascination with psychology, and his practice mirrors the distortion and conflation of memories as they are revisited in our minds. In Ovitzs Library (2013), Wood applies this method to the home of a renowned art collector in Los Angeles. The painting gauges how Woods memory of the subject mediates his relationship to the space, as well as the ways that the owner is manifested through his home and possessions. In this pseudo object-portrait, the collectors aesthetic tastes and reading habits are all on display. By representing the collector through his self-selected environment, Wood relates another dimension of the vital connection people form with the spaces they inhabit.\n",

The artist bases these audiovisual essays on the model of the expedition: initially setting off in search of a particular topic, she allows her path to be swayed by chance interactions and unexpected discoveries. The resulting stories follow what she calls a synaptic logic, linking the legends and relics of the past with the daily routines of the present through a web of subjective associations. In Four Thousand Blocks (201314), Ga investigated the ancient Pharos lighthouse in Alexandria, Egypt, which stood in the Nile delta for 1,500 years but today lies in ruins underwater, with restricted access and no photography allowed. To learn more about this sites history, Ga moved to Egypt shortly after the 2011 revolution as the country prepared to elect a new government. In the projection on the central screen, she recounts her journey while presenting documents on a glowing light box alongside video and audio footage. Framing this lyrical spoken narrative, two additional screens feature two related forms of storytelling that are fast disappearing: darkroom photography and letterpress typesetting. Weaving these varied formats into a seamless presentation, Ga poetically navigates the murky waters where fact becomes fiction and lived history becomes legend.\n",

When one performer falters, the partner takes over, narrating his/her own timeline from a corresponding moment. Written in collaboration with the artists, each score provides an elastic structure that gracefully expresses the intertwined lives of the performers through nuances of intimacy, intersubjectivity, and memory. In this way, Timelining reflects Gerard &amp; Kellys understanding, in their words, of subjectivity as formed in relation to others, by desire, and always in motion.\nTimelining is presented on the museums Rotunda Floor during special extended hours, Mondays, 5:459 pm.

His sculptures typically incorporate everyday items like clothing, housewares, or sporting goods, bound together using tar, foam, resin, or other materials. Often they also contain embedded audio equipment that warps and amplifies the ambient tones of their surroundings. For Storylines, Beasley has created two new works specifically for the Guggenheims Frank Lloyd Wrightdesigned building. Within this vast and open sonic environment, Strange Fruit (Pair 1) and Strange Fruit (Pair 2) (both 2015) offer an experience of intimacy, absorbing and reflecting the sound of the crowd at the scale of a personal conversation. Each work embodies this spirit of dialogue in its two-part structureat its core are two athletic shoes, one merged with microphones, the other with speakers. Suspending these objects in space, Beasley compounds their technological interchange with additional layers of meaning, bringing to mind the urban phenomenon of shoes hanging from overhead wires or poles (itself an open-ended form of communication). At the same time the works titles refer to history of lynchings in the American South memorialized by Bronx schoolteacher Abel Meerepol in the 1937 protest song Strange Fruit. In these contexts, the hanging forms of Beasleys sculptures resonate not only with his body, which molded them by hand, or with the bodies moving through the museum, but also with those inscribed in the problematic history of race and class in the United States.\n",

In Untitled in the Rage (Nibiru Cataclysm) (2015), the surrounding landscape and the references to Nubian and Egyptian cultures recall a style of portraiture popular in African-American communities, highlighting an aspirational and triumphant portrayal of black identity. At the same time, by adopting an overtly feminized and sexualized posture, the artist, who was born intersex and raised male, emphasizes her body, at once celebrating it and interrogating normative attitudes toward gender and queer sexuality. Huxtable also works in other art forms, including poetry, and the lines between these parts of her practice are fluid. Untitled (Casual Power) (2015) presents a prose poem that alludes to pop-culture and intellectual icons like Lisa Left Eye Lopes and Octavia Butler, while recalling issues that have plagued the black community in New York, from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoovers attempts to undermine the Civil Rights movement during the 1960s and the crack epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s to insurance fraud perpetrated by slumlords.

    "description": "\nDescription\nJuliana Huxtable combines and reinvents cultural histories, questioning the presentation and perception of identity in artworks that often use her own body. In Untitled in the Rage (Nibiru Cataclysm) (2015), the surrounding landscape and the references to Nubian and Egyptian cultures recall a style of portraiture popular in African-American communities, highlighting an aspirational and triumphant portrayal of black identity. At the same time, by adopting an overtly feminized and sexualized posture, the artist, who was born intersex and raised male, emphasizes her body, at once celebrating it and interrogating normative attitudes toward gender and queer sexuality. Huxtable also works in other art forms, including poetry, and the lines between these parts of her practice are fluid. Untitled (Casual Power) (2015) presents a prose poem that alludes to pop-culture and intellectual icons like Lisa Left Eye Lopes and Octavia Butler, while recalling issues that have plagued the black community in New York, from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoovers attempts to undermine the Civil Rights movement during the 1960s and the crack epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s to insurance fraud perpetrated by slumlords. Together with its rich imagery, these references create a complex image of black culture and history in the city.\n",

    "description": "\nDescription\nAgnieszka Kurant is interested in the loss of individual authorship in the face of larger economic and cultural forces and the resulting development of collective intelligence. The End of Signature (2015) embodies technologys outsize role in this erosion, illuminating the decline of handwriting and the dominance of keystrokes and digital communication in contemporary society. In the installation, an autopen endlessly and robotically signs a predetermined signature. Once used as a compromise between an impersonal photocopier and the repetitive act of signing, this outmoded technology relieved an individual from exhaustively confirming his/her authenticity, though paradoxically in a way meant to re-create a precise, physical act. Kurant encourages visitors to contribute their own signatures, which will be collected, combined, and transformed through a software program into one crowd-sourced communal autograph. Projected onto the Guggenheim Museums facade at nightfall, the collective signature is signed and resigned in perpetuity, declaring the multiple identities of museum visitors, the art world, or society at large.\n",
